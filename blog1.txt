"        Hello to all of you, salut à toutes :-)   First off, thanks to all of you who came for the  Movie & Martini extravaganza @ Kim`s . It was COOL. & Kim, thanks for having us. :-)  You Rock!!  I  loved  the videos. They really hit home on how women are so so so negatively portrayed in the ads.  As objects (and not subjects) of our own destiny.... The impact on us is phenomenal. 3000 ads viewed daily. In the next 10 years, you'll be seeing about ten million nine hundred thousand ads. 10,950,000. Most of them, i guess, women.    To continue our discussion on media & women, let's bring magazines to our next meeting. I'd suggested males mags but let's do that another time. I'll get a movie about that another time.   For now, let's stick to women's & girls to keep the impact going.  WHERE: Royal Oak, Laurier street (between King Edward & Cumberland street)  Time: Same as usual 7:30  What you need: 1 magazine. Yourself.    ;-) See you tuesday. Anne-Sophie           "
"       Thanks to Cynthia and Anne-Sophie for the awesome potluck last night.  The food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating.  Well, I hope we didn't create too much of a mess.  See you fabulous gals on Tuesday!  Apryl  P.S. Sex and the City:  Feminist or no?         "
"       Bonjour les petites madames,  This time, I am all inviting you to the Collection, Tuesday, June 15, 7:30pm.  For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.          "
"       Salut!  Here's the update on this week's going ons for tuesday june 22nd.   1) To log on to your account, www.blogger.com then loging with name & password. I sent you all an invite, if you need one again email me cynsophie@yahoo.ca   2)Some of us are going to the golf shooting range at 6 (Jackie, Shoshannah, April, Anne-Sophie, Cynthia, the Swinging Sistahs). If you want to go, email we'll get organized.   WHERE: Rockliffe driving range to shoot a bucket of balls. A free expert giving us tips. It is very cheap $10 for 115 balls (so you share a bucket) and $2 to get clubs. (so $6 each)    3)  7:30  at Apryl's place. She couldn't post her message, so here it is for her.   Hey everyone!  As you know, I've invited y'all to my place for next Tuesday's meeting.  I actually live just in front of Jodi and Kim's place, so it's easy to find.  The address is 283 MacLaren St., and the apt. and buzzer # is 205.  I'm planning to make sangria (with white wine), but feel free to bring whatever you like.   There has been bits and pieces of discussion around Sex and the City and whether or not it can be read as a feminist show.  I would like to show a few clips from the show and hopefully delve deeper into the discussion.  I'm planning to also post some articles on our blog (if I can figure out how to do so).  I've also been reading a lot about Showtime's new series called The L Word, which is a show about a group of lesbians.  I've downloaded a few episodes, and I think it would be interesting to watch some clips and compare the female friendships and love relationships to those of SATC.   I think it would also be very interesting to hear why everyone has joined this group, and what each woman hopes to gain/contribute or discuss in future meetings.  Hope everyone can make it for some sangria and some Sexy conversation!!!     4) New Invitees:   I've added Rebecca & Sabine to join us. So please include them in your emails. They're 2 really awesome girls with great head on their shoulders, mucho pizzaz & style, fab ideas and great life experiences... amongst other things. So Welcome to you both, look forward to seeing you soon.:)     THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY! Can't wait to go golfing. At least this time, my brother won't be there to hit me in the head with his golf club like he did 12 years ago, the bastard! ;)   Anne-Sophie.         "

"       Hello ladies!  I'm looking forward to the collection tomorrow night and seeing some more baby pics.  Anne-Sophie, you are so cute!  You've hardly changed.  Well, I'd like to extend an invitation to the group to come to my home, perhaps for our June 22nd meeting?  I'd be happy to make sangria for everyone and come up with a topic as well.  We can stay here for a couple of hours and then head out, depending on what everyone wants to do.  Vincent has no problem making himself scarce for the evening :)  We can discuss it at tomorrow's meeting!  See you then.  xo Apryl         "

"       Salut à toutes! Hello!  This tuesday, i would like to talk about sports. Not like the guys tho, unless you want to. Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   Anne-Sophie.           "

"   I woke up this morning feeling really depressed...dunno why. last nite b4 going to bed, I prayed to God for me and him...hoping that everything wud be fine with us one day. I prayed for God to give me a sign. Then I dreamt that he was with me and we were about to catch a plane somewhere.  Me n my boyfriend, we've been togather for 3 years. I live here in Singapore and he lives in New York. We keep our relationship going by telephone and by me or him making the effort to fly up to see each other but that happens 2 or 3 times a year depending on whether he can make it here. All the time when we're apart, I feel so 'apart' from him. People ask, why don't u both get married. Well, I guess God is not allowing that to happen yet.  5 months ago I fell into a very deep depression. I was on anti-depressant and I cannot stop crying for days. I became better after afew weeks and I told myself that I never want to go thru this again but now I can feel it creeping back to me and I dunno how to prevent this. My boss came to me at work this morning and ask me why am I so quiet?! He mentioned that he's afraid to see me be so quiet. I didn't respond coz I know that if I did I would break down.  I find my life so unmeaninful. I'm doing things that people close to me wants me to do. If given the choice, I wud just resign from this hell hole of my company and take a break for 3 or 6mths go for a holiday....be with him (my boyfriend) for awhile and come back and do things I want to do.....why is it so difficult for me to make such a decision?  "
"    Hi, my name is Hani. I'm from Singapore. I'm 34years old and still single....life for me lately have been like a topsy turvy and I'm here to let out my feelings, get to know people and to welcome all of you out there to give me your views, your support and your opinions....   Firstly, I have to say the most depressing part of life right now is my job. I hate getting up in the morning going to a job that I don't enjoy, that I think is not fulfilling and meaningless. This job is full of politics and back stabbers. How can I stay long in such an environment? I know that most of you out there will tell me to leave but the money is luring me to stay alittle longer than I should. I'm now looking to do something that I want but I'm lost and confused, dunno where to begin. Than comes my long distance relationship. I've been with a man who prctically lives 20,000miles away from me and if I'm not up there to see him, the only form of contact is the phone and it's not helping me.....  "

"       Excerpt from the official GWB re-election site: 'Kerry Voted For Authorization To Use Force In Iraq. (H.J. Res. 114, CQ Vote #237: Passed 77-23: R 48-1; D 29-21; I 0-1, 10/11/02, Kerry Voted Yea.)  In First Dem Debate, Kerry Strongly Supported President’s Action In Iraq. KERRY: “George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.” (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)  Kerry Later Claimed He Voted “To Threaten” Use Of Force In Iraq. “I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.” (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)  Now, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: “Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it’s been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?” KERRY: “I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don’t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.” (MSNBC’s “Hardball,” 1/6/04)'  Let me get this straight... > He votes for the war > He says he supports the President > Then he says he voted to 'threaten the use of force'  > Now he is anti-war (like he never voted for it.)  HUH?  Do you want a guy who doesn't know what HE thinks leading our country?          "
"          'How many times can this 'flop' flip?          "
"       'I believe that the president's leadership and the actions taken in Iraq demonstrate an incompetence in terms of knowledge, judgment, and experience,' Pelosi told reporters gathered to hear her remarks.     Some Dems Just Don’t Get It! 'The results of his (President Bush) action are what undermine his leadership, not my statements.  The emperor has no clothes. When are people going to face the reality?' 'Bush is an incompetent leader. In fact, he's not a leader. He's a person who has no judgment, no experience and no knowledge of the subjects that he has to decide upon.' '… the president's capacity to lead has never been there.'  'In order to lead, you have to have judgment. In order to have judgment, you have to have knowledge and experience. He (Bush) has none.'  In a time of war, these kinds of public remarks only provide encouragement and comfort to the enemy.  We are at war and our servicemen and women, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to stop evil tyranny and their terrorist activity.  Remarks like these only give more reason for the enemy to continue their attacks on our troops and freedom. These are not remarks made by an “enemy” of the United States….or are they?  Who really is responsible for these words?  None other than Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives.   Are these the kind of statements we would expect from leaders of our government?   Even though Pelosi voted against the war, she promised that Democrats would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Bush in the war on terror. Is this what shoulder-to-shoulder looks like?   At a time of war when America needs to come together, no matter what our political views may be, we find a leader in the Democratic Party, trying to pickup votes for a visionless party and presidential nominee.  Why is it so hard to understand that tyranny and evil will have to be confronted sometime and some place?  On our shores, in our cities, with far more casualties, or right where the enemy lives.           "
"          Kerry makes a gesture displaying the size of his vision for America.  John Kerry is running a whole campaign without an original idea.  He has laid out his platform which basically says: 'Anyone, but Bush;'  'I'll do everything better;'  'If I was President everything would be better.'  Did I miss something?  If it was a one man race John Kerry would have no platform...no one to help him define himself...no one to verbally one up...no one to be criticize for being courageous...  John Kerry is crippled by his need to be accepted by everyone.  This race comes down to a man who has no vision and no spine vs. a President who chooses to do what is right even if it costs him politically.  I choose the guy with a spine and a moral compass.         "
"       President Bush took the advice of the intelligence community and the United Nations that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons.  He chose to trust information from the world and our best and brightest rather than that of a mass murderer.  Since our invasion we have not found what we had been led to believe...  Until now - could we be seeing evidence of these weapons?  Check the link to see this breaking story.   urlLink WMD news          "

"       As I looked at the photos of the tragic and inhumane killing of Nicholas Berg I was horrified.  I was confronting the images of our enemy - the people who would kill our families in the same way.  After observing these photos I want to ask you... Who would you rather lead our country?  John Kerry?   A flip flopping people pleaser who changes his tune...  A man who would treat this as a law enforcement issue rather than a matter of war..  A man who blames us first and our enemies second...  A man who would rather appease instead of taking the hard path of confrontation...  What about George Bush?  He has proven he backs up his words with action.  He calls us time and time again to remember that we are in a war.  This is not a law enforcement issue - we must see this issue differently.  He goes after those responsible and calls the best out of America.  He is a man of conviction who chooses a path he believes in rather than the politically rewarding and safe path.  In this time of terror I will choose the man who has principle, honesty, strength and believes in America.  I encourage you to think of your security and to vote for Bush.         "

"          As Kerry stood looking stoic before the body of Ronald Reagan what was he thinking?    In 1984 campaign literature John Kerry writes:  “We are continuing a defense buildup that is consuming our resources with weapons systems that we don’t need and can’t use.   “The Reagan Administration has no rational plan for our military. Instead, it acts on misinformed assumptions about the strength of the Soviet military and a presumed ‘window of vulnerability,’ which we now know not to exist.   “And Congress, rather than having the moral courage to challenge the Reagan Administration, has given Ronald Reagan almost every military request he has made, no matter how wasteful, no matter how useless, no matter how dangerous.   “The biggest defense buildup since World War II has not given us a better defense. Americans feel more threatened by the prospect of war, not less so. And our national priorities become more and more distorted as the share of our country’s resources devoted to human needs diminishes.”  As we look at the accomplishments of Ronald Reagan and remember that it was his policies that helped tear down the wall of communism, you have to wonder if Kerry will always be on the wrong side of history.  Mr. Kerry - keep the photo ops coming, but we know how you really feel.         "
"          To the man who made us proud to be Americans...  Thank you.         "
"       What if that person was John Kerry?  What if now he was backing off that stance because hindsight is 20/20?  What if he is now pretending to be above the intelligence that pointed to the IRAQ threat?  What if?   BUT - John in his own words states his case for the war in a little documentary found at the GOP site:  urlLink Kerry Documentary    Check it out - be informed - don't let the spin masters get away with their garbage!

"                 As we sat along the roadside for the THIRD time today we both kinda lost it. Well not, kinda, we did for a moment lose it. Two weeks ago as we were headed to Sarasota to help my grandma with some projects around the house the car randomly died! So we coasted along the side of the road from 70 miles an hour to a complete stop. We looked at each other in complete surprise. The car has run great for the year and a half we’ve had it and this was the first sign of any trouble. We called a tow truck and then called my grandma and she and a friend came to meet us at the shop in Bradenton. Fortunately, we weren’t too far from Sarasota. We could definitely see God’s provision in the fact that the car didn’t break down while I was driving it by myself (I’m sure I would be ok, but being in a big city now, I’m not thrilled about breaking down!) and Grandma’s friend was just getting to walk out the door when we called and he knew exactly where we were and was happy to come with her to pick us up. Naturally, as soon as we get to the shop the car starts right up, even though we’d tried to start it for over an hour alongside the road. Two weeks and two shops later, it’s running fine and no one can find anything wrong with it.  So, we head to Sarasota again to help my Grandma with the projects we didn’t get to finish two weeks ago. With two bathroom ventilation fans in our trunk we get almost to Sarasota and boom! The car dies again. Now we can’t believe it. Again, God was with us and we were able to make it off an exit ramp. Ked called the tow truck and I called Grandma. She can’t believe it. So I walk across the street to McDonald’s and Ked stays with the car. Just as the tow truck shows up the car starts! Now we’re getting annoyed. Grandma shows up, we all shake our heads and head to her place for breakfast.  We had a great day with her as Ked and I replaced the fans in her bathroom. Ked was covered in dust and his arms were tired from being above his head, but we successfully replaced the fans in both her bathrooms. Unfortunately, the holes from the old fans are bigger than the hole for the new fans, so Ked will be making some trim and taking it back down to cover the hole. That is, if we can ever make it back down there.  It was a cold and rainy day, but we decided to head back to our place. What should have been an hour trip took us four hours. The car broke down halfway and we sat alongside the road for at least an hour. We called a tow truck, but true to form, it started again before the tow truck arrived. We drive twenty minutes more and it stops again. This time we decide NOT to call a tow truck and wait it out. Obviously, something is overheating and it just needs to cool down and it starts again. By now, we are tired, dirty and frustrated. And we start to doubt God. It’s amazing how something like this can make you question your foundation. And so we talk. Why does this always happen to us? In our seven year marriage we’ve been stranded alongside the road more times than I can count, and it’s not like we drive junker cars. And we start to doubt all kinds of things, like God’s faithfulness to us, why He hasn’t blessed us more in the area of finances, and so on and so on. We’ve been sitting there an hour and the car still won’t start. This time we’re afraid it’s not going to start again. But in that time as we’ve talked we’ve realized where our faith is weak. If something really so silly and stupid as a car breaking down (fact of life, they just aren’t reliable) we need to re-evaluate where we stand in our faith. So we prayed together, not for the car to be healed, but for our faith to be healed. We desire so desperately to be used by God. To do something marvelous for Him, to use all of our potential, and to hear “well done, good and faithful servant!” And so our time in the car gave us time to reflect and ask God not to hide His plan for us, and to help us live our lives to the fullest for Him, even when we’re broken down alongside the road. Finally after an hour, I have to go to the bathroom REALLY bad. Actually, I’ve had to go for quite awhile. So we call for help and arrange for a tow truck to come and get us. And would you believe it? Ked hangs up the phone and tries the car one more time, and it starts right up. We look at each other in amazement.   Was God just trying to tell us to ask for help? I don’t know if He works in ways like that, but it seems to be a good illustration. Just pick up the phone – get on your knees and ask Me for help! If we learned anything by our three hours by the roadside, it’s that we aren’t alone, even when we feel like it, and sometimes we just need to reach out and ask for help.  We finally made it home, exhausted, drained and ready for bed.                "
"                  I love it when a plan comes together!   Don't you love it when God answers a prayer right away? That doesn't always happen, because our timing isn't always His timing. But now and then our timings match up and when we whisper a 'please, God' Boom! We see the answer not much later. I love that about God. He's so big and awesome.  Ked's sister Karon has been looking forward to coming to visit with us in the sunshine for awhile. Plans here and there kept falling through and then a seemingly perfect plan for her to catch a ride with a cousin was all in place. It was going to work out great! Ked and I were a little bummed though because this particular plan meant we wouldn't get to see her as much as we would have liked, but nonetheless we knew how desperately she needed a vacation and we were excited to see her no matter how short it would be. She called us this morning and said now that plan had fallen through too and the cousin wasn't going to be able to come. We were all disappointed. She had already taken the time off work, and she needed to get away. Frankly, we needed the company too. All day long we all thought about it. We chatted again earlier this evening and she was checking for plane tickets online, but everything was so expensive and to get a good price she'd have to drive a few hours. I pulled out my laptop and whispered a 'please, God, you know how much she needs a vacation. Can you please help us to find an amazing price on a ticket?' I searched a few of my usual spots and nothing too great came up unless she was willing to drive over 2 hours to an airport.  So I called her again later and told her what I did find. In the meantime she was about ready to throw her computer out the window. She had found a good price and was willing to drive the couple hours. Just as she was going to book the ticket she got booted off the internet and had to restart. As she was rebooting I kept checking. I said 'hey, have you checked the Grand Rapids airport?' (only 45 minutes away). She replied that she hadn't even checked them because they are usually so much more expensive. Figuring we had nothing to lose I checked the flights from GR. 'Karon, you are NOT going to believe what I just found!!' I found tickets out of Grand Rapids for way less than anything else we had found today. When I told her the dates and the price she squealed, 'BOOK IT!! Here's the credit card number!!' That is just like God. She now has a better vacation planned than any of her previous options. The price was right, out of the most convenient airport, and she gets to spend more time here than any of her other options provided, thanks to the good flight schedules.  Thank you, God for listening to our heart's desires and knowing what we need. And thank You for Hotwire.com!!  Can't wait to see you Tuesday, sis!!!!               "
"                  Alright, already! I'm here!   Wow! I miss one day and I get scolded for being lazy! You know who you are, big dog!! =) Just teasin ya. It's nice to know you're reading. Ok, so I'm back. I'm still sniffling and coughing, but I'm on the mend! In fact yesterday I thought I was all better, but this morning I woke up miserable again. It's crazy.  Due to my lovely sniffles I've been taking it fairly easy this week. My current writing assignment is to write vivid observations using each of my five senses. Yesterday after a nice cool rain, I decided to sit on the porch and describe the fresh, after-rain smell. Well, I walked onto the porch and realized, 'what am I thinking? I can't smell anything!!' I guess that assignment will have to wait until next week!  Sometimes honesty costs. I went in today to get my address corrected on my driver's license. When we first moved here I was getting the numbers in our address all mixed up. By the time I got myself unconfused, I realized the address on my license was wrong. I went in today to get it corrected and when I told the gentleman at the counter the correct address, he asked, 'was this just a typo or did you move?' I thought for half a second that if I told him it was a typo I could probably save myself the cost of getting it changed ($10!!). But I knew that I had given it to them wrong the first time, but they would never know. But I would know. So I told him 'When we first moved I kept getting the numbers mixed up, and I'm sure I gave it to you wrong.' He just peered at me over his glasses  with funny look and then said 'that will be $10.' I suppose that $10 is worth having a clean conscience and a good night's sleep.  While I've been nursing my sniffles the past couple days, I've indulged myself by scrapbooking. I'm working on finishing up the pictures from our  urlLink Alaska trip  last August. That trip seems like such a long time ago! We came back from that trip, turned in our two weeks notices and moved three weeks later. With all that flurry of activity, we really didn't have time to reflect much on our trip after we returned. It's been so much fun to relive those memories as I've scrapbooked the pictures. It makes me want to go on another adventure!! Ked and I LOVE traveling together. There's nothing like bonding as you end up in all these fun and unusual circumstances together. You just never know what or who you'll encounter, like the time we stood up in 2 complete strangers' wedding in South Dakota. Ahh... I'll save that one for another day...to keep you coming back for more!!! =)  Later!               "
"                  Oh I Love a Rainy Night!   I love the sound of rain. There's something soothing about the sound of the earth being refreshed. It's almost as if while the earth soaks up the life-giving water my own soul participates in the watering. The wind starts whistling in the windows and the rain then begins slowly pelting on the roof. I hear the “ting-ting-ting” as each raindrop hits the top of the chimney. The speed of the rain picks up until you can’t identify a single raindrop, but it’s a continual sheet of rain. A car drives by and I hear the splash of the tires running through the puddles collected in the parking lot. What is it about rain that causes us to desire to slow down and want to curl up under a blanket with a book? Could it be that God created rain not just to refresh the earth and keep it green but also to refresh us from our hectic lives and give ourselves permission to slow down?               "
"                  Froggie Went a Courtin'   Well, I still kinda sound like a frog today, but I feel much better than yesterday! I took it as easy today as a Type A personality driven person can when they're sick (that means the house still got cleaned and dinner made before Ked got home!)  Last night Ked's cousin Kristin called to let us know that she had a basketball game nearby tonight. Ked was able to get off work a little early and the two of us headed over to the game. It was in a small gym with a concrete floor and reminded us of a gym you might see at a camp. Every time a girl fell and we heard that screech of skin on the floor we cringed with sympathy pain! We were about the only fans there for Kristin's Lions and we had a blast cheering them on. She scored 5 points and her team won by 20. Well, the game ended pre-maturely in the 4th quarter with about 6 minutes to go. The opposing team had three girls get hurt on that unforgiving concrete, and they were forced to finish play since they only had three girls left! We were glad Kristin invited us, and we think it meant a lot to her that we could come. After all, this is the type of stuff that counts in life - being there for people that you love. If it means taking off work a little early to show someone that they are important enough for you to take time to show up, it's worth it.  Go Lions!               "
"                  A Heart's Desire   I thought I'd share something with you that I wrote for my writing course. The assignment asked me to describe my heart's desire for my inner spiritual life. Have you ever been to a natural spring? Ked and I discovered one not far from here. It was absolutely beautiful and the inspiration for my answer.   I step up to the edge of my soul and look into a deep spring. The water is crystal clear, and full of life. I step in and experience the spring's refreshment that comes from years of discipline to keep the spring pure and unpolluted. The water is the perfect temperature and surrounds me with joy and hope. Others also come to the spring for refreshment and relaxation. Whether they spend a day or just a few minutes, all leave renewed and ready to take on the world. Everything that surrounds the spring is lush and green with deep roots that can withstand the storms of life. When the rains come, others run and hide, but the spring stands firm allowing the rains to make it deeper and stronger with more life-giving water to offer to its surroundings.   In other news, I woke up this morning and sounded like a frog!! Last night my throat was feeling scratchy. It was a real bummer. Ked and I had planned a picnic and rollerblading at a state park nearby this afternoon, but instead I spent the day on the couch! Win some, lose some.  Do ya like the look of the blog? Ked designed it for me this afternoon. Thanks, sweetie. You're awesome!!               "
"                   A Day in the Life of Best Friends    I can't believe after 6 1/2 years of marriage how much fun Ked and I still have together. It was a fun lazy day. As we skipped arm in arm through the grocery store tonight, I commented to Ked about how much fun we have together. He responded 'We've been best friends for almost ten years!' Wow.   This afternoon we took a walk to enjoy the sunshine and then sat by the pool for awhile. (Just had to mention that for all our ohioans and michiganders. We love you!) We dipped our toes in the water, but chose not to get in. The heated pool was closed for repairs, and although we're still Northerners at heart, the unheated pool was just too cold for us! These lazy days together are what make life so enjoyable, just enjoying each other's presence and laughing together.   Later, we hit the town in search of some new shoes for Ked. We found the most amazing discovery since we moved here - MJM Designer Shoes - a.k.a. Shoe Heaven!! With unbelievable prices on brand name shoes, Ked had a hard time choosing, and I had a hard time resisting! We petted the nice leather Kenneth Coles and oohed and ahhed over others. It's not only shoe heaven, but sale heaven! Just walking down the aisles and aisles of shoes marked retail for $109 and on sale for $39.99 produced enough endorphins to count for hours of working out! Vowing to return, we were quite proud of ourselves that we walked out with only what we walked in for!   On the way home we swung by Hollywood Video for their $9.99 package of 2 rentals, 2 popcorns, 1 candy and one soda. After paying $8 a pop for a movie ticket a couple weeks ago, we decided that snuggling on the couch munching popcorn through two movies was not only more comfortable, but better bang for the buck. We'll save the big screen prices for must-see experiences.  Ahhh....I love Saturdays!               "
"                 I really should be in bed already since I have an early morning. Tomorrow we are having a brunch for the women's ministry at church. I'm co-chairing the event, which so far has just meant showing up at 7:45 tomorrow morning and proof reading some stuff. I'm looking forward to getting to know some more ladies and hearing the message that Bernadette has prepared. She is one of the pastor's wives at church that I have gotten to know over the past few months. She's become kind of like an older sister which is cool. She's been very encouraging and we are enjoying being in Bible study together on Thursday mornings.  Ked is once again practicing his C and E chords. Only this time he tuned the guitar and it sounds so much better. I gave it a try tonight too. Now that was interesting. I think my fingers need to grow a couple inches. Ked said I'll have to clip my nails cuz they're getting in the way. Dog gone it! For once I actually have nails and now they're in the way. I really think we should take lessons rather than trying to learn on our own. As much as we love music, it would be really fun to learn together and play together.  So far the new car is working out great. It sure is a fun ride!                "
"                 I must say that I am quite proud of myself!! I just added a couple new sections to the left of my blog - adding links to other blogs I like, and books I'm reading! I figured out how to code all this new stuff in all by myself! I didn't even have to ask Ked to help me. Of course if I had royally screwed it up I would have yelled 'Keeeeeeeeeeeeedddd!!' =)   I've made a commitment to read 24 books this year. It may be a little ambitious, but hey, shoot for the stars and if you hit the moon you've still made progress! I've finished two so far and I'm cooking on the third. I remember those lazy summer days as I kid when I would just read and read and read. That's probably why I had to get glasses in second grade and my eyes are so bad now! When I first got my glasses the eye doctor told my Mom to tell me to go outside more often. My Mom said 'she does, she sits outside and reads!' I'd read on the porch, in the tree (and spy on the neighbor boys while peering over my book!) and late at night in my bed with a flashlight! I just couldn't get enough. I'd see how many times I could finish the library reading program in the summer, cooking through it at least twice if not three times. Somewhere during high school and adulthood some of the joy of reading was lost. Maybe it was the Business Law book that I just couldn't stay awake through, maybe it was Statistics or just the fact that I was being forced to read. But I just didn't enjoy it as much. And then, when I did enjoy it, I felt guilty for sitting curled up under a blanket for hours on end with a book I just couldn't put down. Part of me said, 'read, read faster and just get through it! You can't stop now!' And two hours later the laundry still needed folded, the dishes were in a pile, and the dirty bathrooms calling my name. Maybe reading wasn't as pleasurable because in the back of my mind there was always something else to do. I remember a comment one of my professors in college made my freshman year. He said, 'whether or not you finish college, keep reading. As long as you are reading you'll continue learning and growing.' So I've decided to recapture that joy of reading this year. Now that I'm finally done with school maybe I can appreciate it more. Yes, there will always be the responsibilities calling my name, but a half hour, an hour, or occasionally that sweet dessert of a few hours, won't hurt.  As for now, my bed is calling my name. Actually, Ked is calling my name first. He's asking, 'What's a chord?' as he strums on the guitar we inherited from my Dad. Ked is a singer, musician, and rockstar at heart. He wants so badly to learn to play the guitar this year. He found some internet site tonight, and learned 2 chords, but he doesn't know what a chord is. He's telling me, 'this is E, and this is C.' But the guitar is so out of tune they sound the same!! Needless to say, he's strumming away on C and E, well we think anyway. I suppose that's better than just randomly strumming away imagining he's a star like he used to do. Let's see if I can remember enough of my music training to teach him how to read music and what a chord is. Oh, if this blog only had audio, you would truly enjoy this bed time concert!! He's got the Johnny Cash look down, wearing all black tonight. Let's hope the talent follows!  ROCK ON KED!!               "
"                 Tonight we retired our faithful, rusty, blue Michigan license plate. *sigh* If that plate could talk... For seven years it served us faithfully through two vehicles and 200,000 miles. From getting lost in New York city to climbing the Smokies to camping out in the Black Hills, we've had some great times with that blue plate! Big blue also sat alongside the roadside with us every time we broke down, which throughout our travels have been too many times to count! Our first license plate, with so many memories attached to it. Now we will hang you on our wall as a reminder of all our fun times together!  It was a long day today, and we're both really tired! Tonight we drove home a newer car. We feel like we got a good deal, and it has 60,000 less miles than our previous car. Ah, time will tell. We both stopped caring about cars through this whole process. We got to the point where we're like 'just find something reliable and safe with good gas mileage!'  Well, goodnight world!               "
"                 Last night Ked and I sat down together to watch Diane Sawyer's interview with Mel Gibson. Like many churches across the country, ours has purchased advanced tickets to 'The Passion of the Christ' and is encouraging people to take their neighbors and friends and then have dessert or coffee afterward to talk about the movie. What impressed me most about Mel's interview was his unwavering belief in this dream come true. He's been run through the mill of the press over the past year, and it was nice to see someone standing firm in the face of criticism for something they believe in. No matter where you stand on the spectrum of the movie, give Mel some credit. He took a huge risk, not only financially, but personally and professionally. He told the actor playing Jesus 'you realize you may never work again.' It was also nice to hear him say to Diane 'I am a believer, by the way, in case you hadn't figured that out.' It's like he was tired of playing the game and just laid all his cards on the table and told it the way he believed it. For that I give him credit. Such courage and passion in the face of fire is commendable. Ked and I also discussed how this is probably one of the most meaningful works to ever come out of Hollywood. This movie is sparking conversations in households, with neighbors, and among different faiths. We are talking about something so important, but it took a movie for us to bring it up. Ked and I haven't decided yet if we will go see the movie. We both have soft hearts and sensitive stomachs. I remember sitting in high school Bible class while the teacher read a medical description of what Jesus suffered during those 12 hours. I was nauseous and weak. I'm also the kind of person that if you tell me about your broken arm, my arm hurts. To watch such pain and anguish and to imagine that's what I put my savior through, I just don't know if my body can handle it.               "
"                 I caught Oprah this afternoon and the final round of her Pop Star competition. This is her mini version of American Idol, but for older people. It was very interesting to watch these final three sing their hearts out for their dream. Each one of them had a vision from the time they were young to sing and record. Now they are in their 30's and 40's and felt their time was running out, since most of your stars gain their recognition in their late teens and twenties. These moms and dads had a sparkle in their eye and passion in their voices as they spoke about their dream of a recording contract. Simon Cowell from American Idol was one of the judges and he made an interesting comment. He said he believed that these hopefuls sang better and with more passion than the young people on American Idol. 'These people want it more,' he commented. LaShell especially spoke to my heart. She kept saying that she was so 'blessed' to have this opportunity. This mother of FIVE from Motown clung to her dream despite the odds. She sang her heart out and won my vote. You go, girl! Even Simon told her she did fabulous and should win. This lady made me stop and consider my dreams. Do I have the fortitude to stick with my dreams against all odds? If it takes years longer than I anticipate, can I hang in there and keep believing, dreaming and hoping? If I truly believe God has called me to do something (for example, write) will I keep the faith even if it takes years and years for it to happen? I tend to become so impatient. We waited for three years to move to Florida, and at times, I have to admit I never thought the dream would be fulfilled. God's timing is not ours, but it certainly is perfect. I can look back over my life and see that, but when I'm in the middle of it, it's altogether too easy to feel forgotten and give up hope. LaShell, girl, I hope you win! Thanks for inspiring all of us to stand by our dreams even if it takes years longer than we anticipated.                "
"                 Today was a long and tiring day! We started out early and helped some friends move into their new house. It was a beautiful day for their move, and not even the drizzle later in the day could dampen their excitement to get into their newly built house. I have to say, I did pretty good about not coveting. Ever since we moved here I've wanted our own house so badly. I'm starting to get the itch to nest and I can't wait to be able to paint and decorate our own place. God's been working on me about not coveting since it seems like everyone else we know has their own house. We've helped so many people move into and paint their houses. It's been a big issue for me and many times I feel like we'll never own our own place. It just seems impossible. I have to keep giving it up to God over and over again. So I can honestly say I am excited for our friends and their new house, and when those twinges of jealousy started to creep up, I stomped them out and ignored them.  After we left their place we drove to a car dealership to look at some cars. It's still frustrating, and we're not excited to be looking for a car. We're thankful that our current one is still running and we're praying it will continue to do so until we find another one. We kind of walk around the lot despondently looking at the cars. We found one that might work yesterday, but it's a little out of our price range. So we keep looking. We came home just exhausted and watched some mindless tv before heading to bed. Whenever a car commercial came on I made Ked change the channel. I'm tired of looking at cars and trying to be lured into something nice that we can't afford! I think I have to agree with one of our friends who recently was having car trouble with BOTH his cars - cars are from the devil!!               "
"                 The past couple days have been fun! Last night we had a Valentine's potluck and party with our Life Group. We held it at our leader's new home and there were eight couples that came. It's always enjoyable to socialize (especially over food!). Our leaders announced that they are expecting and due in August. It seems like lately there's been one announcement a week! Ked and I moderated a group game of 'Newlyweds' where the guys and the gals answered questions about their likes and favorites and the spouses had to guess the correct answer. Everyone did pretty well! Afterward we were sitting around talking about how long each couple has been married. It shocked everyone to realize that we had been married the longest (almost 7 years, my how time flies!) and that we're some of the youngest in the group! One guy asked if we had gotten married in Junior High! We can honestly say it's been the best 7 years of our lives. It hasn't always been easy and we don't expect it to be, but it's so worth it. The joy far outweighs the work.  We never really do much for Valentine's Day. I've always considered it more of a Hallmark holiday. Flowers and cards mean more to me when they're given out of spontaneity rather than duty because the calendar says you have to. We usually just use it as a good reason to out to eat and see a movie. Last year, we tried to go out on Valentine's and every place we went to was a 2-3 hour wait. We were so hungry we couldn't wait so I think we ended up at Steak and Shake! This year we decided to avoid the madness and go out the day before. We went to the Macaroni Grill and our Valentine's treat was splitting a yum-a-licious tiramisu! After dinner we went and saw the movie 50 First Dates. We both agreed that this was the best Adam Sandler movie ever, and Drew Berrymore was precious. It's always fun to go to a movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. The theme of the movie is his unconditional love for her even though he knows she'll never be able to fully return that love since she won't remember him the next day! It was worth our $8 ticket.   I think Ked just put up the new onPO!NT Media Group site. Check it out at   urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com  . It's a sweet site and gives a good picture of what Ked is capable of designing. If you ever need or know of someone who needs web design or graphic design work, please point them to onPO!NT media group!               "
"                 It's amazing how quickly the days fly by, the sun in your face, the wind in your hair... o.k. enough of the gloating! =) Ked stayed home from work again today. He went to the Dr. this morning and when he walked in the door I asked what the verdict was. He grins and said 'I'm a big wussy!' Apparently he has a virus of some kind and not strep throat. He spent most of the day on the couch. I was a good wifey and went to the store to re-stock on chicken noodle soup and crackers.  I've been having fun with my new sewing machine. Ked thinks it's so funny and amazing that I can do something so domesticated as sew! I've been working on a nice denim jacket and I must say, I'm quite proud of it! I got two free lessons with my new machine and today was the second class. The first class was quite eventful.  A lady came in and sat down next to me. When she took the case off her machine a BIG, at least 5 inch cockroach scurried out of her machine. That was quite a thrill! We spent the first few minutes squealing and looking for something to kill it with. Today was rather uneventful though, and there were no more cockroaches, thankfully! So, now I know how to use my machine and Ked wants a pair of dress pants. Hmmm...this will be interesting! Good thing my mama taught me well!                 "
"                 This past week has been a different one since Ked has been sick. I don't like it when he's sick; I wish there was more I could do to help him get better. There's only so much chicken soup and Nyquil you can administer. My brother just can't believe that we would get sick down here. He thinks that our bodies just assume they are supposed to be sick because it's winter, even though it's warm and sunny! Ked's finally starting to feel better. Hopefully in the next couple days he will be all better.  No news on the car yet. Ked went out looking on Saturday. It's been driving ok back and forth to work. The unpredictability is frustrating. You just never know when you might not make it to your destination!   Well, I guess that's all for tonight!               "
"                 Ked took the car to the dealership today and the prognosis was not good. It appears that the engine is burning oil. Ked added 2 quarts yesterday and it seems that the car was turning off due to lack of oil. The dealership advised us that the car needs a new engine which would cost about $7500. At this point putting a new engine in would cost more than the car is worth. This is frustrating beyond words especially since we only bought the car a year ago and it has less than 100,000 miles on it. But what can you do? We know that all we can do is control our attitudes and not let our testimony down. Ked had a non-Christian co-worker today comment on Ked’s positive outlook through all of this. Wouldn’t it be awesome if God would use something as frustrating as this as a chance for us to share the reason for our positive outlook? We know that cars are a temporary thing, and we seek to live in view of what matters most in eternity, and it doesn’t include our car! So it looks like we will be in the market for a different car over the next few weeks. It’s certainly not something we were planning on doing for a couple more years. We hope we can trade it in and not be set back too far financially.  In other news today, I have decided to fast from internet surfing. I have spent way too many hours just browsing and surfing. I don’t know, I think I was trying to find the end of the internet or something! This morning as I was reflecting on my values and my goals I decided that keeping up on all the latest celebrity gossip and reality tv show news didn’t fit my priorities. And so for the month of February, I will only surf the internet as it becomes necessary to research and read for my correspondence writing course. Ked asked me what I was going to do with my newfound freedom. I thought for a second and said “Read and write more!'                "
"                 We spent the day pretty much hanging around home today. After yesterday’s incidents with the car we were afraid to go anywhere. We slept in after the exhausting evening of just trying to get home. Later in the afternoon we really needed groceries, so we drove just a couple miles to Sam’s and Wal-Mart. Not being football fans we completely forgot that today was the SuperBowl! It was a total zoo out there with everyone buying all kinds of unhealthy snack foods for the big game. Ked managed to find a good line and we were out of there in no time. This was a break through for him because he is known for always picking the slowest line in the store. If someone is going to have a problem checking out they will be in front of him! So he was rather proud of himself and hopes this starts a winning streak!   But the adventure wasn’t over. We load our groceries in the car and then we can’t get it to start. Oh, but this time it’s because the key won’t turn. We’ve had this trouble before, and it has something to do with the steering wheel being locked up. Ked fiddled with the key and the steering wheel for over ten minutes. We even pulled out the manual for the car. Desperate times call for desperate measures! Finally the key turned and we rushed home, never to go out again!  We just hope Ked can make it to work ok tomorrow and that the dealership in town can look at it, and this time find what’s wrong with it!                "
"                  You Can't Fake That   Hey a big shout out and welcome to the blogging world,  urlLink Karon ! Looking forward to reading your stuff! Check out her link to the right under 'Discussing the Point.'  Tonight Ked shared with me a conversation he had today with someone we've been bringing before the Throne. It was one of those conversations that sent chills down my spine. This person is truly seeking. Two months ago he claimed to be agnostic and possibly even atheist. Today he said he's no longer either. He believes there is a God. He's just trying to figure out where he fits into the God story. What sent chills down my spine was the realization that we can have influence and not even realize it. He informed Ked today that he's 'researched' Ked's family and come to the conclusion that we're for real. Apparently by 'research' he looked up all he could find about us on the internet. Somehow he came across our  urlLink Alaska  site and I'm guessing  urlLink Jest Kidding's  as well. He told Ked that what we did in Alaska and how we live our lives - in his words - 'you can't fake that $!##$.' I never dreamed when we put together the Alaska site that it would help someone see real faith in action.  It's so cool to watch this journey. Sometimes after being a believer for so long and surrounded by so many other believers we forget what that journey is like.  Humbled,               "
"                  Why can't I just jump in?   Today was another beautiful day, and I decided I could wait until a cloudy day to clean the bathrooms. I lathered up with sunscreen, loaded a bag full of books and headed to the pool. It was a perfect day to recline in the sun and catch up on some reading. While I lounged in my chair reading and intermittently taking phone calls for  urlLink OPMG , it occurred to me that I was starting to live the life I had always dreamed of. Finally, I am able to do what I enjoy most – manage projects, study, read, and run our household – and all while working for my favorite boss of all time – Ked!   As I sat pondering this thought, a scene unfolded before me that caused me to realize that, although I’m heading in the right direction, something is holding me back from a truly full life. A couple of adorable kids came and started playing in the pool. The two were strangers to each other, but seemed like old friends as they splashed around together. The girl, a cute brunette about 9 years old, stepped into the pool. She proclaimed to her dad “it’s not that bad!!” threw her neon yellow ring into the pool and jumped in after it. She started squealing and splashing and enjoying the refreshing water. After splashing around for awhile, the little boy proclaimed to all of us on the sidelines “watch me flip into the pool!” He hurled himself in, a little too close to the edge. When he came up, we asked him if he was o.k. He didn’t want to admit that he was hurt, but he slightly rubbed his head and then buried his face in his mom’s lap. She comforted him for awhile and then they headed home. He never jumped back into the pool.  I smiled as I watched these two play so fearlessly and uninhibited. My mind drifted back 18 years. I remember being like the girl and spending my summers at the city pool. I was fearless. There wasn’t a stranger I didn’t know, and I loved the water. I’d cannonball, belly flop, and even occasionally get brave enough to jump off the high dive. I could spend all day in the water without a care for what the people sitting along the edge were thinking of me.   I long for those childhood days of passionate living, free from fear. Although I’m starting to live the life God has designed for me, I’ve been avoiding something. I’ve felt God call me to a certain task for years. Occasionally, I’ll dip my toes in the water, but soon I head back to my chair by the poolside. I feel a pull to jump in and  really  swim. But it’s easier to sit by the edge, unnoticed, and peer over my book at everyone else enjoying the water. I’d like to play and enjoy the refreshment like that little girl, but today I’m more like the little boy. It’s not that I hit my head once, but it’s the fear of hitting my head that keeps me on the edge. What if I jump in, look like a fool, and get hurt? What if I think I know how to swim, but really I don’t?  Gradually, everyone left and I was the only one sitting by the pool. My book now sat on the table next to me. I decided I can’t spend the rest of my life watching what’s happening in the pool. I have to jump in. Even though I know it won’t be all play, there’s still certain refreshment from swimming laps. I technically know how to do what I feel God has called me to do. I’ve had the lessons, I’ve got the talent, and I’ve read the books. I think it’s time to just jump in and start swimming. I may flail around, and I may just float for awhile, but eventually I’ll start swimming like God intended me to. But that will never happen unless I first jump in.                 "
"                  Death by Taxes   It's been said that there are two things in life that are certain - death and taxes. Tonight, I think it's death by taxes!! Ked and I figured our federal taxes, and started on the MI state. Fortunately there is no FL state income taxes (a factor in moving here!) Our office looks like a tornado hit with multiple W-2's and moving receipts scattered all over the room. It wasn't pretty. It never is. Our taxes are never simple. I can't even imagine how bad it would have been if it weren't for good ole George W's tax breaks and then all our moving expenses (which we added up the grand total for the first time - ouch!). Needless to say, it was a depressing evening.  Ked just headed back to work. Yes, it's been a weird day. They're finally going live with UT's website at midnight, when it has the least amount of traffic. Hopefully it won't take too long.   Well, all my mental energy has been sapped out of me. Good night!               "
"                  Beach Hair   Today was another beautiful day, as you can see by the weather box I have added to my site in the upper right corner. You see, the object is to keep you all as jealous as I possibly can so that you will come and visit often and that some of you will even move here eventually!  Ked and I took to the beach this afternoon. We headed down to Ft DeSoto where Karon and I hung out since Ked had never been there before. Talk about traffic! Wow! The spring breakers are here in full force. In just a small section of the parking lot, I counted plates from 10 different states from Maine to Quebec (although I guess technically Quebec isn't a state). Even though the beach was packed, we managed to find a small piece of real estate to claim as our own for a few hours. We jumped right into the Gulf with our masks and snorkels and scoured the gulf floor for sand dollars and treasures. We didn't find anything though because the water was too choppy and it looked rather picked over. Still it was fun and we left with fantastic beach hair do's!     While laying on the beach I gave Jay-bird a call and chatted with him and his lady. I deviously waited for them to ask what we were up to today and then casually replied 'oh, nothin much, just laying on the beach!' I think my plan is working!! (evil laugh, ha ha ha!!)  Anyway, a few of you have asked to see a picture of the car we recently bought. We washed it yesterday and she looks all pretty! Except, now we have to vacuum it again because we tracked sand in it today. Awww, you feel sorry for us I'm sure! So here's the pic!     Well, as soon as I finish my pizza I need to take a shower to get rid of the sand. Later               "
"                  Torrid \TOR-id\ adjective   1: parched with heat especially of the sun : hot  *2 : ardent, passionate   Part of my current assignment through my Christian Writers Guild course is to begin finding new and interesting words. So I signed up for  urlLink Merriam-Websters  word of the day e-mail list. Today's word evoked some torrid emotions within me as I thought that I could still be in Michigan suffering the misery of March instead of enjoying the torrid Florida weather. Anyway, be on the lookout. I'll probably start using some of my fun, new words of the day on you!  Ked and I decided to catch a matinee of Starsky & Hutch this afternoon and it turned out to be quite the adventure! First I check online and see there's a showing at 1:40 p.m. We cruise on over to the theater to discover the times online were wrong and there is no 1:40 showing, it's not until 5:05!! So we chowed down some Chinese and then strolled through the shops in the complex looking at all the things we can't buy at Family Christian Stores, Michaels and Best Buy.  (Speaking of the Family Christian store, our store down here is horrible! We would spend hours browsing the books and listening to the sample cd's at the store on CU's campus. This store's music is soooo old they couldn't give it away! It's like stepping back in time!)    Finally we head back to see the movie. After it was too late, we realized we had picked bad seats. A few seats down sat an older couple who started commentating the previews. Yes, and that continued through the ending credits! Although it was quite annoying, at the same time their out of touch comments were at times pretty funny. 'They got the wrong house, oh, they got the wrong house!' When the original Starsky & Hutch made a cameo near the end, the lady felt the whole theater wouldn't catch the fact that 'Those two are the originals!!' Oh, my. We got a little more than we bargained for with our $6 tickets.                "
"                  A wakeup call that came WAY to early!   Thursdays are always a fun day. I usually have Bible studies with the ladies in the morning, but it's spring break week so we're takin the week off. Then in the evenings we have Life Group, which is always a blast. But this morning began WAY to early!  If you remember I mentioned a couple blogs ago about Sadie and her shiny, fuzzy balls that she kicks around like soccer balls and is ALWAYS losing under the t.v., behind the bookcase, under the couch. Well  very  early this morning she apparently lost one behind the metal filing cabinet in our bedroom. It's 4:45 a.m. and we are rudely awakened by 'thud, thud, thud' as she begins to paw at the filing cabinet in an attempt to get the ball out. And on and on it went until I dragged myself out of bed and sprayed her with the handy squirt bottle we keep nearby for such occasions. Five minutes later just as I'm drifting off to sleep again 'thud, thud, thud.' I spray her again and this went on several times until we somehow in our sleepy state managed to kick her out of the room and shut the door. Then she pawed at the door to get back in until she realized that wasn't going to happen! I tell ya, she wasn't so cute anymore!  So tonight we had Life Group and we're going through a six week marriage study on conflict. I confess, for a variety of reasons, Ked and I were  really  dragging our feet into this study, (and we were facilitating tonight!) It's not that we're perfect, but conflict has never really been a big issue for us. We both have always put a lot of effort into communicating with each other and over the years we've developed a very transparent relationship. Transparency (our topic for tonight) is something we both value and it flows rather freely in our relationship. We also have trouble with studies (such as this one) that list 'these are the four steps to be transparent!' That's a discussion for another time. So, although this study isn't where we're at and was kind of a lot of 'blah, blah, blah' for us, we prayed that we wouldn't let that show and that God might somehow use us. We know that it will most likely meet others in the group where they are and we want to be a helpful part of that process, not a hindrance. As always, the evening was enjoyable, full of stimulating conversation and thoughtful input, and I can honestly say we thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and gained insight from the others in the group. We have a great group of couples who always inject humor and honesty into the discussions. So, despite the dragging of our own feet, I think it turned out well, and we are looking forward to the rest of the study.  Wise, insightful, poetic...not necessarily true, but I like it, oh mighty Falcon!               "
"                 Welcome to the world of blogging,  urlLink Chris R ! Ked told me about yours today. We'll look forward to seeing those engagement pics! You ask 'How can it be?' on all those occasions at work where something isn't working out and at the last minute it pulls together?? Well, that's just the way it goes at RBC, from my experience!!  Today was pretty uneventful. I had a nice chat with my Mom on the phone. She's the coolest. She never ceases to amaze me at her wealth of knowledge when it comes to wifely duties and sewing. She's rattling stuff away and I'm scrambling for a pen and paper. 'Wait, back up. How does that work again?'  I finally feel like I'm falling into a routine. It's taken 6 months, but I think I'm getting into the swing of things. It's helped that business is really picking up for  urlLink OPMG , praise Jesus!   So, I think that's it for today!               "
"                  We were meant to live   Well, I see that the Falcon has finally responded! Although, you still didn't answer my question as to where you came up with Gladriel. While Dear Abby is o.k. it sounds a little old... I think I'll stick with Gladriel!  O.K. enough of the code talk! Mondays are always a busy cleaning day for me. It never ceases to amaze me how two people can totally trash a place over a weekend. We always start out Friday evening with a clean and orderly home, and by Sunday afternoon it looks like a tornado hit!! Crusty pots and pans, paper all over the floor, beds unmade...I suppose it has to do with the fact that I refuse to clean on the weekends. So on Mondays I whirlwind through the house throwing laundry in and out of the washer and cleaning like a maniac. I always stand in the middle of the living room and sigh when I'm done. The world is at peace again, well at least my little slice of the world!  Monday night I had dinner at Bernadette's house with her and Sarah, the other gal in my ladies small group. We had a great time of fellowship over dinner chatting about marriage and our womanly struggles. We're going through the book  Do You Think I'm Beautiful?  and it's bringing up more insecurities than I'd like to admit. It's wonderful to have a safe place to go where other women are working through the same issues. They are all so beautiful!!  Speaking of beautiful, I had a nice chat with Jenn today. Ked and I miss her and Nate like crazy. It's amazing how it can feel like we've known them our whole lives and it's really only been a year and a half. God knew we would all need each other during that past year and a half too. We often wonder what if we hadn't walked into that new church and Nate hadn't been standing there to greet us? Scary! We're all going through some of the same stuff as we are establishing ourselves in new communities and making new friends. A simple phone call makes 1,200 miles feel like 12, that is until I realize I can't get in my car and drive there to see them today. July can't come soon enough.  Sadie has been crazy the past couple days! Ked thought she was bored so he had me buy a bag of her favorite fuzzy shiny balls last weekend. She plays with them constantly! There's half a dozen hidden under the tv and couch and behind the bookcase. She loses them every five minutes and then bugs you to death until you pull them out for her. What a cutie pie! How is it that we can have such a soft spot for our animals?    Well, I'm off to do my Pilates tape. Karon and I have this accountability thing going on. We're going to be new women by the time we see each other in July! And I have to do better this week than I did last week!   for so much more!                "
"                  Oh Happy Day!   Today was a happy day and so I wore my happy outfit! My  happy outfit is bright red, black and pink striped skirt and a bright red shirt. It always makes me happy to wear it because it's a nice lightweight material in fun bright colors that has a very slimming effect on me! So you ask, 'Why was today a happy day?' I'm not really sure! I think it's just the combination of the sunshine, the temperatures warming up, and everything blooming! Last night when we were at the Carr's the air was filled with a beautiful, overwhelming smell of blooms. Dan said it was probably the citrus trees. It was intoxicating! I didn't expect to see a change of seasons down here, but you really do. It's definitely spring and everything is coming alive and blooming.   After church today we packed a couple sandwiches and drove a few miles north to an 11 mile trail on a preserve that we found a couple weeks ago. It was a gorgeous scene through pines and palms, but a mile and half into it, my ankle started to hurt. I told Ked that it felt like my rollerblades were rubbing the skin off my left ankle. I stopped and adjusted them, bladed a little further, stopped again, sat down, took it off, and sure enough a nice layer of skin had rubbed off. OUCH! It was a combination of thin socks and cheap rollerblades. So we turned around and headed back, and I was limping along. (Yes, you can limp on rollerblades!) Ked got behind me and started pushing me. He ended up getting a really good workout! We were almost back to the car and he's huffing, 'well at least you have something to blog about!' Next time I'll have to remember to wear thicker socks.  After all that, we drove home and jumped in the pool to cool off. Despite the debacle with my rollerblades it was a very refreshing afternoon.               "
"                 Friday night we went to our first class for the Public Access TV station.Well, actually it was an orientation. We thought last week was orientation, but apparently that was pre-orientation! We're still not sure what we'll do for a t.v. program, but we're praying about it and starting to toss some ideas around in our heads. It really struck me when the instructor told us that we had a possible audience of 500,000. There's a lot of weight and responsibility there. Ked and I had prayed that we would move to a community that needed some of the Light and that we would be able to impact the community for Christ. We're definitely in an area in desperate need of Light and well, this just could be a medium to do some good with! The station is on the local basic cable on channels 19 and 20, which is awesome to be in the lower numbers - there's a better chance more people will stop on your program. The next class isn't until early May and that will be t.v. graphics. Ked is really excited about that one, naturally. In the meantime we've signed up to help with the Community Desk which means we can get hands on training while helping other producers with various community events such as parades, sports, religious events. We think it will be a great way to get involved in the community and get a feel for this public t.v. thing.  Tonight (Saturday) we went over to the Carrs in Winter Haven. Ked's Grandma and Grandpa have been visiting from Michigan and we made the 45 minute drive to hang out with them. We had a yummy KFC (which is Kitchen Fresh, not Kentucky Fried now!) dinner and a great time visiting with the fam. It's nice to have family close by! It's definitely made the transition easier for us.  One last bit of news. The site Ked did for his Uncle Ben is now live. Please, please, go visit  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com  and tell other people about the site. Pray with us that this will be a tool God will use to generate prayer and financial support for this very special family. The site will give you Ben's story as well as ways that you can get involved including current prayer requests, a link to send a message of encouragement, and how to make a financial donation. Thank you!  Good night (or is it morning!!)               "
"                 Thursdays are always a busy day for me. I spend all morning at the church for a Bible study. It's always enjoyable to worship and fellowship with the women there. I'm enjoying the book my group is going through 'Do You Think I'm Beautiful?' Then in the afternoons I usually go to the grocery store and run various errands. Then by the time I pick up Ked and we make it home we have time to grab a quick bite to eat and head to Life Group. But we didn't make it to Life Group tonight and we were supposed to lead tonight! Oh well. Ked is still feeling sick and he wasn't feeling good at all when he got home from work. He crashed on the couch and I called us in sick.  Anyway, not much to say tonight. My brain is pretty fried. I've spent the last few hours scrapbooking our Alaska pictures and I think I've hit my wall! I'm almost done with them which is absolutely amazing considering there were over 200 pictures to scrapbook! I'm pretty pleased with the album. It's so much fun to scrapbook all these amazing pictures that Ked took and remember what a great time we had. That feels like so long ago...so much has happened since then. That's what scrapbooks are for. To preserve all those memories.  Night y'all               "
"                  I'm back in the saddle!   Today was exhilarating! As Ked and I continue to figure out the processes for  urlLink onPO!NT  Media Group I am becoming more and more involved. It's neat to see how well we complement each other (you look so great, oh and so do you!). Where one of us is weak, the other is strong. So we are learning to maximize those strengths and minimize our weaknesses as we develop this business. Ked is turning over project management to me and I couldn't be more thrilled!! I spent the morning responding to e-mails and calling a couple clients, making some text changes and e-mailing files. It felt sooo good. This is an area where I THRIVE! I love managing projects and working through the details. I'm learning more about the software Ked uses and I'm getting pretty good at making the changes a client requests after Ked sends the initial design. It's good to be back.  After dinner we realized it's St Patrick's Day today, and we hadn't had a Shamrock Shake yet from McDonald's!! Oh nooo!!! It's tradition!! So we drove through the drive through at McDonald's for a Shamrock Shake, and it was yummy! Of course we always get a medium and every time remind ourselves that a small is plenty! Ked posted a picture of our yummy pleasure over at  urlLink What's the Po!nt?   ahhh....and as we were headed to McDonald's we saw a huge orange fireball setting into the horizon. It was gorgeous. Wish you were here.               "
"                  Phase 2   So I'm feeling a little thoughtful today. I suppose that's what happens when I spend a couple days by myself and it's raining.  Ked and I are at a new place in our life, and I don't just mean our move to Florida. For the past six and a half years, it's like we've been moving through Phase 1. We grew into adulthood together, developed an unbelievably sound marriage relationship, worked through bitterness toward God and church, and learned to love and experience God 'outside the box.' We discovered and honed the skills for our career paths, finished our degrees, and searched our hearts for what role ministry would play in our lives. Through it all, we were searching, searching, searching. What plan does God have for our lives? What if we miss it? We've often been told what a dynamic team we are, and that haunted us. We don't want to be viewed, especially by God, as people who have so much potential. We want to LIVE to our fullest potential. At times we felt as if God was hiding, or maybe our faith wasn't big enough, or sometimes that He just wasn't listening. We prayed, we cried, we vented, and always searched to know God's plan, His truth and His wisdom.  And then all the sudden, it happened. Phase 1 closed with a bang. We graduated, took a missions trip and fulfilled a three year dream to move here. It was a time that was so big, only God could have done it.  As we transitioned into Phase 2 we learned how weak our faith was. Along the way the questions continued to haunt us, but slowly, we continued to grow and God began to answer. Dreams started to be fulfilled, and God continued to give us glimpses of Him. It's amazing. It's scary. The responsibility sometimes frightens me. But the fears began to wash away and the tide dropped peace onto the shore.   Today as I was thinking through all of this again, I hopped onto the website of our friends at  urlLink RBC Ministries.  The reading for  urlLink today's Daily Bread  confirmed what I have begun to realize. God doesn't hide from those who truly seek Him. They quoted from  urlLink Proverbs 2:1-6   3 if you call out for insight  and cry aloud for understanding,  4 and if you look for it as for silver  and search for it as for hidden treasure,  5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD  and find the knowledge of God.  6 For the LORD gives wisdom,  and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.   We've been crying, even pleading. God WANTS to give understanding and knowledge of Him and His plan for us. He doesn't play games. It will come with time, and there’s no rush. I’ve come to realize it will take my whole life to figure out all that God has in store, and for once I’m just enjoying the journey as He reveals a little bit more each day. It’s a nice place to be.                "
"                  All the Things I Hate   Today I got to do all the things I hate! At least I got them all out of the way on a Monday so I can enjoy the rest of the week! I've got this weird paranoia about Dr. offices, hospitals, needles and x-rays, and today I got to go to the Doctor AND get my blood drawn (all just routine stuff). I have no idea how, when or why my paranoia began, but I remember almost passing out during x-rays in the 6th grade. Then in high school I DID pass out after some shots. I remember telling the nurse I felt queasy and next thing I knew I was staring at Barney on the ceiling. If you ever want to get  me worse than running your fingers on a chalkboard, just tell me about your recent ailment. Be warned though, I might throw up! Whenever I go to a hospital or nursing home to visit someone as I approach the parking lot, my chest starts to tighten. I have to take slow, deep breaths to slow my heart down and control that nauseous knot in my stomach. So this afternoon I went through the whole routine as I pulled into the parking lot and sat in the waiting room. THEN she said she was going to draw some blood. I've learned to just flat out tell them I'm a sissy and that I should lay down. They're always quite happy to oblige since they don't want to have to pick me up off the floor! When I picked Ked up from work this afternoon, I proudly showed off the cotton ball taped to my arm...'and I didn't even pass out!!'                 "
"                  We like it hot, hot, hot!!   ahhh! What a beautiful day! Unfortunately, Ked woke up feeling rather yucky. I think he has what I had a couple weeks ago. That and there's enough pollen in the air down here to make everyone sneeze and sniffle.  We had a wonderful visit catching up with my Great Aunt Jean and Uncle Lowell over lunch. They spend their winters not far from here. They treated us to lunch at Chili's, and we enjoyed getting to know them better. It's always fun to talk to people who knew your parents as kids and babysat them. They told some good stories about my Mom that we'd never heard before! Like shoplifting a candy bar? And cutting Uncle Lowell's hair? We're planning to visit them again at their place before they head north in a month.  As we were driving home we got a voicemail from Ked's Dad asking if we had gotten snow like they had this morning. Ked smirked and rolled the windows all the way down for our ride home! In further defiance of the cold and misery of March that our fine friends of the north are facing, we decided to walk down the street for an ice cream treat! There's nothing quite so nice as a stroll in the sun with a nice breeze and one hand in your best friend's hand and the other wrapped around ice cream.               "
"                 I love Saturdays! Ked worked on some freelance jobs off and on all day long, and I just hung around. I have these days every now and then when I'm restless. Nothing sounds interesting to do and so I flit from activity to activity not really accomplishing anything nor having the mental focus to accomplish anything if I tried. Today was one of those days!  Jason called last night and it was good to catch up with him. Ked and I continually count our blessings when it comes to our siblings and their other halves. It's one thing to have good relationships with all our siblings. It's quite another thing to consider them  great friends  and people we want to hang out with and live our lives with. We are truly blessed.  Speaking of blessed with good friendships, the Falcon has given me the code name of Gladriel on his blog (nxgnn8). He says we should all understand where our code names came from, but this is a complete mystery to me. The thought of being a tall, slender, blonde elf is quite appealing though! Or maybe he chose it realizing what a graceful and qualified leader I am. HA!! Anywho, we are continually thankful for the friendship there, as well as with all our friends across the country. It's most delightful to look over the map of our lives and recognize that were it not for a pitt stop or a detour here and there we might not have some of the most precious friendships in our lives. It may be through a chance meeting (like Chancel camp freshman year at CU, I miss you Jennifer!), or through the friendship of our parents and their common hobbies (where are you Karen, I miss you too!), or a lifetime bond begun in kindergarten Sunday School (I can't wait to see you in July, Shelley!), but there is no doubt that the golden threads of friendship woven into my life enrich the beauty of life on this earth. No matter the time and distance that separates us, you are precious gems.  In blogging news, Ked helped me add a comments section to my blog! You can now post a reply, comment or thought to my posts! So, we are still looking for ideas for a tv show to produce for Public Access (see my previous post). If you have any suggestions, post a reply! Ked's coworker Brian thought we could do a David Blaine spoof. With Ked growing his hair out long, Brian says Ked looks like a magician and thought we could go around the University campus and do magic tricks. Oh my.               "
"                  In a Fog   I was pretty tired yesterday and felt like my head was in a fog all day!! So I indulged myself with a couple hundred pages of a novel that I borrowed from Karon. I was jealous of her reading and realized it had been quite awhile since I had read one.  Ked and I did something interesting last night. We went with his coworker Brian to an orientation for our local Public Access television station. We go back next week and will probably take a 12 week course which will certify us to produce our own show. We really don't have any idea what we would do with it yet. It sounded like something fun and with as creative as we try to be we thought it might be a cool adventure. So if you have any ideas of what kind of show we should do, e-mail me!!  Hollywood here we come!               "
"                  And That's Why They Call it the Blues   I am sad to report that the Adventures of the Tropical Sister Chicks ended today. We dropped Ked off at work and then Karon and I headed to McDonald's for breakfast (shhh!! Don't tell Ked --that's twice we went without him!). After we finished eating it was about 9:15 and she needed to be at the airport at 9:30. She didn't have any trouble checking in and called us when she got to Grand Rapids. Her flight was smooth and fortunately it wasn't horribly cold when she arrived! We miss her terribly already! We had such a great time with her and I really enjoyed having company during the day.  And thus began my blues. After I dropped her off reality set in that my vacation was over too, and I was back to my routine of being alone all day. Now don't get me wrong, it's not too often that I get bored. It took me awhile to adjust from working full time and being in school full time to staying at home and helping Ked with onPO!NT Media Group, but I did eventually get into a routine. Unfortunately, it's not very exciting and a lot of my human contact day in and day out is over e-mail, instant messaging, and a few phone calls. It's just not near as exciting as laying next to Karon on a beach and giggling over sea gulls stealing her food or just giggling for no reason other than it's 80 degrees and beautiful. I realized how much I was going to miss that company of having someone around during the day and that lump in my throat wouldn't go away.  So before I headed home I decided to give myself therapy and I headed to JoAnn's etc. Ked had asked me to pick up a couple pieces of foam board that were on sale, and well you know I had to browse. And there just so happened to be a big rack of clearance scrapbooking paper and so I picked up a few sheets and felt better about myself and my life.  After I picked up Ked from work I shared my blues with him and he had me feeling better in no time. He showed me how to use my new Adobe Photoshop Elements software to create an online photo album and now I think I'm the coolest thing since sliced bread. (And now you're thinking, what a looney on a rollercoaster today!!!) Anyway, I'm like super duper excited about this photo album, so humor me and click  urlLink here , or under photos on the menu to your right, no your other right! Click on Tropical Sister Chicks and check out pictures from all the adventures you've read about! You can click on a picture and it will show you a bigger one and you can flip through them that way. Don't you just love the coconuts??                 "
"                  In for the home stretch   Yesterday and today were another couple of great days as we rounded the home stretch of Karon's trip. Yesterday she and I did the morning routine of dropping off Ked and then we headed to Sarasota to see Grandma Louise and hit the shops and beach of Venice. We visited with Grandma for a little while and she showed off her new digs to Karon. Grandma is the shell queen and she lives in castle of shells. Those of you who know her know what I mean! Grandma has picked up shells on the Gulf coast of Florida for over 20 years and she has a collection that belongs in the Guiness Book of World Records! Karon has had quite a blast picking up shells over the past week and she was in awe of Grandma's collection. Karon was wondering what all she could do with her shells once she got home and now she has plenty of ideas!! Karon has told me a couple times she doesn't understand why I don't go to the beach every day because she sure would if she lived here!  Grandma drove us down to Venice and we toured the shops on the cool little strip. I took Karon to our family's all time favorite - Sea Pleasures and Treasures. We spent quite a bit of time in there and Karon found some real winning treasures. You can never go wrong in that store. You want cool jewelry? Want to make your own jewelry out of your finds? They have it all. Karon also found an awesome turtle necklace that she says I made her buy, but I promise I didn't!! She thought it was cool and didn't know if she had anything to wear it with and so I suggested she try it on. It just so happened to look awesome with the shirt she was wearing!!  After the shops we hit Casperson Beach, another one of my all time favorites and Grandma's second home. Or maybe the beach is really her home and her home is her second home. Hmmm. Grandma has three shoe boxes full of shark's teeth that she's picked up at Casperson over the years. Yesterday wasn't a good day to find teeth though. The wind was really blowing again and the waves were moving too quickly to find anything. We did sift through quite a few shells and Karon found some good ones that we hadn't found at Fort DeSoto, and we did find two little shark's teeth that Karon can put in her scrapbook.  We only stayed at the beach a little while and even though we rolled them up above our knees, I still managed to get my jeans soaked! Brrr!! It was cold! It's been funny to hear Karon talk about how it's been chilly the past few days. Before she came to visit she thought I was crazy when I would tell her that 65 felt cold. But after being spoiled in the 80's for a few days last week she understands what I mean now!! We ate a late lunch at Grandma's and visited some more before heading back to pick up Ked. For supper we treated Karon to some awesome pizza at Buca DiBeppo's and raced home to watch the Wild Card episode of American Idol!  Today we kind of wound things down and tied up loose ends. We dropped Ked off at work and headed to Wal-Mart for a few things and Karon got her two rolls of film developed and then found a book at Borders to read on the flight home.  We then headed to Rosemary Tea Cottage for tea at 11:30. This is a great little spot that my friend April told me about when we first moved here. I took Ked's Mom there in November and we had a blast! They serve the yummiest sandwiches and scones and today topped it off with a moist peanut butter brownie and lemon sorbet. We had a wonderful time just chatting and relaxing as we recapped our trip and talked about dreams for the future and where we feel God leading us over the next couple years. It was a wonderful, refreshing time.   Next we headed back to our apartment and Karon packed up and we made cd's of the pictures off our digital camera and I copied the cd's of the pictures she just developed and we washed her shells and bleached the sand dollars and just had a good time getting her ready to go home. After Ked got home we were all so tired we just kind of hung around, Ked finished a few projects, and we watched the verdict of last night's American Idol. We all hit the hay early tonight. Except for me. Why am I still up? Oh yeah, because I'm addicted to blogging and I didn't want to let all two of my regular readers down!!! =)  Good night all. This Tropical Sister Chicks asleep already!               "
"                  The adventures of Tropical Sister Chicks and da brother   Well, well. Where do I begin? What an awesome weekend!  Friday -  A Spa Treatment, A Writing Victory & Concert #1  Karon and I dropped Ked off at work on Friday and headed back to Fort DeSoto for another day at the beach. As we were walking toward the beach an older gentleman wearing a ballcap sitting at a picnic table waved at us. I did a double take as I realized a squirrel was sitting on his head eating the corn the gentleman was setting on the bill of his hat! It turned out to be a very windy day and Karon decided it would be fun to ride the waves. The water was so cold it felt like a tub full of ice! The waves made it hard to find many sand dollars. We found a couple then headed back to our towels. The wind was blowing the sand and it wasn't long before we were covered head to toe in a thin layer of sand. All we needed to do was scrub in some water and we had a full body spa exfoliating treatment! Karon managed to eat all of her sandwich too. There were a couple birds hovering over us while we ate, but I kept flailing my arms and yelling at them calling them all sorts of names. Finally they flew away and I was sure I heard one of them squawk 'stupid tourists!' We didn't stay at the beach long and headed back to the apartment and jumped in the pool to get rid of that gritty feeling.  That afternoon I was under pressure to finish a project for Ked. He needed content for a website he is doing for his Uncle Ben. Ben was diagnosed with a brain tumor several years ago. If you haven't been reading Ked's blog, check out his entry for  urlLink February 17 , he sums this project up well. It's been a tough one for us to work on because it is so personal and painful. Ked had asked me to work up some text for the site and I wrestled with it for weeks. Friday was the deadline and I knew Ked wanted it Saturday morning. I took a shower after Karon and I went swimming and I was praying asking God for help. I had no idea what to say or how to present Ben's story. Suddenly, the words just started flowing. I jumped out of the shower, dressed and headed straight to my computer. Fifteen minutes later what I had been wrestling with for several weeks was on the screen. I was so thankful and knew that God had helped me. As I relayed the story to Ked over dinner he said, 'Now you're starting to sound like a professional writer. You just had your first story come to you in the shower!' Keep your eyes on  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com . The site should be up in the next week. Ben and his family are very dear to us, and they could use your prayers.  Friday night ended with Ked and I going to the Linkin Park P.O.D. concert. We had a great time and came home with raspy voices. Karon insisted that she did not want to go and spent the evening at our place with Sadie and some good movies.   Saturday - Concert #2  Saturday we spent the morning tying up some responsibilities around the house. Karon and I headed to JoAnn's etc. to fuel our obsession of scrapbooking. They were having a BIG sale and Karon found some great stickers for all the pictures she's taken while down here.  We headed over to Winter Haven to pick up Kristen for the  urlLink See Spot Rock  concert in Orlando. We had a couple hours to hang out with the family and Karon, Ked, Kristen, Uncle Dan, Molly and I played a short round of RISK. None of us really knew what we were doing at first, but it was a lot of fun! Paul and Molly begged us to come back next week and play again, but they said we can't come until next Saturday. They're grounded from RISK until then. Apparently after we left for the concert a nuclear explosion happened and game pieces were all over the house in a Paul/Molly explosion!  We had an absolute BLAST at the concert at the Last Wave Club. The club is a ministry that was started as a safe and fun place for teens to hang out in the Orlando area and as an alternative to the secular club scene. Before heading in, we three girls used some of Karon's red hair paste gave ourselves some red streaks and glittered our faces. Ked had these glow sticks and we each put one in our mouths and it was so cool because the club was dark and we were glowing. People kept asking us if it was our gum and where we had gotten them. After a while though they started to taste funny and we realized they were leaking! So we threw them out. But Ked's actually exploded in his mouth and it was really funny because his mouth was all speckled and glowing!! The club was packed and it wasn't long before it was hot and sweaty. Our favorites of the evening were  urlLink GRITS , Pillar, and Skillet. Karon and I had seen Skillet in concert last year and WOW have they changed up their sound! Their new album is incredible and they sound so much bigger and better! We didn't care as much for 12 Stones. The other three bands were purposeful in their testimony and music without being preachy. 12 Stones had a lead singer who was sometimes just plain strange and there wasn't much point really to their performance other than to just sing. During the show there was a group of Jr. High boys that had way too much testosterone and they decided to mosh. We got quite the kick out of watching Ked throw elbows every time they came too close to 'his girls'! Afterwards we got to meet and have our pictures taken with GRITS, Skillet and Pillar. All those guys and gals were just so awesome. They were friendly and personable and I  just can't describe how cool they were. It was an awesome evening and once again we had scratchy voices!! We headed back to the Carrs place and got a few hours sleep before getting up and heading to Sea World!!   Sunday - dolphins, Sting Rays, and Whales, Oh my!  Sunday we headed to Sea World Orlando. It had been at least 20 years since I had been to a Sea World and over 10 since Karon and Ked had been. We had such a great time! The weather was beautiful, but we still decided to avoid the splash zones at the shows. We loved seeing the dolphins and killer whales show off their skills and interact with the trainers. What a rush that has to be for them to be launched in the air by a killer whale! We got to pet some dolphins and sting rays and get a peek at some adorable baby dolphins. The sea otter show was hilarious! Those animals are so much fun! And we also enjoyed the Pets Ahoy show where they train various animals from a rat to cats, dogs, geese, and a pig that they rescue from shelters. I would love to know how they trained those cats. We can't get Sadie to do anything! We left the park not long before they closed and headed over towards Downtown Disney. We had some great Chicago style pizza at Pizzeria Uno and then walked the shops at Downtown Disney. That place was CRAZY shoulder to shoulder people! Spring Break is definitely in session! Karon and I hit, can you believe it, the scrapbook shop!! She picked up some cute Mickey shaped eyelets and some Disney stickers. We then walked through a couple more shops where you can find just about anything with a Disney label and theme that you could ever imagine. Finally we headed to our hotel with aching feet and burning eyes. We caught a few hours sleep before getting up early and heading to meet Uncle Dan at Disney World on Monday!   Monday - Lions, Tigers and Winne the Pooh, Oh my!  We met Uncle Dan at the entrance to the Animal Kingdom bright and early at 8 a.m. sharp! He let us in the gate and suggested that we go on the safari first thing. He walked us back and rode the safari with us. Uncle Dan is hilarious and we love hearing him tell us the inside stuff at Disney. We'd be riding along and the safari guy driving the bus would excitedly shout 'look at those ostrich eggs!' We'd look and Dan would smirk. I'd ask 'hmm...I bet those eggs have taken three years to hatch!' Disney is quite amazing at putting together an experience. Yes, the animals are live, but those termite hills that are as hard as concrete that the animals scratch their heads on really are as hard as concrete because...um, they are concrete!! After the safari Dan said adios and we headed out exploring more of the Kingdom. We did all we could do in Animal Kingdom then headed to MGM for screams and thrills on the Tower of Terror and Rock'n RollerCoaster. I love those 2 rides. Tower of Terror is my favorite because they have like 12 variations so it's different every time. It's just so cool to not know when you're going to drop or how many times. I'm not sure what's more thrilling -- the suspense of when you're going to drop or the actual drop!! Then we headed to the madness of the Magic Kingdom and finished out the day there. We decided not to stay for the fireworks and left a little early to save $20 and catch dinner outside the park. Our feet were aching and our eyes burning, but we were exhausted and happy. What a fun weekend! It was a blast to share all that fun with Karon. She's so cool and a riot to hang out with. Sometimes we get to laughing until we cry. It's so cool because we're all friends and we've been friends for so long and have shared so many memories. I guess that's the cool thing about knowing your husband's family for sooo long. I feel like I've been part of the family forever (I mean we're going on 10 years of being together). Thanks!!  So, Friday was Kurt and Ken's birthdays. We tried to send out a Happy Birthday Yo, but we didn't catch either of them. I guess the siblings don't matter as much now that they have the ladies. =) We left messages to let them know we were thinking of them. Then the Mama's birthday was Saturday, and we did catch her to send a Happy Birthday song. Hope you all had great birthdays! We were thinking of you as we sung our lungs out at our concerts.  Well, I'm sure I missed some of the details, but you're probably tired of reading by now, and I really need to go to bed. Karon and I have one last day of fun planned before she heads back!! Maybe I'll post a picture tomorrow, but for now Ked posted one at   urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com/blog . Tropical Sister out!               "
"                 Wow!! What a fun, extended weekend! We had an absolute blast at our concerts on Friday and Saturday and then Sea World on Sunday and Disney today!! Whew! We had all the fun our feet could take! And some very cool pictures! Unfortunately, you will have to wait one more day to hear about it because I'm whipped and going to bed! Just wanted to let you all know it was great and I'll share our stories with you tomorrow!  Sleepy but Happy Ameliou!!               "
"                  To Be Continued...   Just a quick note to let you know I'll be away for a few days....I'll have to catch you up on yesterday because it was one of the best Fridays ever!! We are walking out the door right now to head towards Orlando. We're picking up Kristen and then heading to See Spot Rock with Skillet, 12 Stones, Pillar, Grits and Big Dismal!! Then it's on to Sea World tomorrow and Disney on Monday! It's going to be an AWESOME weekend!! Rock on!               "
"                  Today was for the birds!   Literally!  Tropical Sister Chicks Day 3.  Karon and I headed out to Clearwater beach for another day of sand and surf. We arrived at the beach at 9:30 a.m. and decided to hit the tourist shops while waiting for the sun to warm up. After browsing through rows of alligator heads, sharks in a jar, and shark tooth necklaces we headed for the beach. By this time it was getting close to 11 a.m. and we decided we were hungry. So, after we staked our claim of beach for the day we pulled out our packed sandwiches. Karon took two bites of her sandwich and was raising her sandwich to her mouth for another bite and we heard this SQUAWK, SQUAWK, SWOOSH, and a scream!!! Next thing I see is turkey flying to the left, a piece of bread flying to the right, and a very brave seagull flying away with Karon's sandwich!! This CRAZY bird flew in from behind her right over her shoulder and in one smooth swoop stole her sandwich right from her hands!! Karon is sitting there with her empty hands in position to take a bite from her sandwich and we just started laughing our heads off!!! Within milliseconds a swarm of seagulls had snatched up the rest of the sandwich. Everyone at the beach was staring at us! Not long after that we saw the seagulls perform their sting again, only this time the sandwich hadn't even made it out of the plastic bag!!   A little later we headed to the concession stand so Karon could get some lunch! We think that it might be a secret operation where the concession people teach the seagulls to steal people's food so that they have to buy from their stand. Anyway, Karon finally has another sandwich in hand and she heads to the condiment stand to put some mayo on her sandwich. They had the mayo, ketchup and mustard in these fountains like what bars use to dispense beer. She pulls on the handle and this runny mayo EXPLODES all over her shirt and the wall! Again, we just busted up laughing. This was not her day to eat!! As if that wasn't enough after we finished eating we headed back to our stake of the beach and a bird had pooped on our blanket, right where Karon's head had been laying!! It was hilariously insane! So we decided that tomorrow we will head back to Fort DeSoto where the birds don't steal your sandwich.  Bronzed Tropical Sister Chick out!!               "
"                  Everything's Just Beachy    Tropical Sister Chicks Day 2!!  This morning Karon and I dropped Ked off at work and with picnic lunches and sunscreen in tow we headed for the beach! We went to Fort DeSoto beach rated by someone nicknamed 'Mr. Beach' as the 2nd best beach in the U.S. for 2003 right behind a beach in Hawaii. It was a beautiful day in the low 80's with the perfect mix of sunshine, clouds, and light breeze. The beach was sandy white and well maintained. The water was chilly at first, feeling like Lake Michigan in July. We arrived around 10 a.m. and had the beach mostly to ourselves. By noon the area had started to fill up but was far from crowded. We started to walk the beach and in addition to seeing a tiny 1/2 inch crab we saw various shells and lots of sand dollar pieces. I said to Karon, I bet if we walk out there a little we'd find whole sand dollars. Not long after that we saw a lady walking with a handful of sand dollars and she said people were finding them out where I thought we would. So Karon and I waded out about thigh deep and started walking. We ended up getting totally drenched thanks to the waves and bending over to pickup our treasures. We walked away with 15 very cool sand dollars and some of the largest shells I've ever picked up on a beach. I found one sweet shell and was all excited until I pulled it out of the water and realized it was still alive!! Some black squishy mussel was opening and closing his mouth in protest to being picked up. I tossed him back. We had a great time relaxing and enjoying the great outdoors.  We came home after picking up Ked and decided to finish what we started last night. Karon added a few more blonde chunks to her hair and then Amelia got her blonde highlights. So much sun & fun!!  Tomorrow we're going to check out another beach!!               "
"                  Tropical Sister Chicks!   Today began the tropical adventure of two sister-in-laws who are more like sisters. The weather was good to Karon today and she had a great flight in and even arrived early!! Ked and I picked her up and the warm 80 degree weather greeted her as she walked out of the airport. She and Ked stood watching the baggage carousel go round and round few times before Karon recognized her suitcase. The suitcase was upside down and she didn't recognize the backside of it! Thus began a day full of chatter and laughs. The sister chicks dropped Ked off at work and headed out to see what the day might hold. Since we had to pick Ked up again in a few hours we decided to stay in town. We began to plot our week of adventure. And we started out as we quite often do with a change of hair color!! After searching Target and Wal-Mart for just the right shades we were armed to begin our adventures in style. We were laughing as we discussed all our hair escapades. 'Now was that the time you went for blonde and red chunks, or was that the subtle blonde time?' After dinner we started with Karon. I pulled her hair through the cap while we watched American Idol and discussed who was out of tune and whether or not we agreed with Simon's comments. Karon decided on blonde and red highlights. We only made it through the blonde highlights tonight. Her red highlights and Amelia's blonde highlights will have to wait until tomorrow night. By 10:30 we were all pretty tired. We packed lunches for tomorrow and grabbed a stash of magazines and books to take with us to the beach tomorrow. It will be another fun day!!  So now I must head to bed as I am tired and my fingers aren't finfing the rigjt keuyrs. Yeah. I had like four hours sleep last night, partly because I was really excited for Karon to come today and partly because I just have sleep issues. I'm a night owl and my body is just wired differently. So often I lay in bed for HOURS before I fall asleep. Last night the last time I looked at the clock it was 1:30 a.m. and I still wasn't tired. So I decided I'd tough it out today and force myself to be really tired tonight, and I think it worked!!  Tropical Sister Chick out!               "
"                 The weekend was pretty uneventful, except for Ked's episode washing the car. If you haven't read it, check it out at  urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com/blog . It's hilarious!! I slept a lot in an attempt to kick this cold that's been haunting me for a week.  Every now and then we look back on our decision to move here and have a fleeting thought of wondering if we did the right thing. Ked had been super stressed at his previous job. He was so overworked and underpaid. Now everyone says that they're overworked and underpaid, but in Ked's case he knew he was doing the work of three people. Daily he faced the sinking feeling of knowing there was more work than he could ever possibly get done. When he left we were curious to see what they would do to replace him. Just last week we heard that in fact, they are hiring their THIRD full time employee to replace him. Yes, we were right. He was doing the work of three people. They hired a graphic designer, a web programmer, and now are hiring a web manager who will handle the design aspects. We just laughed. It's self-gratifying to know it really did take three people to replace him.  Today was a beautiful day. When Ked got home from work we hit the trail for a 2 mile jog/walk. It was cloudy and breezy and the perfect temperature to sweat a little but not overheat. Our senses were confronted with the smell of freshly cut grass bringing back all the nostalgia of spring. Along the way we saw a few trees and bushes just starting to bloom again. The birds were gathering and chirping in full force. I think they were making their travel arrangements to head back north. I love seeing everything come alive in the spring.  It's going to be a busy and fun week with Karon arriving tomorrow! I'll keep you posted on our adventures.                "
"                  Singin in the Rain!   It's been a busy couple of days! I was commenting to Ked on Wednesday night how sometimes I feel like I live in Florida, but I don't live in Florida. How's that for confusing?? What I  mean is day in and day out 99% of the people I communicate with are in Ohio and Michigan. It's a wonderful thing that technology enables me to stay in touch with our family, friends, and clients back north. But sometimes I feel like I don't have much of a life here in Florida other than on Thursdays and Sundays.  As if in a direct answer to my discussion on Wednesday night, Thursday was awesome. I had my ladies Bible study in the morning. I had missed two weeks and didn't realize how much I had missed it until we were worshipping together. After Bible study I was invited to a lunch meeting to help plan some upcoming women's events for the church. I was sitting around the table with some incredible, Godly women and I just breathed a prayer of thanks. I felt so connected and so in Florida.  Speaking of the great women around that table, one is the wife of one of our pastors and I just love being around her, because every time she opens her mouth unbelievable wisdom comes out. She and her husband are the elders's elders, not just because of their age, but because they have so much experience, grace, and wisdom. I hope when I'm her age that I'm as graceful and wise as she is. In the few times I've been around her I've gleaned so much just by listening to her.   After Bible study and the meeting I came home and whipped up a salad for our Life Group social. We had a great time hanging out at a potluck at one couple's apartment. We call ourselves the 'junk food' lifegroup because every week have some form of chocolate, pizza, chips, or candy (some weeks all of the above!). We're not too big on the fruits and vegetables - although last night we did have my salad and a veggie tray, along with two forms of brownies and a bowl of Skittles. Actually, I think everyone eats pretty well the rest of the week and we all just decided that Thursdays nights is the time to cut loose, or something! We have two new couples in the group and it was great to get to know them better. We played several rounds of 'catch phrase' and just had a blast.  Today I took Ked into work and did some serious shopping. I had a $10 coupon to Famous Footwear that was about to expire, and I decided to use it to buy shoes for Shelley's wedding. I like shoe shopping; it's so much fun to try on new shoes and imagine what they'll look like with various outfits. Anyway, I found the perfect pair for the wedding - they are cute and comfortable! Such an unlikely match! After the victory there I headed to Target and scored a couple cool T-shirts for $4 each. Gotta love that! Then I headed to JoAnn's to use my 40% off coupon to pick up a scrapbook to put all my pages in I've been finishing lately. The funny thing is I actually had a dream about JoAnn's last night. I was in the store with someone (I don't remember who) and I was droning on and on about how awesome it was to have a JoAnn's etc. in town and how sweet it is that JoAnn's now has their own line of scrapbook products. What a nerd, I even dream about JoAnn's! That's scary. Anyway, I made it home with everything on the list and didn't pay full retail price for a single item! That's a good day.  Then tonight Ked and I had another great Tampa experience. I discovered that the city has a free Friday concert series through the end of May in a city park. I packed a dinner and surprised Ked with the news when I picked him up. We got this really cool picnic set for Christmas from Aunt Nancy and Uncle Alan, and we put it to good use tonight. We arrived at the park at 5:30 and set up our picnic table with the table cloth and had a great relaxing dinner together enjoying the music that was playing while the crews set up. We put our dinner stuff back in the car and Ked grabbed a book and I grabbed a newspaper (vital to the upcoming story) and we sat in our camp chairs waiting for the concert to start. The crowd started to gather and so did the rain clouds overhead. There were two local bands on the lineup tonight - Blues and light rock 60's era style. The first band was a lot of fun. I love watching the little boys and the little old ladies in the audience get their groove on. The rest of us can only hope to be as cool as them. About a half hour into the concert, the clouds started to spit on us. We all thought for sure it would blow over and the band kept playing. Most people whipped out their umbrellas, and I put the newspaper on my head because SOMEONE left our cool big umbrella at work! =) After about ten minutes it started to downpour and they called the concert off. Half the fun really was getting rained out and drenched as we raced to our car. We were laughing and giggling the whole way home. It was such a fun evening and so much better than sitting at home or in a movie theater. They announced that they'll bring these two bands back in early June. We think we'll check them out again then.               "
"                 If you haven't checked out the comments posted on my April 26 blog, please do so. My Uncle John wrote a beautiful note that day. Also big congratulations to my cousin on the birth of his baby! He is absolutely adorable!!  This week has been rather uneventful around here. Last night I was scrapbooking away (still working on catching up last year's photos) and suddenly I think to myself, 'I bet it's REALLY late!' I got up to check the clock and it was 3 am!! I decided if I wanted to get anything done the next day I should head to bed! I was surprised when I got up at 10 am today and was awake!!  I made a scrapbooker's resolution at the start of the new year. I decided I wouldn't buy any new paper until I had used up what I already have. For those of you who have seen my paper collection, you know that's quite a feat!! Most scrapbookers have 2 hobbies - scrapbooking and collecting scrapbooking supplies, and for me - paper is my thing. I've always loved paper, which is why I think I took to scrapbooking like a fish to water. Whenever fall came I would go through the stores and smell the school supplies. There's nothing like a fresh notebook - it holds so much potential!! I feel the same way when I sort through my scrapbook paper - there's so much potential!! I've enjoyed using up my supply of paper and have gotten quite creative in using up my scraps as well. I need to buy a new blender (I broke my last one, it fell out of the cabinet) and start making handmade paper out of my scraps.  Well, no 3 am stunts tonight! I have Bible study in the morning! Amelia out!!  (oh, that reminds me, George Huff survived another week on A.I. which I was so excited about since I couldn't get through to vote last night!! whew!!)               "

Robertson - you need to get a comments section on your blog! I've got lots of thoughts about faith! 3. Kederoni - 24 Rocks!! 4. Mom P. - it's really weird to think of you as a  great  aunt. You're too young!! 5. Falcon - talkin 'bout snow on April 27 isn't a convincing argument to move back! 6. D.Q. (please pass it along, falcon!) - I appreciate your friendship and wish you were closer! Why'd you move so far away?? =) 7. Little bigger brother - I miss you...where are you?? You didn't call.... 8. My Washington Pal - it was so good to hear from you! I think you need to take a Florida vacation. 9. Kurdled Spilk - do we have a rock sighting yet? 10. K v.2.0 - So when are you and the lady gonna come see us? Pack up the blazer and head on down! She needs a vacation after fighting CU for 4 years!  Not much going on today. I spent quite awhile on the phone and the internet researching some stuff. I got a call today about my student loans and looks like I'm eligible to consolidate which is great news. I don't have much debt, but this will help us pay it off even faster. It was pretty cool! Oh and I made a new recipe today - Boston Baked Beans. They cooked all day and turned out pretty good! I've never made baked beans from scratch before. Anyway...  Well I need to go vote for American Idol. After the disaster of last week with Jennifer Hudson getting voted off, I need to make sure I get my votes in this week!!  ok bbye!               "
"                  Dear Aunt Jan,   I can't believe it's been a year since your smile faded into eternity. It seems like I haven't talked to you on the phone in awhile, until I realize that you wouldn't be there to answer if I called. You would probably be surprised at how often your name has come up in conversation over the past year. Little things here and there continue to remind me of you. It seems just like yesterday I was five years old twirling in Grandma's kitchen showing off my new Easter dress to you. You told 'the boys' to treat me nicely because I was a princess. In the blink of an eye, I was in elementary school and you bought me my first cross stitch kit. I was never as good as you were; your pieces were works of art. When I was learning how to sew in junior high, you once told me that a professional seamstress always pays close attention to the finishing of a garment making sure there are no threads hanging. I always think of you whenever I clip the threads on a recently finished project. You were the model of a graceful hostess and one of the warmest and kindest women I've ever known. I miss you terribly, but I'm thankful you are no longer in pain. Jesus has finally healed you.   I heard that your first grandchild was born today. I smiled and thought to myself that it's just like God to bring such a joy to your family on a day of grieving. I'm sure if God allowed, you sent kisses to baby John from heaven.  I miss you. Love, Amelia  Amelia's High School Graduation                  "
"                  Cherished Friends   We had a wonderful time hanging out with Dennis, Hilary and Grant this weekend! We first met them four years ago while in a small group at Ada Bible Church. The four of us hit it off right away and did a lot of life together until they moved to northern Michigan about a year and a half ago. They even drove down (3 hours) to help us pack up when we moved to Florida. We've missed hanging out with them and it was so good to reconnect. They're the kind of people you can pick right up with as if no time has passed.  We headed over to Kissimmee Wednesday evening and spent the night at the beautiful 6 bedroom house Dennis, Hilary and her parents had rented for their vacation. Early Thursday we headed to Disney World and met up with Uncle Dan who let us in! I had forgotten that Dennis and Hilary had met Dan's wife Beth along with Paul, Molly and Kristen just a few days before Grant was born. Hilary mentioned that to Dan and I reminded her that Paul had sat right next to her at lunch that day and prepared her for having a boy. He had chatted away, and I think he even burped in her ear! It was so funny!  We spent most of the day at MGM Studios. Ked and Dennis rode the Rockin' Rollercoaster 3 times (twice in a row). Hilary and I sat the last 2 out and rested on a bench. We had just eaten and decided we didn't want to see our lunch again. Ked and Dennis were like little boys all day long. It was all Hilary and I could do to keep up with them as they raced from one ride to the next! Our feet were so tired by the end of the day! After we did all we wanted at MGM we headed to the Magic Kingdom to catch a few favorite rides and then ended the day at Epcot with dinner and a walk around the nations. We headed back to the house around 10 pm and soaked our feet in the hot tub before heading to bed. We all slept so good that night!!  Friday we slept in and then decided to head to the east coast for the day. We were going to check out the Kennedy Space Center but later decided that might not be such a great idea with a two year old. Instead we headed down to Cocoa Beach to catch some rays, which there were plenty of on this steamy 90 degree day! The beach itself wasn't much to speak of. Ked called it the burn out beach, where everyone has spent too much time in the sun, too much time at the gym, and too much time drinking and smoking! The water, however, was awesome. Everyone on the west coast has told us that the east coast beaches are nicer because the water is warmer and clearer and there are waves. They were right! The water was just perfect and the waves were rolling in. Dennis Ked and I headed out to body surf a few. I think more of them crashed over my head than what I actually surfed, but it was fun nonetheless! Grant was such a cutie at the beach! He LOVED the water. He played and played at the edge and when Dennis tried to get him to go back to the towels he refused. He kept plopping down in the water and laughing. He even made friends with another little guy who had a ball.  After a few hours we started to head back to Kissimmee, but first stopped at the Ron Jon Surf Shop. That place was awesome!! Ked and I determined that we will definitely have to head back there again sometime. Later that evening we all jumped in the pool to rinse off the saltwater. It was another fun day!  Saturday we hung around the house and played with Grant and made good use of the pool. Grant is one of the happiest and cutest kids we've ever known. He is totally fascinated with hockey. Everything is hockey, hockey! He even thought the buttons on my pants were pucks. After we arrived on Wednesday night, I look out on the patio and Ked has a plastic basket over his head and is playing goalie against Grant. I wish you could have seen him with that basket on his head. I tried to take a picture but it was too dark. That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Ked told me later that Grant had grabbed his hand and made him put the basket on his head (it's his hockey mask) and play goalie. I laughed til I cried, it was such a funny sight! Grant loved Ked (I think because Ked was always game to play hockey!). When we were leaving on Saturday he gave Ked a sweet little hug.   Be sure to check out our  urlLink pictures ! Under Living the Po!nt, click on Adventures with the Klepadlos  Grant shows Ked his picture!                  "
"                  Say What??   I knew it was going to be interesting when I woke up at 7:30 this morning, especially since I didn't go to bed until 2 a.m. I made the mistake of having a cup of  urlLink Ked's coffee  at 8 p.m. last night and that was it. I was doomed from sleep. Apparently the caffeine was still working at 7:30 this morning, so I didn't fight it and got up and had a surprisingly productive morning. I crashed pretty hard this afternoon though for a little while.  I finished another writing lesson today and turned it in. My mentor sent it back right away with great comments. My blogging has been a tremendous help in finishing the assignments. Many times, I'm able to snatch a piece of the blog and edit it for the assignment. I have a feeling a couple of them will eventually turn into full articles that I will submit somewhere. I have a few ideas. I'm still trying to figure out where God wants to take all of this, but I'm not in a rush.  Tomorrow evening we're heading to Orlando to see Dennis, Hilary, and Grant and visit with Mickey on Thursday. I'll probably be off for a few days, but hopefully when I return I will have lots of great stories and pictures to share!!  TTFN!!               "
"                 Chillin in the Sun (can you chill in the sun?? Hmmm...)  Our weekend shaped up rather nicely. Ked spent Saturday working on his portfolio and resume and some OPMG projects. He and his skills are absolutely amazing. I was reviewing his new and improved PDF portfolio tonight and man!! I married an amazingly talented man. Speaking of portfolio and resume stuff, please pray for us over the next few weeks. Ked is getting ready to send a blitz of resumes out, and sent one tonight that would be a sweet opportunity. We would covet your prayers - that God would lead Ked exactly where He wants him and open doors of opportunity that no man can shut.  So while Ked was working on that Saturday, I spent the day scrapbooking!! I am the scrapbooking queen!! I get such an emotional lift from completing pages and finishing scrapbooks. I'm well on my way to wrapping up 2003. I have the goal of getting completely caught up this year. (I think it's every scrapbooker's never ending goal.) The way I've been booking it lately I just might make it.  Sunday was an absolutely gorgeous day and we try to make it a po!nt to get out and enjoy our Sunday afternoons. After church we came home and lounged by the pool for a couple hours. Ked (who has a perma-tan but always complains about how pale he is) got a nice jumpstart on his tan. In fact, today he is slightly pink!! After veggin by the pool we decided to go for a rollerblade. After my last incident, I made sure to wear thicker socks this time. We determined that we are going to need new rollerblades soon. Our current ones are six years old and have seen a lot of use. Mine were squeaking and groaning and making all kinds of noise. Actually, I was groaning and making noise too! Ked's just coasting along, but his extra pounds make it a lot of work for me to keep up with him!   We finished out our Sunday by having a cookout at Dave and April's place. They are in our Life Group, and we had a blast visiting with them. Dave grilled some delicious cajun grouper! They live on a lake and are serious wakeboarders. They took us for a spin on their boat and gave us the jungle tour of the lake. We're planning on trying to wakeboard sometime soon with them! That should be interesting. I've never been waterskiing or boarding before!!  Today was my whirlwind cleaning day and I got quite a bit accomplished. This week is going to be extra special. Our Michigan friends Dennis and Hilary are in Orlando with their little guy Grant for a couple weeks. Ked took Thursday and Friday off work and we're planning on hanging out with them at Disney (for our 3rd time this year - thank you Uncle Dan!) on Thursday and then chillin the rest of the weekend with them. They left Grand Rapids 6 months before we did and we've dearly missed doing life with them.   Ta-ta for now!               "
"                 More than Meets the Eye!  oooohhhh my! We had an interesting evening. This afternoon I found out about an event that just totally geeked Ked out. Most of you know his total fascination with Transformers Generation 1. There was a 20th anniversary gathering for Transformers at our local Toys 'R Us tonight. With prizes, displays, and lots of transformer geeks, Ked was in heaven (Ked's not a geek by the way)! When he found out about it he was prancing around the house 'can we go yet? can we go yet?' He cracks me up! I can't believe I hung around Toys 'R Us for 2 hours looking at Transformers!   After that I dragged Ked to Super Wal-Mart to go grocery shopping. I hate grocery shopping and going by myself makes it even worse. So I made him go with me. He's the super cart driver. He doesn't let me drive it because I don't pay attention!   Anyway, that was about it fer today!               "
"                  Cat Time   Well, I didn't make it to Bible study this morning and my day has been all mixed up. My body just doesn't operate on normal time. In my ideal world I would always go to bed at 2 am and get up at 10 am. I've always had trouble falling asleep when normal people do and I seem to get this burst of energy at 10 pm that lasts for a few hours. Even when I was working a normal job and did get a normal 8 hours between 10:30 pm and 6:30 am, I was never really awake until after 10 am.*sigh* Such was the case last night. I went to bed anyway and tossed and turned until well after 2 am. Needless to say when that alarm went off at 7 am, I just couldn't get up. I tried, but I was miserable. So I went back to bed. One of these days I'm going to have to get my sleeping schedule adjusted, but I just haven't figured out how yet.  I was going to take Ked to work tomorrow so I could have the car and run errands, but I have decided to wait until Saturday. One of the major roadways into town  urlLink collapsed  this week because of a sinkhole and traffic has just been MISERABLE as a result. It has taken Ked an hour to 90 minutes to get to work every day this week. I'm just not sure I want to spent over 4 hours in the car driving back and forth just so I can go to the grocery. I'll wait til Saturday.  We had another great time at Life Group tonight. We'll be wrapping up our marriage series next week and then we're going to dive into Romans. Life Group is a bright spot in our week. We always laugh a lot, and it really is amazing what a good medicine that is. By Thursday we're typically tired and ready for the weekend and the stressors of the week are weighing down on us. But Life Group gives us a boost going into Friday and rejuvenate us for the weekend. What a great group of people! Tonight Ked led worship and I found it quite inspirational (no, he didn't take his guitar!). He did a 'soak' which he learned from Nate last summer on the NYC trip. We listened to a Jeremy Camp song twice and the second time around we wrote down lyrics that spoke to us. We had a great dialogue as a group and it was interesting to hear the common thread of struggles that we all face. Then we played another song in the background and we each wrote an attribute of God on a 3x5 card and then passed the cards around the group adding our attribute to everyone's card. By the time we were done we each had a card with 14 different attributes of God that we can carry throughout the week to remind us of how Great and Wonderful He is. I found it to be a refreshing change of pace from our typical singing worship. It was neat to interact together and praise God in a different sort of way. We're on a journey together as we make our faith real and learn to apply it to our daily lives.  Well, it's 1:30 and I'm going to try to go to bed. Hey, I think I just figured it out!! I'm operating on CAT TIME!! Sadie is racing all over the living room with a poofy tail chasing her shiny balls. She's obviously wide awake. That's it. I'm operating on cat time. 1:30 C.T (cat time) = 6:00 P.M. Oh my. Ok now I'm rambling. Time to shut it down for the night.               "
"                  “Mail, you know, stamps and envelopes?”   I’m working on a project that sent me digging through my past today. As I shuffled through three storage tubs full of scrapbooks, photos, and letters I caught a whiff of nostalgia. Two shoeboxes filled with letters grabbed my attention. I chuckled even before opening the box because I knew what some of those letters said. I gravitated to one box full of letters from my old pen pals. I was a letter writing machine in my younger days and had pen pals across the country. It was a good thing too, since that is how Ked and I first became friends and how we started our dating relationship. I oh-so-diligent in keeping my letters organized: sorted by person and by date. Keeping in touch with my friends was serious business! The majority of this particular box was from my dear friend Karen. She was my first pen pal. We wrote hundreds of hilarious letters to each other over the years covering everything from the crazy science teacher to our latest crush. I read one of her letters today and she closed it “love your friend since 1984.” I read that line and thought “1984, wow!” Then I realized “Oh my word, that was 20 years ago!!” Not many people can say they’ve been friends for 20 years. That means I was only seven when we first became friends and started writing – I had just learned how to write!!  As I sifted through the letters a series of thoughts ran through my mind. There’s something to be said about writing letters. Before e-mail and before cell phones with free long distance, letters were the main way of keeping in touch with loved ones. I love smelling the paper (so, I’m a little weird!) and looking at the handwriting. Sometimes there were doodles all over the letter and envelope and even the paper, stamp, postmark, and addresses say so much about the era the letter was written in. A letter is so personal, so friendly, so real. A box full of letters contains so much history, so much culture, and so much about who the person was back then.  I attended a class at a scrapbooking convention where a genealogist talked about the importance of letters and diaries. She commented how, in our current age of phone calls and e-mails, we are losing so much history. Unless we keep all those e-mails (and how many of you have hit the inbox limit and had to clean it out!) or journal in a diary about who and what we talked about on the phone that day we lose all that history for future generations. How many of us have treasured letters written home during war time, or letters pining for the love of our life, or a precious letter from someone who has passed on? There’s emotion in a letter that e-mails just don’t even come close to.   I’m an e-mail, blogging, instant messenging junkie. I would never go back to the days where letters were the main, if not only, form of communication. I love being able to hop online and talk to my mom and friends thousands of miles away about what happened today. I love cell phones and knowing in an instant I can catch my loved ones no matter where they are. But I think that by completely eliminating letters from our communications we are losing a piece of ourselves and our friends that can’t be reclaimed. So maybe the next time you’re tempted to send an e-card for a birthday or a “thinking of you” e- mail, sit down and write a letter. It’ll show that you really care because you took the effort and the time, and it’s more likely to get stored in a shoe box in a closet for years to come.  Summer, 1984 Karen & Amelia                  "
"                  Gray Gray Go Away!!   The past two days have been gray and cloudy. That's really rare down here. There's a reason they call this kind of weather gloomy. That's how it makes me feel. So I was dragging myself around today trying to make myself do things and I had a thought. This kind of weather is Michigan (only a bazillion times colder) for half the year!! Then I wondered how on earth I ever got anything done up there!! Since I didn't feel like doing anything else, I spent most of the day scrapbooking. That activity produces some kind of natural endorphins and cheers me up. Maybe it's because looking at all those fun and silly pictures from times past makes me laugh and remember all the wonderful family and friends God has blessed me with. Yeah, I think that's it.   This evening I booked my ticket to fly up north this summer. I'm trying to get my plans in place, and I'd been praying about finding a good ticket price. Ked is driving up about 2 weeks after I come and we'll drive back together, so I only needed a one way ticket. I'd been looking for a few weeks and tonight I came across a steal of a deal. Now all I have to figure out is how I'll get from Flint to Nashville/Grand Rapids/then Grand Haven. But it will all work out, even if I have to rent a car. You just can't beat the price I got (unless it's free).               "
"                  Holiday Thoughts   I'm no theologian, but I have some pretty serious thoughts about Easter and Christmas. I've felt for a few years that something is missing in my life when it comes to these two monumental days. I guess Ked's rubbing off on me and I'm asking  urlLink What's the PO!NT?  Here's where I'm at.  A scene from a television show the other day keeps playing over and over in my head. The family was gathered around the table along with a few guests and they were celebrating the Passover. I furrowed my brow and began to contemplate a recurring thought that comes around every Christmas and Easter. I feel that my attendance at church on Sunday and maybe a Christmas Eve or Good Friday service just isn’t enough for me. Ked and I have discussed it quite frequently but we haven’t figured out a solution yet. Here are two events that radically changed my life, let alone the course of redemption for all humanity, and I go sit for an hour, think about it, and come home. We’ll have a great dinner with family and friends, but it always seems to me that something is missing. It’s one thing to gather around the table for Easter dinner, it’s quite another to sit down for Passover where every item on the table is a reminder of the journey God brought His people through. Sure, we celebrate the Lord’s Supper at church and while it’s significant it too seems to be lacking. We walk into church and sit through a forgettable half hour message (sorry to you pastors out there) and then for fifteen minutes we review Christ’s death and resurrection during the Supper and its over. That’s it. We go home and we’re on our merry way again. These events seem to merit more than just a little service at church and I can’t help but wonder what God really intended.   When I think of the Passover, it is an intense deal. I’m no scholar, but what I do know from reading the Old Testament was the Passover was   personal   - it was in your own home, with your family. There’s something to be said for readying your whole house and preparing a dinner that’s specific   purpose   is to remember something God did. And then there’s the Lord Supper. It too first took place in a   personal   setting -  Jesus with His twelve closest friends. It just seems to me that we have lost that familial meditation by leaving it to our local church to formulate the ritual for us, and even at that there isn’t much ritual to it.   I know, I know, for years we’ve tried to escape legalism and meaningless rituals. But that’s not what I’m talking about. My spirituality is crying to express itself in my home, through a meaningful tradition that is   personal and purposeful  , something I can pass on to my future kids, something we look forward to each year around those two holidays, something that as I prepare my home, those who live in it are also preparing their hearts and minds in anticipation, something that serves as a vivid reminder of what God did for us through Christ’s birth, death, and resurrection. I’m not looking for something to  make  me spiritual, but for a way to  express  my spirituality and immense gratitude for these two monumental events.   Please note , this is nothing against my family or my in-laws. I love our families and they have instilled in us an incredible foundation of faith and are stellar examples of cultivating Godly homes. I'm extremely grateful for them. When it comes to the issue of the holidays, I believe our families are like most traditional Christian families out there. I’m thinking that as the Body of Christ, we need to make more of an effort in our homes to make these particular holidays  personally and purposefully  focused on Christ. Presents and Easter baskets are fine and fun and should not be banished, but need to be generously supplemented with another tradition that serves as a reminder for the true meaning of the holidays. The Jews have the Passover, the Catholics have Lent, and we have well….nothing that takes place in our homes like that.   These thoughts are still raw and somewhat unformulated, so sorry for the rambling. I would love to hear your thoughts on the issue and what you have done or thought about doing in your own homes. Once I work through this, it could very well be my first book – Meaningful Homes for the Holidays.                 "
"                  Happy Easter!   Easter blessings to all of you. I hope you had a wonderful holiday with family and friends. President Bush wishes you a Happy Easter too. Read his Easter greeting  urlLink here !  Ked and I kept it pretty low key today. We went to church, came home and had a light dinner together. Then we called our families and chatted with all of them for quite awhile. It was good to catch up with everyone and rub in how warm it was today! It was nice to just relax together at home this afternoon. Then this evening our friends Bobby and Susan came over for dinner. Ked and Bobby went out to play basketball and got rained out. We had a wonderful thunderstorm come through this evening. We had a great visit with them and just really enjoy doing life together with them. They've become great friends since we moved here.  Last night we went to my great Aunt Jean and Uncle Lowell's house for some pizza! We had a great time visiting with them. They will be heading back to Ohio this week. We've really enjoyed getting to know them while they were down and look forward to seeing them next winter! On our way home, Ked and I were commenting on how many people we've been able to see since we moved here. We've seen family just about every month since we moved. That's been a nice treat. There's a handful of relatives that vacation down here regularly that we will now see more often than when we lived up north! And of course our goal is to get as many people to relocate down here as possible!!!  Well, I'm tired. I think that's it for today. Maybe next week I'll get more creative again. I have some holiday thoughts I'd like to process with you and get your input on. Maybe tomorrow.               "
"                 Weird Day  Hey, Karon! Glad to see you back online! That's hilarious about your NKOTB stuff, and I can't wait to see you in the t-shirt!  Well, my day yesterday was weird. Not bad, just weird. There was a string of things that just didn't quite go right and there was nothing I could do about it. That's when you just shrug your shoulders and chalk it up as a weird day. I was supposed to go to lunch with someone and they forgot. I went to pick up my contacts and they weren't in yet (been wearing my glasses for a week). Talked on the phone with someone and I knew they were frustrated and I didn't know what to do to help. Oh, well. Mama said there would be days like that!  There were some bright spots in the day, however, and they outshone the weirdness!! My women's Life Group in the morning went really well. I'm enjoying our study and there are two gals I'm getting to know better. It's been just wonderful! Then last night we had our couples small group. That group is always a riot; we laugh so much! I had a chance to chat briefly with one of the gals in the couples group who has been wrestling through some issues with her faith. I had been wanting to chat with her because I had a hunch that she was walking a path similar to one Ked and I walked a few years ago. Last night I mentioned a few things and her eyes lit up with relief that she wasn't the only one. It felt good to offer her some encouragement and let her know she's not alone. When we left, she hugged me and Ked tightly.  I was exhausted by the time we got home after Life Group and it didn't take long to fall asleep! Today, it looks like the sun is shining. I feel like a swim!               "
"                  Bookworm   Oh, I feel kind of like a nerd tonight, but I don't mind! I spent all morning at the library and I  loved  it! I got my first library card in ten years. Come to think of it, since I don't consider Cornerstone's library to be a real library, this was the first time in ten years I was in a library! I told myself that once we finished school I would begin reading again because I wanted to, not because I had to. My freshman year of college, one of my professors urged our class, 'Whether or not you finish college, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to keep reading.' I was so giddy as I searched through the online catalog. Finally I was free to look for what I wanted to read, not stuff for some boring research project where I'd just look for something to quote to get my ten sources in. Despite not being able to get The Glorious Appearing - they have 92 copies and 200 people on the waiting list - I was still satisfied with my finds. When I walked out of the library with my bag full of seven books, I had a grin on my face I couldn't wipe off! I picked up 2 novels for my pleasure, 2 books recommended in my writing course, and three non-fiction books I had heard of recently. I met Ked for lunch and then spent the afternoon on a park bench reading away. I read an entire 300 page novel this afternoon! Ahhh, it was nice.   On another note - I always thought that libraries were a safe haven from cell phones - a place of quiet refuge where you could study and think and not be bothered by that constant annoying ringing and being an unwilling eavesdropper on someone else's private conversation. As I was searching the online catalog, there was a man talking on his cell phone across the table from me (I thought that was illegal in libraries!!!). He droned on and on about his traffic record and how he was on probation and blah blah blah. Finally he left, and the gentleman sitting next to me leaned over and said, 'Did that drive you crazy??' I nodded my head and moaned 'Oh, yeah!' 'I don't care about his personal problems, man I can't even think over here! That was so rude! I'm glad I'm not the only one who was bothered!' he animatedly gestured while he talked making it tough for me not to giggle. This really gets down to cell phone etiquette. Someone should write a book, and if there's one out there, you should be required to read it and take a test before you buy a cell phone! Turn it off or to vibrate when you enter public places, if you must answer don't talk loudly, we don't want to hear about your recent traffic ticket. Don't answer when you're in the company of others unless it's extremely urgent because that shows your companions that you don't value them. And please, turn it off in the library!!!               "
"                 I experienced something for the first time today! I was lounging next to the pool catching up on some reading when a plane roared overhead. It was so loud, I looked up, and my mouth hung open in surprise. Flying somewhat low overhead was a big, beautiful, black stealth plane. Following not far behind it was a second stealth. As they zoomed across the sky, I felt my heart swell with pride for our military and all those who are serving here at MacDill Air Force Base and across the globe. Wow. It was an impressive display. I'd never seen one in the air before.  That was my excitement for the day. Not much else happened, and no major thoughts to process today!               "
"                 Today was a pretty typical Monday for me full of laundry and vacuuming and general clean up. I wanted to get all of that out of the way today so I could spend a lot of time reading the rest of the week. I'm going to find the Tampa Library later this week. My writing course is starting to catch up with me, and I'm realizing that I need to spend some focused time reading and researching in order to take full advantage of the course.  After dinner Ked checked the mail and brought back a stack of stuff. We mostly get junk mail and bills, so to get an Easter card was a nice change of pace. A dear, precious person sent us the sweetest card. When I opened it, a $20 bill fell out and I was like 'huh?' Ked and I looked at each other, and I read the enclosed note aloud.   'I have been thinking a lot about you lately. Then when I read your blog for yesterday (April 1) I knew why. I want to send you this little gift, and do something nice for yourselves with it. I am so proud of you, for what you are doing and standing for your beliefs.'   Ked and I just kind of stared at each other for a minute. It was totally unexpected and was one of the kindest, most thoughtful things anyone has done for us. We're used to being on the giving end of things, and when someone does something for us, it always takes us by surprise and means so much. I still don't know what to say about it. It was a huge encouragement just to know that someone was thinking of us and encouraging us that we are doing the right things. Just before Ked checked the mail we had been discussing a few things, and then we opened this card, and it was like God was using this person to say, 'See, I love you, and you are headed down the right path.'               "
"                  Hang on Tight!   *sigh* That's the sigh from a fun weekend! We started Friday night by heading out on the town to window shop at Circuit City, JoAnns, and the bookstore. Borders is one of our favorite places to hang out just browsing the books and seeing what's out there.  The first thing I saw when I walked in the store was a great big display of the Glorious Appearing - book seven of the Left Behind Series. I've been waiting so long to see who died!! And now I don't have any extra cash to buy it. So if anyone has the urge to do something nice for me and help me finish my collection that would be awesome!! ha ha ha.   Later Friday night I started sewing up a pair of pants for myself and finished them up Saturday morning. They turned out pretty cool! I love using my new machine!! Saturday we hung out here all day long. Ked was working on some OPMG stuff most of the day.  Today started out quite interestingly! We forgot to move our clocks forward last night!! So we overslept and the morning was just crazy!! After scurrying through our morning we managed to make it to Grandma's house in Sarasota for lunch with her, Aunt Betty, Uncle Alan, and Aunt Nancy. In a weak moment over Christmas, Alan had said he would take us jet skiing and we held him to it!! After lunch we headed down to Casey Key and he rented 2 two person jet skiis for an hour. What a BLAST!! Ours was a little smaller and WAY faster than theirs. The owner said he had souped up our jet ski. It was also a little tipsy, but we managed not to dump ourselves into the Gulf! I was hanging on for dear life and laughing and squealing for an hour. It was a blast!! We were CRUISING through that intercoastal! Alan said he never got his above 25 mph. His backseat driver (Nancy) wasn't too interested in going too fast! We would fly by them, so we were going at least 50 mph. We were covered head to toe in salt by the time we got back to Grandma's. Ked and I are definitely water people!   So tonight I am a refreshed tired, you know that good feeling you have after having played hard. That's what we love about being here - working hard all week - playing hard on the weekends.                 "
"                  Worship at Wal-Mart   Thursdays are always awesome and today was especially so. I started the morning with a heavy heart weary from worries. I headed to my women's Bible study and slapped on my 'I'm happy to be here' face. Today was different since we weren't actually doing our study but gathering with the rest of the women's groups and worshipping, fellowshiping over brunch, and sharing what God's been doing over the past six weeks. The worship time was incredible. This really is a special group of women who passionately love God. We sang a song that was new to me and the refrain kept talking to me about how we will all bow down before God's throne and kings will lay down their crowns. In that instant God reminded me that my worries weren't worth it. My heart was lifted as I laid it all down. I breathed a sigh of relief and the burden was lifted as I remembered I don't have to carry it alone. It's so easy to get caught up in this crazy life and lose sight of what really matters. I also had a great time of fellowship with two other gals about my age. All three of us knew each other and have traded small talk each week, but we'd never really talked. We hung out all morning at the event and enjoyed getting below the surface a little bit. We've all been transplanted a few times, and I could see in their eyes that they were as desperate as I was for someone to connect with. It's a beautiful thing.  After this wonderful gathering I headed to Super Wal-Mart to do some grocery shopping. I have a love/hate relationship with Wal-Mart that I'll have to expound on sometime. But today was a love day. I breezed through my groceries and got in line (oh the lines!) and realized I had forgotten to pick up a few things for a missionary in China. One of the couples in our Life Group had posted a message about some needs for a lady and her daughter who are missionaries to China. This gal's mom is heading to China next week and will be taking a suitcase of much needed supplies and items for her and her three year old daughter. I felt the heaviness in my heart start to creep back in. I turned my cart around and headed to the pharmacy aisles. I stared at the rows of generic brand Tylenol and started a conversation with God.    God, this is torture. You know how badly I want to help these people. You know how much Ked and I enjoy blessing other people. But where is the cash going to come from? We paid our bills last night, you saw the check registry. It hurts. It really hurts to not be able to give like I want to give.   I picked up a bottle of the generic Tylenol.  I can squeeze that from the grocery budget  I looked at the bottle in my hand and it didn't feel like very much.  O.K. I can get that tube of Lanacane too.  Still, it didn't feel right and I started to really talk to God about it (in my head of course, there were other people in the aisle). I remembered that Ked had said I could use our date money to help these people because 'we can always find free things to do.' That sounded good. I grabbed that envelope out of my purse and started to feel better.  What's a movie and dinner? I don't need that  So I picked up a kid's toothbrush and kids toothpaste. Then I looked over the list at the items the mother had said her three year old daughter needed. Pajamas (Winnie the Pooh if possible), sandals, socks... I looked into my purse and realized I had brought one more envelope of money labeled 'haircut'.  I don't need a haircut. I can wait two more weeks or longer. Yeah, I don't need that. Let's go find some Winnie the Pooh Pajamas!!    Suddenly my spirit was lifted and for the first time I understood sacrificial giving. I've never had to give something up to give to someone else before. Previously, we always gave because we really wanted to and there was excess. Now, I don't want you to think that we're starving, but we did go to one income and we're building a business. Things are going to be managed more tightly for awhile, and that's o.k. But it was really freeing to worship in Wal-Mart today as I shopped for a little girl across the globe who doesn't have access to what I do. She needs sandals and p.j.'s much more than Ked and I need to see a movie or get a haircut. I still wish we could have done more, but there were no more envelopes of  money and unless I wanted to not eat for two weeks or have our electric turned off, I had to stop. But it was right, and I hope God looked at it and saw that it was good. (On a side note, at the last minute I put that generic brand of Tylenol back - the only thing I was originally going to get. When I got to Life Group tonight, another gal brought in a bottle of that same generic brand Tylenol. God was even in the small stuff. He knew I didn't need to buy that bottle, but he knew I needed to pick it up and wrestle with it. AND my groceries turned out to be about $10 less than I thought they would be!)  And as if that wasn't enough, Ked told me that he had another great conversation today with the guy I mentioned yesterday. And whoever you were that was praying for Ked today, he could feel it, and it helped. Again, this guy brought it up and as Ked could sense that prayers had gone ahead of him, he took it to the next level. I really hope Ked eventually blogs about this at some point, because I can't even begin to convey how awesome this is. As we talked about it last night, I reminded Ked about Rob Bell's 'Rain' video we have. I suggested that if this person was willing it might really help him in his journey to understand what God really thinks of him. Ked took the video today, and this person was interested and said he's watch it over the weekend. If you haven't seen the Rain video or any others in the series that Rob has put together, check out  urlLink www.nooma.com . They are powerful, short videos packed full of amazing teaching. They are well produced and Rob is a phenomenal teacher. The website has just short clips and a synopsis of each video.  Well, that's all for now. I have lots of thoughts rollin around in  my head, but I'll save you and them for another day!               "
"                  Homesick   Well, today turned out to be rather boring. Ked slept off and on until noon! It's good for him though because he works so hard during the week and last week was a doozy. Anyway, I finally dragged him off the couch and to Michaels, JoAnns, and Wal-Mart. I picked up a few things for some projects and spent the rest of the afternoon and evening working on a project that I can't tell you about because it is for a certain reader's birthday on Wednesday. I believe that the aforementioned, unnamed reader will be quite pleased!!  Anyway as we were bumming at our place today we were a little bummed. It was the first time probably since right after we moved that we were a little homesick. But don't get your hopes up, we're not running home. While we miss everyone, and holidays when we have nothing to do and we know everyone up North is gathering are tough, we're still not interested in a mosquito infested swamp-land summer with an E.Coli infected beach and 30 below winters! But we are looking forward to seeing all of you in just a few weeks. I'll be sure to bring my bug repellent. Speaking of bugs, people had warned us about the bugs down here, but I have yet to get a mosquito bite. There are however an obnoxious amount of love bugs. We recently discovered that the love bugs were genetically engineered by the Univ of South Florida to eat mosquito larvae. They apparently do a great job because I haven't seen a single mosquito since we moved here. They also do a great job mating, hence their name and their overabundance. But we love em! Maybe I'll bring a jar up for you Michiganders this summer, but they probably wouldn't survive the trip.  Well, there's 10 minutes left in the Bolts Hockey Game and the score is 1-0, Tampa. These 2 teams are amazingly matched and it's been physical! Gotta go cheer!               "
"                  No wonder we treat them like children!   It seems to be that the majority of young couples our age have either a cat or a dog or both. It appears that pets seem to abate the baby bug, and I know several couples who buy a new dog everytime the baby bug bites! In conversations with our friends, it's quite common for the couple to refer to each other as 'mommy and daddy' and the pet as their child. Ok, I admit, Ked and I do the same thing! For seven years Sadie has been our pride and joy (and entertainment, especially when Ked puts tape on her paws!)  Interestingly, a 2002 pet survey shows that 'Americans have about 77.7 million cats and 65 million dogs. Compare that with the most recent America's Children study (2001), which reported that there were 72.6 million children 17 or younger in U.S. homes.' We have almost twice as many cats and dogs as we do children!! Instead of the baby boomers, we're the pet boomers...or something.  Anyway, just a bit of useless information for your holiday weekend. We're just hanging out here and Ked gave Sadie a bath today, which was quite amusing! She's all soft and fuzzy now.                  "
"                  Go Bolts!!   Today was a no makeup, stay in your scrubby clothes all day kind of day. You need those now and then. Ked got quite a bit of work done. In fact,  urlLink onPO!NT Media Group  has a new site as of today. Check it out! I worked on my scrapbooking today and am happy to report that I used up a bunch more of my paper and I am one layout away from being done with the year 2000! Next I just have to do Christmas 2003 and all of our pictures from this year. I'm going to have to save up my pennies to get the pictures printed though! I always think it's cool when the guys are interested in my scrapbooks. I'm not sure why it means so much, maybe because it's not something you typically expect from them. The other day on the phone Jason was asking about my albums and if I was going to bring them up this summer. When Kurt was here the first thing he did was flip through my albums and 'catch up.' I've been busy since we moved!  Tonight Ked and I watched the Tampa/Calgary Stanley Cup Game. I think it's only the 3rd or 4th game we've watched on t.v. Last fall we watched a few of the Yankees/Marlins World Series games. The Bolts didn't do too well tonight, but we did see a few good fights!               "
"                  At last, the WWII Memorial   On April 29, 2004 the  urlLink World War II Memorial  opened. Long overdue, this memorial is a tribute to all those who served and died during the second World War. Thousands of veterans will make the trek to Washington D.C. this weekend for the formal dedication on Saturday.  I'm proud of my family's military history. As many of you know, I was born in Okinawa, Japan while my Dad served in the army. My Grandpa Roger (my Dad's father) served in the navy during both in World War II and the Korean War. Kedron's Dad served in the airforce stationed in Alaska during the Vietnam War. Ked's Grandpa Rhodes was career airforce and served in WWII and the Korean War. Ked's Grandpa Carr was stationed in Africa during the Korean War. As you can imagine these men have hundreds of stories. (Although my Dad worked in communications and he still says he can't tell me what he did or he'll have to kill me!! =)  As I've been hearing about the WWII Memorial's dedication on the news it prompted me to dig up a story my Grandma Louise (Dad's mother) wrote and shared with me while I was in college. There are thousands of stories like this out there about World War II. As we head into Memorial Day weekend, let's make it more than the sunrise of summer and the first barbecue. Take a moment and remember all those who have given their lives across the ages serving our country so we can freely gather on weekends like these. And pray for the safe return of our men and women serving in the Middle East.  ____________  The date was Dec 7, 1941. My sister and I were home alone when the news came over the radio (before the days of TV) that Pearl Harbor had been attacked by Japan. That meant we were at war.   I was a freshman in high school at the time and my sister Betty was four years older than me. I had no idea at the time what impact that news broadcast would have on our family. In addition to my parents and my sister Betty, I had three brothers, and we lived a quiet life on the farm.  Dick, my middle brother, joined the army the following summer. We all went to visit him during basic training at Camp Perry. The following summer, 1943, my youngest brother Leonard joined the navy after graduating from high school.  By now most young men were in service unless he was declared 4-F meaning he couldn't pass the physical. Others got a deferment for a critical war job. My oldest brother Bob, fell in the latter category. When his deferment ran out, he was drafted and left for service on Christmas Eve 1943. We all went to the station to wave him goodbye. The weather was nasty and slippery. Only a call from Uncle Sam would bring a person out that Christmas Eve.  Bob went through boot camp then a shake down cruise with the ship he was assigned to, the Destroyer Meredith. He came home on leave before leaving for whatever assignment laid ahead. By now it was spring of 1944 and I was getting ready to graduate from high school. Bob bought me a black Parker fountain pen for my graduation gift. As he walked toward the front door, he said his last goodbye, cried, and said that he wouldn't be coming back. At that moment it didn't leave much impact on me because I knew he wasn't as eager to go off to service as my other brothers.  Three weeks later, in the middle of the night, there was a knock at the door. My dad asked who was there. The reply was 'It's Western Union with a telegram from the War Department.' Mom and Dad went downstairs immediately. I remember laying in bed, not wanting to know which one of my brothers the telegram brought news of. When I did go downstairs, the news was about Bob. His first trip out took him directly to the Normandy Invasion in the English Channel on June 6, 1944. His Destroyer was hit on the morning of June 8 and he was killed in action.  My thoughts went back to the last time I saw him only a few weeks earlier and the statement he made as he said goodbye. I still have and cherish my fountain pen.  My other brothers returned home safely.                "
"                  My Girl Won!!   Fantasia is the new American Idol! My girl won! I was so nervous as Ryan pulled out the envelope because this season has been so unpredictable. Last night Fantasia definitely out-sang Diana. Tonight I was excited to hear George and LaToya sing again and I couldn't help but think how much better both of them were than Diana, but oh well. I'm sure they'll do great in the long run.  Both yesterday and today I have been sooooo tired!! It's all I can do to drag myself through the day. I told Ked we should take a walk after dinner, and so we did. We walked to Brusters for some ice cream. =) As we were walking there we stopped and looked at a mother turkey duck (I'm sure that's not its name, but it's a duck with a turkey's head! honest!) and her nest. We discovered this nest on Monday with Kurt and Michelle. On Monday, the mother duck was sitting on a whole bunch of eggs. Today most of them had hatched!! They were so cute and fuzzy and so tiny!! They were playing with each other and waddling around. It was so precious! I just really don't understand how people can deny God's existence when viewing the amazing creation of life.  Amelia Out!               "
"                  24   I've spent today doing the mundane post-company activities of laundry and cleaning up. Seems rather boring after the adventures of the past week. Oh well, it's back to the routine. At least Ked only has to work 3 days this week and then it's another long weekend!  In honor of the season finale of 24 I have worked up new lyrics for  urlLink Switchfoot's  song '24.' Enjoy!!  Twenty four hours Twenty four scenes Twenty four episodes Twenty four tries Twenty four finds me In front of my tv Twenty four bad guys At the end of the day Life is not what I thought it was Twenty four hours ago  Still I'm waiting, Jack, take up arms and do the bad guy in And he’s not who I thought he was twenty four hours ago Still I'm waiting, Jack, take care of the terrorist.

"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #6   Wow I am tired tonight!! I need to hurry up and finish this blog so I can go to bed. We had another great day with Kurt & Michelle. We hung out here all day by the pool. Michelle and I headed down to the pool around 11 and the boys joined us at 1. Then she and I ran to Chick-Fil-A to pick up some lunch and we ate by the pool. About 3 p.m. we decided to say goodbye to the sunshine and walked down to Brusters for some ice cream to finish out our visit. They packed up and we dropped them off at the airport around 6 p.m. As we were driving away from the airport, Ked looked at me and said, “That’s sad seeing them leave.” It always is sad when we drop someone off at the airport after a great visit. It just makes us realize all the more how much we value these relationships. It is nice to be the place that everyone 'gets away' to. We love seeing the stress melt away as the sun relaxes our guests with each passing day. Ked even commented on Sunday that he noticed the bags were gone from under his eyes. He needed this break as well! We had such a nice relaxing time together with Kurt & Michelle. It was good for all us. At least it won’t be long and we’ll be up for their wedding. (We also think we did a good job convincing Michelle this wouldn't be such a bad place to live. At lunch today she made a comment 'well when we move to Florida...' We all caught the 'when' part! We're taking over the world ha ha ha!!)   I have posted a new web album of our pictures from Kurt & Michelle's visit. You can click  urlLink here  or on the link under Living the PO!NT.  Also in other news, Ked has moved his blog to  urlLink www.kedron.ailema.com . If you have links to him on your blogs, please change them. He promises to blog more frequently!  Well the sun has scorched my brain today. I'm tired. Goodnight Blogging World!!               "
"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #5   Yesterday was a nice relaxing day thanks to Kurt and his sunburn! He was not interested in going to the beach again so we hung out here for most of the day. He and Ked worked on pasting together 11 of Kurt's panoramic photos from Alaska and then they worked on getting Kurt & Michelle each set up with their own blogs. Michelle & I decided that the boys were boring, so we headed down to the pool for a couple hours and had a fabulous time chatting and working on our tans!  Later in the afternoon we headed out to see Van Helsing. It was kinda scary!! But it was good, and Hugh Jackman always does a great job. After the movie we headed over to Bucca Di Beppo's for some giant pizza!! It was delicious! Then Kurt insisted we run through Target (because he misses them so much! ha!) for some aloe lotion for his sunburn. Then we headed back to our place and vegged some more. Actually, we watched ramp on TV. It was hilarious because the movie is so old and the sound effects were cheesy. They used the same sound for a gunshot as they did for a missile. I think we had more fun making fun of the movie than actually watching it.  Anyway, today is their last day here and I think we're taking it easy again today!                  "
"                  Pictures as promised from Day #4!!   An alligator at Myakka River State Park       Sunset at Siesta Key Beach                 "
"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #4   Another perfect day in paradise   Wow, what another absolutely gorgeous day! Kurt & Michelle couldn't have asked for more perfect weather for their vacation. We started out this morning after breakfast running a couple errands and filling the gas tank before heading down to Sarasota to Grandma's house. The guys got fired because they took WAAAAY too long (Kurt!) scoping out new snorkels and masks. They left us girls waiting and waiting outside JoAnn's (and believe it or not we were only in for a few minutes!)  We swung by Grandma's house and visited with her for a little bit and planned out our day. We put her shark's tooth scoop in our trunk and headed down to Venice. After swinging through a couple cool but kinda cheesy tourist shops we ate a nice picnic lunch in the park and then headed to Casperson Beach to hunt for shark's teeth. We met up with Grandma at the beach (her second home). She showed Kurt & Michelle how the hunt works. We found a nice bag full of teeth and even managed to scoop up some good sized ones. Grandma had the find of the day with a nice sized tooth that will make Kurt a nice necklace.   After Kurt started getting crispy we decided we would head out for some ice cream. Grandma led the way to Nokomis Groves and their famous ice cream stand. She had an orange vanilla swirl cone and the rest of us had a lime and chocolate swirl cone. Oh man was that delicious. There's something about the beach and ice cream that just goes together.   After our ice cream Grandma headed home and the four of us went alligator hunting. We headed to Myakka State Park, known for their alligators. We were not disappointed! We stopped at a bridge over looking the river and I think the guys took about a hundred pictures of the gators. They were cool and yet so scary!! They look tranquil in the water but just knowing what they are capable of is enough to put the fear in ya!  After we had our fill of gators we headed back to Grandma's and picked her up and headed to our favorite fish spot for dinner - Captain Curt's on Siesta Key. Kurt & Michelle had never had grouper before and we always order the grouper your way sandwich at Capt Curt's. I always get the grilled cajun grouper sandwich (ha ha, Dad I know you are jealous now!!!) Kurt tried it cajun fried and Ked and Grandma tried it fried and Michelle opted for a burger and tried some of Kurt's grouper since she's not a big fish fan and wasn't sure she would like it (but she did!) Yes grouper rocks and is my favorite fish of all time!!  After dinner we headed down to the beach on Siesta Key and got there just in time to see the big fireball sun set into the water. It was amazing how many people were there to watch the sunset. What is it about the sun that so fascinates us? We want to bake in it all day and we love to see it rise and see it set. It was a gorgeous pink sunset and the sun was enormous. It was a perfect way to end another perfect day. The beach was full of couples young and old walking hand in hand, hugging and kissing. A sunset on the beach is so romantic. *sigh*  We have been talking about key lime pie for days now and tonight we decided we had to get some. Kurt & Ked dropped us off at Grandma's and then they headed out to Publix for some pie. They were so sweet and even picked up Grandma half of a peach pie (her favorite!) and then a whole key lime pie for the four of us. Oooooohhhh, it was soooo yummy!! Ked is hilarious, he was grading the pie. He said he had to savor the moment with a cup of coffee and took his time eating his slice. Then he was comparing all the key lime pies he has ever eaten. Publix gets an A, and Pebbles (a restaurant we stumbled across in Orlando) gets an A+.  Grandma was glad to have the company today. She's always so much fun to be around. She said we kept her day from being 'ho-hum.' She is the shell queen and has collected shells off the Florida coast for well over 20 years now. Her place is filled with them! She made sure to show them off to Kurt & Michelle. She was talking about the miracle of all the life in the sea and all the creative shells. It truly is amazing.  Well that brings us up to now, 11:30 p.m. and we are all about to  pass out again. There's something so refreshing about sleeping hard after such a fun day of playing.  So goodnight world!! I'll post more pictures tomorrow. They didn't download them to my computer yet from their cameras tonight. They pretty much went straight to bed, and now it's my turn!               "
"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #3   It was another beautiful, fun-filled day in paradise!! We slept in this morning after our busy Disney day yesterday. After a run to Wal-Mart for some goodies we headed to Lithia Springs. It was kind of disappointing because the water levels were a lot lower than they were when we first visited the spring last fall. Nonetheless, it was still beautiful. We swam for awhile and took some underwater photos and then decided to head out and explore around the springs with our cameras. The springs are surrounded by jungle and it makes for fun adventure.  Next we headed home for a late lunch and then Ked called Dave our wakeboarding friend. He had offered to take all of us wakeboarding while Kurt & Michelle were here. Michelle was psyched up and ready to go. Kurt was a little more hesitant, but with encouragement he was ready to tackle the wakes. Ked went first and he got up right away. He did much better than he did last time. After his first run he decided to start moving outside the wake. He bit it the first time but the second time he did great. On his last run he decided to get smart and ended up with his board perpendicular to the wake which is exactly what Dave had warned against. Yeah, Ked bit it HARD face first in the water. He said as he was sinking and sinking he was wondering if he was going to hit bottom and he was thanking God he had a life vest on!! Dave told him that there are neck muscles that you didn't know you had that tomorrow morning Ked will be feeling! But Ked is a wild and dangerous guy and he was just giddy.   Next up was Michelle and on her second try she was up and out of the water. After a few more tries she had a beautiful run. If the lake was forever long she never would have fallen, but when we took the corner to turn around you get an extra bumpy ride. She survived the turn but eventually the wakes caught up with her. She came back to the boat totally excited and said her legs were pretty shaky!!   Then Dave and his friend Joel took to the water and showed us how it was really done. Holy cow!! They were awesome! They were flipping and twisting and turning and they were like 'la, la, la this is a piece of cake!!' It was soooo cool! We did see an alligator in one part of the lake....so everyone tried hard not to fall in that area!!  Then it was Kurt's turn. It took him a little longer than it took Michelle to get up. But Dave says that girls always catch on quicker than guys do...because they listen better (honest that's what he said!!) We'll give Kurt some credit though, Dave had to leave soon so Kurt was under pressure to catch on quickly. He was up for a few seconds and then his last run he did great. We were all cheering. We ran out of time, so I didn't get a turn, which is totally fine with me. I live here!!  So we came home and had a late supper and now I have to listen to these 3 complain 'oohh, my forearms are sore; oh my legs hurt; I'm such a wussy and I'm so sore (ok, well I added the wussy part in!! =)  So here are some pics of the crew!!  Ked's got it goin on!!    So does Michelle!!    We love the look on Kurt's face! It says oh my word, I'm up!! I hope I can stay here!!    Yeah, and this is how the pros do it - upside down!! (our friend Dave)                 "
"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #2   Wow! What a day yesterday was. We all slept REALLY well (and long!) last night. We started out early and left here by 7:00 a.m. and grabbed breakfast on the run at McD's. The only think I like at McD's is their breakfast and the McGriddles are the best! We met Uncle Dan at the gate of Animal Kingdom and he let us in. He's so cool (and not just because he gets us into Disney World!). We roamed with the wild animals until about 3 p.m. Ked commentated the whole trip on our video camera as if he was the Crocodile Hunter. I may have to put part of that on my blog soon. He was cracking us up! So after viewing lots of cool animals, a couple shows, and getting drenched on the Kali River Rapids, we headed to the Magic Kingdom.  Disney in general is such a fantasy world. Their attention to detail is amazing. They just don't build a rollercoaster and put up gates for a line. No, it's a rollercoaster inside a building that is totally themed and there's plenty of interesting things to look at while waiting in line. Everywhere I looked yesterday, someone knew that I would look there and there was something to look at, even the tiniest crook and cranny had been planned.  So we whisked our way through the majors at the Magic Kingdom - Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Mickey's Philharmagic, and the Haunted House. By 6 p.m. we headed the bus for MGM and dinner! We only wanted to hit the Rockin Rollercoaster and the Tower of Terror at MGM and the big event of Mickey's Fantasmic - the park's closing show. We sat in the amphitheater for about 45 minutes as more and more people flooded in. Once the place was full, someone started the wave. It always amazes me how people everywhere do the wave. Ked says it's because people like to be part of something bigger than themselves. Over and over we stood and did the wave until it finally fizzled not long before the show started. And what a show it was!! WOW! They did one of the coolest things we've ever seen. They sprayed a wall of mist and used the mist as a video screen to project a movie on. It was the coolest thing. We ended our day with a bang and then drove home and went straight to bed!! It still feels good to sit down this morning!!                  "
"                  The Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #1   I started waking up at 6:30 this morning. I haven't done that since we moved here. We were both excited that Kurt & Michelle were arriving today. When you wake up earlier than the alarm there's always that mental conversation 'I'm awake, do I just get up, or can I ignore it and maybe doze for a little while?' I usually convince myself to doze and this morning was no exception.  We headed downtown and picked Kurt & Michelle up at the airport at 11:00 a.m. Ked headed inside to baggage claim while I stayed and guarded the car from those pesky airport security guys who think every unattended car is a security danger. I watched through the window as Kurt came down the escalator and saw Ked. The look on his face was pure joy and excitement and the brothers gave each other a hearty hug. I smiled and thanked God for the relationship they have and the time we get to spend together. They've both been like little boys all day long, chattering away, making other bodily noises - ahem!, and having a great time. Right now they're outside playing with their cameras in the sunset. (Kurt recently bought the same model that Ked has).  We loaded their stuff in the car and asked them what they would like to do. Since we were already half way to the beach we decided that would be a great way to start the trip! We grabbed some sandwiches at Subway and then headed to Ft DeSoto for a picnic and a few hours of sun and surf. It was an absoulutely gorgeous day, and perfect beach weather! The breeze was slight and the water was calm, clear, and blue. After lathering up with sunscreen we headed into the warm bath-like water with our snorkels to see what we could see. The find of the day was a giant, live sand dollar. He had to be 8 inches in diameter and a few inches thick. We all observed him on the ocean floor and then Kurt picked him up for a closer look. After we huddled around and oohed and aahed over God's creativity, we sent him back to his home. We found some other cool shells and Michelle and I spotted an unusual fish that looked like an eel with a long, needle nose. It was just a gorgeous day to be at the beach!  After a few hours we headed back to our place. After giving a quick tour of the apartment we headed down to the pool to rinse off the sand and saltwater. Ahhh, the life! I whipped up a nice dinner of corn on the cob, burgers, and coleslaw with strawberry shortcake for the dessert. And now I’m blogging, Michelle’s sleeping and the guys are out shooting pictures. It was a great day and the perfect way to start our trip. We’ll all sleep well tonight which is a good thing since tomorrow we are going to Disney World!!!                "
"                  Are You Ready?   Well we're all ready for Kurt & Michelle's arrival tomorrow! It's been so cool to have so many family and friends come visit us this year. We're looking forward to more of you visiting in the future!   I got quite a bit done today. I had fallen horribly behind on my writing lessons. I came to a lesson that I was totally uninterested in and so I stalled and stalled and stalled... I finally finished it up last night and then today I completed another one, so I am back on track! Now that I'm past that I'm getting to the interesting stuff. Look out here I come! I'm just not sure where I'm going yet! =)  Ked's cleaning the bathroom right now. He's such a good guy! I was going to clean it, but he insisted that he would take care of it. That's such a beautiful sight - the man cleaning the bathroom. Honestly, he gets it way cleaner than I ever do. I've always thought that guys make the bigger mess so they should clean the bathroom anyway.  Well only one more week of American Idol left. Fantasia totally rocked tonight. Clive Davis pretty much told her tonight that he'd give her a contract. All the judges told her she didn't need this competition anymore and that she will be a star. That makes me feel better just in case another disaster happens this week like it did to LaToya last week.  Well, I'm going to sign off and send my lesson to my instructor, so I can enjoy the adventures this week without that hanging over my head!  Amelia Out!                 "
"                  Peanut Butter and Smokey Robinson   This afternoon I was watching  urlLink Ryan on Air  like I always do (it's my late afternoon break) and they featured a restaurant that would be like heaven to me! My favorite food of all time is peanut butter! I've been found many times dishing peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon with five previous peanut butter spoons already in the sink! On the show today they featured Peanut Butter & Co in New York City where every sandwich is made with peanut butter!! I was so excited I went to the kitchen and dished a spoonful of peanut butter. Not only do they have all sorts of yummy peanut butter sandwiches, they also make and sell their own natural peanut butter, including cinnamon crunch peanut butter and white chocolate peanut butter. You can check them out online at  urlLink www.ilovepeanutbutter.com !! I think a trip to NYC is in order!!  Also on the show today was  urlLink Smokey Robinson , the Motown legend. He has a new album out and Ryan was asking what inspired this album. Smokey started talking about how he felt God calling him to do this album and how he's always had a close relationship with God. I thought to myself 'yeah, yeah, lots of famous people give credit to God. I hope he's genuine and for real.' As if reading my thoughts his next sentence was, 'I have a close and personal relationship with Jesus Christ and this album will allow people to see that part of my life.' I thought 'WHOA!! That was cool!' So now I'm thinking I need to buy his album and support this legend. I was so excited that he took it one step farther than just crediting God and actually talking about his personal relationship with Christ. I was impressed. His new album is  urlLink Food for the Spirit.   I spent the rest of the day doing the Monday Mundane - laundry, vacuuming, cleaning up, and getting ready for Kurt & Michelle's visit! Ked and I didn't get to walk tonight since we had some rain. We're supposed to get a great thunderstorm tonight. I hope we do! I love falling asleep to the sound of rain on the roof.  Well goodnight everyone!               "
"                  Adventures Ahead   Well I've been out of it for a few days, but that would be because I was spending time with my bestest friend in the whole world. No, not you Sadie, stop mugging me! Kederoni!!  (insert commentary here -- when I was in high school a friend thought my last name sounded like Parmesan --although it didn't really-- and gave me that nickname, which evolved into just 'cheese' so when I started dating Ked we became Kederoni and Cheese. I don't know why I just told you that but writing Kederoni reminded me of it!)   We had a great weekend, even though we went to the grocery store 4 times. We both hate grocery shopping, and Ked always wants to get in and out as fast as possible, but I don't like to be rushed when I'm deciding what kind of mustard to buy. This is very important business!! Anyway, it's always wall to wall people at the Super Wal-Mart no matter what time you go, and the check out lines at Sam's Club always look like a parking lot full of shopping carts. The one bright spot is we found an awesome fresh food market that we love. The prices are phenomenal and the produce is so beautiful it makes me want to load my car full of fruits and vegetables and become a vegetarian. The buy of the day was a basket full of juicy Georgia peaches! Yum!  Anyway, the excessive grocery shopping was in preparation for Kurt and Michelle's visit this week. They arrive Wednesday morning and we're planning all kinds of fun adventures, again in our scheme to convince everyone to move to Florida!! ha ha ha!! So stay tuned for a recap of our fun adventures and embarrassing pictures of Ked and Kurt picking their noses and all kinds of gross things that brothers do when they are together  (which also involves all kinds of odd smells--too bad this blog isn't scratch and sniff!).   It was a gorgeous weekend. Ked and I have been walking in the evenings around 8 p.m. just as the sun is going down. It's warm with a light breeze and the natives are active. We walk past an interesting swamp like area  (which one night I had a dream that an alligator was chasing me through -- even though I've never seen one there. What's up with all the commentaries tonight??).  Saturday evening on our walk we saw a cool, giant painter turtle hanging out by the path. We stopped and stared at him and he stared right back at us. We had a contest to see who could go the longest without blinking. He won. Then there were two busy muskrats frolicking in the water. The ducks didn't seem to mind their ruckus and joined in the play. It was a lovely walk. We strolled hand in hand soaking in the sunset and the activities of God's creation.  Today after church we hung out by the pool for awhile. Ked wants to make sure he has a good tan so he can make Kurt jealous. I keep telling Ked he has a perma-tan and that he doesn't need to worry.  Several of you have asked if I am sleeping any better and praise the Lord I am!! I think it was Thursday night I had my best night's sleep in a long time. Things have been much better since then, although last night I did have another odd dream, something about being a guest star on Friends...but I woke rested!  Well Ta-ta-for-now! It will be an awesome week!!               "
"                  New Video!!   Well, yesterday was an interesting day! Ked kept telling me that I should get into editing our videos. He thought that I would enjoy it as much as scrapbooking. So yesterday I started working on our previously unviewed Alaska video. With our crazy move to FL right after the trip, the first time we even viewed the footage was just a couple months ago. To make a long story short, I spent ALL day on it yesterday! Those who know me know that I can't stand to leave a project unfinished! That's one of the reasons that I love scrapbooking. I can finish a layout in a good amount of time and feel so good!! Anyway, I took an hour of tape and condensed it down to an 11 minute video. We so badly need to get a dvd burner!! Hopefully soon. Anyway, I have posted them here on my site for your viewing pleasure. You need Windows Media Player to view it and Ked thinks maybe Quicktime will work too. The dial up version is pretty yucky. It's grainy, but anyway, that's the joy of having dial up... ha ha ha!! The broadband version is a lot better, but still it's best to not view it at full screen, but in a smaller window. Anyway, if you're able to watch it, I hope you enjoy it! And as soon as we have a dvd burner, we'll get copies to all of you who were on the trip!   urlLink Alaska video broadband (12 mb)    urlLink Alaska video dialup (3 mb)                "
"                  Monday Blahs   Today was rather blah. I had another horrible nights sleep. I was laying in bed at 4 a.m. awake, and I'd been in bed for a few hours. This is insanity!! Today I wasn't motivated to do anything. I did manage to get the place cleaned up and the laundry done. I really need to finish another writing assignment, but this particular topic just doesn't interest me, so I'm avoiding it. Maybe tomorrow. So I scrapbooked this afternoon. Whenever I'm unmotivated I figure I can at least scrapbook so I feel like I accomplished something. I got quite a few pages done this afternoon. I'm working on my pictures from 2000, because for some odd reason I skipped that year. Once I finish 2000, I'll be all caught up on our married life. That will be exciting!! It's weird scrapbooking pictures from that long ago. It's amazing how different we look and it was just four years ago. I had braces and it was pre-flippy haircut. Ked's hair was short and pre-spikey style. I'm not putting much detail into these pages because I don't remember much about the events, so I should be done with them rather quickly!!  Tonight I started working on a video of our Alaska trip. It's going to be quite a project. I could only get half the video on my machine before I ran out of room. I'll chop it up and then get the other half on here. It's going to take me a little while to finish it! But it will be cool once it's done. Maybe I'll post it here someday.  Well, maybe I can get some sleep tonight!! bbye!               "
"                  Happy Mother's Day!   I'm very blessed to have two special mothers in my life - my Mom and my Mother-in-law! I owe them both so much!! So here's looking at you both....  To my Mother-in-law: I was recently sitting around a table of women who were bemoaning what a terrible job their husbands did with their birthdays. One lady had even told her husband exactly what she wanted to do for her birthday, and he still didn't get it and dropped the ball. I sat there silently through the discussion so thankful for Ked, and for how well you brought him up! Ked not only does a wonderful job with my birthday every year, but the key is he  listens  to me. I know that he's such a great husband in part because he had a great relationship with you growing up. You have a lot to be proud of when it comes to Ked! Not only does he understand how to listen and communicate with me, he knows how to load and unload the dishwasher, do laundry, run a vacuum, and he cleans one mean toilet! I never take for granted how well you brought him up. All those years when we were both working it helped so much to have a husband who not only knew how to do household work, but was more than willing to do his share. And of course the spiritual foundation he received in your home has made him an incredibly Godly man and a leader of our household. I can fully trust myself with him and his direction. Thank you so much for raising a wonderful man!!  To my Mom: I'm sure there were times when I was growing up that you wondered what type of woman I would become. I was always losing everything! It never ceased to amaze me that you knew  exactly  where I had left my keys, socks, shorts, shoes.... And then there was my room! Most of the time it was a disaster. I'm sure you wondered if I'd ever be able to keep a clean and organized home. I'll never forget my first cooking experiment. I think I was in the 7th grade and I had learned this yummy coffee cake recipe in home ec class. I still laugh everytime I remember Dad, Jason, and your faces as you took small bites of it at breakfast. Finally Dad asked if maybe I had forgotten something. I pulled out the recipe and read baking powder and thought aloud 'Hmmmm...baking powder, I think I used baking soda. Is there a difference??' We all got a good laugh out of it and I assured everyone they wouldn't hurt my feelings if they threw it in the trash! Well, at some point all of your teaching sunk in. Not only did you give me the skills to run a clean and orderly home, Ked also heartily approves of my cooking (I never again confused baking soda and baking powder)! And now, when he asks me where his keys, socks, shorts, and shoes are I understand how it was that you always knew where everything was! But more importantly, I remember so many times coming downstairs in the morning and seeing you reading your Bible. I always knew that you were praying for me and Jason every single day. How can I ever say thanks??  Happy Mother's Day!! Me & My Mom 2003                 "
"                  Fun, fun, fun...   Today has been a fun filled day! I met Grandma Louise this morning at the Barnes and Noble just off the highway and she and I headed to 'Daughters of the King: Mother's Day Tea' at our church. It was so much fun to spend the morning visiting with her. It's so nice to have family around. As we visited and chatted about various family members it was refreshing to my soul to connect with someone who has known me all my life and knows all about my family and my history. It's not that we talked about anything big, it just was nice to have that connection. Once I moved out of state to go to college I never lived at home (or in Ohio) again. So for the past nine years I've only had intermittent contact with the people who've known me my whole life. It's been nice to be closer to Grandma and visit with her regularly. She and Grandpa always spent the winters in Florida so our time with them growing up was limited to the summers. Then after Grandpa died she moved permanently to Florida and I saw even less of her. So needless to say, these past six months have been a joy to be just up the highway a few miles, and having her close by has made the adjustment a little easier. She was proud of herself that she drove all the way up here today. It's about 60 miles and the farthest she drives day to day is about 12 miles to her favorite beach! She was telling everyone she met at the tea how she drove all by herself. It was cute! On the way into the church she was telling me how she won the doorprize yesterday at her Super Seniors church event. I told her maybe she was having a winning streak. And would you believe that she won one of the doorprizes today too? She won 3 beautiful lilies that will look just perfect in the flower bed behind her place. She was thrilled! We had a nice time together and she finally got to see where we are living.  While we were at the tea, Ked went wakeboarding with our life group friends Dave & April. It was Ked's first time boarding and he said it took him about 4 tries before he was able to get up to stay. He said it was a blast! Dave & April wakeboard all the time and he said they were doing all kinds of trick and jumps. Dave said next time out he'll teach Ked a few things. It really tired Ked out! He took a nap on the couch this afternoon and now he's complaining how sore his legs are!!  While Ked was napping I tried out my new swimsuit and headed to the pool for a couple hours. It was a gorgeous day and the water was perfect. Ahhh.... Now, I'm trying to decide whether to go to the grocery tonight or tomorrow after church. I despise grocery shopping. But what can you do??  'til Daddy took the T-bird away!  Me & Grandma at the tea this morning                  "
"                  Can I just get some sleep???   Ok, so to continue from where I left off last night.... I finally went to bed about 2:30 a.m. (thanks to the coffee I drank before Life Group). I'm sleeping great and at 5:30 a.m. (right in the middle of my deep sleep) I hear a funny noise. You know how you hear an unusual noise in the night and in your grogginess you try to decipher if it's a noise you should be concerned about...This noise kept waking me up and soon Ked was up too. Then we both realize some guy is standing out on the sidewalk throwing a can (beer can) at our neighbors window. Tink, rattle, tink, rattle, tink....over and over and over!! Ked gets up and peeks out the window and there's this drunk idiot on the sidewalk who had apparently been kicked out. In a slurred bellow we heard 'you can't keep me out forever!!' tink, rattle... Had we been a little more with it we should have called the cops. This went on for like an hour. It was miserable!! Needless to say, I slept in until almost 11 this morning. Surprisingly once I got up I was pretty productive.  Tonight Ked and I hung out and rented a couple movies. We did the 2 movie, popcorn and candy deal at Hollywood video. We ate a whole bag of reeses pieces and we're both way too sugared up. We don't eat much sugar anymore, and that was way overdose. I don't think I'll need any sugar for a couple months! It was fun to veg on the couch together. We rented Matrix Revolutions since we hadn't seen it yet. We heard all the reviews and decided just to rent it. I'd have to agree with the reviews. It was a very poor ending for the trilogy. I almost fell asleep several times! We also rented Dickie Roberts Former Child Star. That one was pretty funny.  Well, I need to head to bed. Tomorrow Grandma Louise is coming up and she and I are going to a women's event at our church. It should be a lot of fun!!  Amelia Out!!               "
"                   So no one told you life was gonna   Well today was a bittersweet day as we said goodbye to our Friends. I'm not sure I can handle this!! Last night it was George Huff and tonight it's Friends. We also watched Jay Leno who had the six on and showed a lot of outtakes. We laughed our heads off! Those were the best. Anyway...we did go to Life Group in case you're wondering! We taped the show and watched it after we got home.  I'm pretty wired, as you can see it's after 1 a.m.!! First I had a cup of coffee before going to Life Group because I was sluggish. I didn't sleep well again last night. The mattress is awesome, I've just been having weird dreams causing restless sleep!! Anyway, I drank a cup of coffee to help me wake up so I could be social and participate at Life Group tonight. And well, anytime I have a cup of coffee after 6 p.m. it keeps me going for quite awhile. Then to top it off Life Group was awesome tonight. So I'm really wired. We started a study in Romans which is one of my 3 most favorite books of the Bible (the other two are Ephesians and James). I have been so thirsty for a study like this where we just go to the Bible and allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us through the Word - not some other author's opinions and thoughts, just the Bible. The interaction is so refreshing as we all learn from each other what God is teaching us.  I'm a big fan of the Fisherman studies because they know how to ask just the right questions to make you think about the text and help you come to your own conclusions. They are a good guide to help you in your own discovery. I completed the study yesterday and then read and prayed through it again today and I feel like a cracked, dry sponge soaking up water. And we only went through chapter one!!  I came away from Romans 1 with a few thoughts. It started in the first verse. we hear so much about mission and visions statements today that it often becomes 'blah blah blah.' We all know we 'should' have one written down, and many of us probably at one point did write one down but we probably don't review it very often. Paul had a clear mission statement and he reviews it at the beginning of all his letters. Romans starts 'Paul a bondservant of Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of Christ.' I read that over and over and throughout those first few verses you get a very clear picture that Paul knew who he was and what his po!nt in life was. I've been wrestling with my po!nt lately, ok well for awhile. And today I was praying 'God, will you please help me fill in those blanks? I'm Amelia, a bondservant of Christ, called to______ set apart for________.' I know I have a calling as all believers do to be a Godly spouse and support Kedron and love and encourage my fellow believers and reach out to those who are still on their journey to Christ. Yet I feel like beyond those general callings of all believers there's something else specifically where God wants to use my spiritual gifts. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, or maybe I'm thinking too highly of myself, but when I expressed my struggle tonight the other ladies of the group lit up and said they too have the same struggle. The Apostle Paul knew he was called to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. He had a very clear calling and well of course he'd also had a very personal encounter with God. Sometimes I wish God would send me an e-mail and say 'O.k. Amelia, here it is!!' But then of course, that would probably freak me out, or I would delete it believing it to be just another e-mail hoax. I guess the struggle is a good thing.   Oh also, I've gotten a few comments on my American Idol video!! That was so much fun. I think I'll have to post more videos. My video went in the mail today, along with a million other people's too I'm sure! he he. It was fun nonetheless.  Well, I think I need to go find some chamomile or something. Otherwise I'll be pulling an all nighter!!  ...be this way!               "
"                  So Sad   Today was one of those days where I felt like I really didn't get anything done. I think it's because I didn't sleep very well last night. Last night was the first night we slept on our new mattress, and it's sooo comfortable! I kept waking up throughout the night and thinking, 'wow this is so comfortable!' I have no idea why I kept waking up though! I must have been concerned about whether the new mattress would work out or not so I think I kept waking up to make sure I was really comfortable...or something! So I was kind of groggy today.  Well, it was a sad night on American Idol tonight. George went home. I knew he wouldn't win, but I was hoping he'd make it to the last three. He's such a friendly guy. I hope he gets a recording contract. I'll miss his big smile. I'm hoping the final 2 are LaToya and Fantasia. In other news, Ryan Seacrest has his own show -  urlLink Ryan on Air  - and he's looking for American Idol Superfans. He's giving 2 tickets each week to the results show until the end. So I made a silly little video to send in. Click below to view my video!! (You need Windows Media Player)   urlLink Amelia's an American Idol Superfan!!   ...you're such a sad eyed girl.               "
"                  Look out here we come!   It's not often that I read something so funny that I laugh til I cry. Today was one of those rare moments. I received my new issue of Today's Christian Woman and one article titled 'Been there survived that' had me in stitches. Unfortunately, TCW still has last month's magazine posted on their site, but if I ever see that article show up I'll link to it. This author gave her top 10 mothering tips. She has 2 busy boys now aged 10 and 8 and her stories were so hilarious I was crying. I think what made it so funny was all I could think of was Ked and his brothers Kurt and Ken. Her stories sounded an like the stunts those three would pull (or sometimes what Ked pulled on the twins!) and as I read this lady's story I kept thinking of those 3 at that age. It's a good thing my mother-in-law has a good sense of humor. I'm sure that helped keep her sane.  Another funny story is our mattress was delivered today. Well, I suppose it's not funny that they delivered it, but the rest of the story is funny. After they left I'm eyeing the mattress. We went from a normal mattress to a pillow top. For those of you who haven't seen the awesome bed frame Ked and his Dad built, our bed sits pretty high. We have 6 huge drawers under each side of the bed and we designed it so the bed sat about hip level. Well this new mattress is at LEAST twice as thick as the old one, so it now sits a couple inches higher than my waist. I now have to take a few steps back and get a running start to jump into bed!! I'm just kidding...kind of...I do have to do a little hop to get on top! I called Ked this afternoon and said 'Ummmm, honey, I think we're going to have to get a stepping stool so I can get into bed!!' It's really funny, but it looks great. In fact, I need to finish this up so I can go to bed. I can't wait to sleep on it!  Tonight Ked and I had our TV graphics class at the Public Access station. I mentioned that probably a month ago how we were working to get certified to produce tv shows. It was a lot of fun tonight because the class was just the two of us since two others didn't show. It was easy and we now have our graphics certification. Our next class is next week and it's on editing. We're still tossing around ideas for a program, but we think we're narrowing it down.  In other not so cool news, I think I have the hives! I haven't had hives since I was in the first grade (I was allergic to my teacher!). I don't know why I have them, but I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. Every day for about the past couple weeks, I wake up with itchy spots of little bumps and a rash like surrounding it. Today upon examining them I'm pretty sure it's hives; it's definitely not bug bites. It's usually been just a small spot and is mostly gone by afternoon, but today I woke up and had a lot more than usual of them on both arms and my neck, and although they went down this afternoon they're still there and slightly itchy tonight. Ked and I've been racking our brain and neither of us can think what might be causing them. I haven't changed any of my laundry products, or my diet, and I'm not stressed. They show up every morning, so today I washed everything on our bed - the mattress pad and sheets and pillows. It's weird. Any ideas??  Anyway, I'm taking my itchy self to bed!! buh-bye!               "
"                  Strawberry Shortcake - the food not the doll   In my mind I always knew that summer was here when strawberry shortcake was for dessert! I like to buy a flat of strawberries every year to freeze and enjoy throughout the year. I was afraid that I had missed my chance since we have an earlier season down here. Yesterday I discovered a great farmer's market and was delighted to see flats of strawberries! I picked up one and we had strawberry shortcake for dessert! As I was making the biscuits for the strawberries, I was thinking about how I felt like such a Northerner! I guess I never thought of myself as a Yankee growing up, and I never thought of Florida as a southern state. Florida was just a state in the south where all the northerners who were tired of the cold moved to! While that's true - probably 90% of the people we meet moved here from a northern state - Florida is still very much southern. Those who've lived here all their lives have a definite southern accent. It's soda, not pop (someone made fun of me today for saying pop!!) And when it comes to strawberry shortcake they prefer cake over biscuits. I guess being bred in Ohio I do have some southern in me - I prefer sweetened tea, but I'm sticking to my Northern roots. It will always be pop and biscuits for the shortcake!  On another note - yesterday was National Scrapbooking Day! I celebrated by putting all the pages I completed over the past weeks in the new album I bough on Friday. It's also starting to feel like I have a life down here. I went to a baby shower yesterday and we went to a housewarming party today.  Well we're off to another week!               "
"                 Well, I finally made it out of Tampa this morning. Ked and I did enjoy having one more evening together. That makes one less night apart. It was an early morning. 3:00, 4:00, and 5:00 should not come twice in a day! How ironic that Ked took me to the airport at 4 p.m. yesterday and then again at 4 a.m. this morning! Neither one of us got very much sleep last night because we kept waking up afraid we'd miss the alarm! My flights left on time and it was smooth sailing. I had plenty of time in Atlanta and thank God, my luggage was waiting for me in Flint. Took me awhile to find it thanks to the lady behind the counter. I told her that it may have come last night and she told me to wait by the baggage claim and if it didn't show up to come back. So I wait and I'm the last person there and my suitcase isn't there. So I traipse back to the counter and sure enough it was behind the counter. Couldn't she have looked there first and saved me 20 minutes?? Anyway, I was just so thankful to see my suitcase!  Dad was there to pick me up and we made it to Nashville about 12:30. I went straight to bed and slept for about 2 hours! Then I got up took a shower and felt oh so refreshed. I hope I didn't sleep too long that I can sleep well tonight! Of course, I never sleep that well when I'm not with Ked.  It's been nice to see everyone and tonight we had a scrapbooking party. Good times. Well that's all for now!!               "
"                 Well, I should be in a plane headed from Atlanta to Flint. Instead, I'm at home blogging. However, it's quite possible that my suitcase is on a plane headed from Atlanta to Flint! We left here at 4 this afternoon right on schedule, clear blue skies. I checked in and checked my bag and made it through security in a breeze. I get to my gate around 5 pm and we were scheduled to leave at 6:15. At 5:30 these huge rain clouds roll in and it starts to pour, the sky gets pitch black and there is lightning like crazy. As a result, the plane we are supposed to leave on can't land. It circles and circles. 6:00. 6:15. 6:30. They have no idea when it will land or when we'll take off. And I realize that there is no way I will make my connection in Atlanta. I had just an hour in between flights and we were already delayed well over a half hour. And wouldn't you know that was the last flight to Flint for the night. So rather than risk the very possible chance that I would be stuck in Atlanta until 8 a.m. I changed my flight and will now leave at 5:55 am tomorrow. YIKES!! That's early! Five shouldn't come twice in a day!! Well, they were not able to pull my suitcase, and of course this is the first time I packed all my makeup, hair supplies, and overnight goodies in my checked bag. Won't I be lovely tomorrow!! Let's just hope that bag shows up in Flint tomorrow morning!! (The reason I packed all my overnight stuff in my checked bag was so I had room on my carryon for the 2 wedding dresses in case something like this happened. Good call, huh?)  Well, I'm off to bed. It's going to be a short night!!               "
"                 Today is our seventh wedding anniversary. It's just unbelievable how quickly the time has flown by. Like they say, time flies when you're having fun! I can honestly say they have been the best 7 years of my life, and I am looking forward to spending so many more years with the man of my dreams! We were chuckling tonight about the many eras we've been through. We've grown into adulthood together and it's been such a ride! I wouldn't have wanted to share it with anyone other than Ked! After dinner, I was finishing up a project for the trip with Cession and I asked Ked to put in some music for me. He asked what I wanted and I said, 'Something that will keep me awake. I'm exhausted!' He replied, 'I know just the cd and it's probably the only one you know all the words to.' (I'm known for listening to a cd 100 times and still not knowing all the words.) As soon as it started playing I started laughing and was instantly whisked back to 10 months into our marriage. We had just moved to Grand Rapids, and in the process of moving I had fractured my foot. Never stand on the couch to get things off a shelf! Ked had just started working at RBC and I was stuck in the new apartment immobile and most of our stuff was still back in Nashville (Michigan). I spent the day sitting on the living room floor because we didn't have any furniture moved yet. I can't remember what I did all day, because the only thing I remember about that day was I only had one cd to listen to - World Wide Message Tribe. And I listened to it ALL day long. We laughed about that together and reminisced about the years gone by. Then we realized it won't be long - just 7 more years - and we will have spent half our lives together.  Today was an extremely busy day for me and I am exhausted! I started out early taking Ked to work and then running to the bank, the chiropractor, and doing the laundry and cleaning the place up and all before noon!! Then I spent THREE hours this afternoon at Office Depot copying, cutting, and collating this project for the Cession trip. And I forgot to take my cd player and headphones! My brain was fried by the time I left there and I was exhausted! The employees kept glancing at me sideways I'm sure wondering if I was ever going to leave!! Anyway, I'm very happy that I got it all done and it's packed away in my suitcase. Then after dinner Ked and I worked on my suitcases making everything fit. I've never packed for 4 weeks before! He's a master packer and thanks to him I didn't even have to sit on the suitcase to get it closed!  Well, I am soooo tired I am sure I will sleep really well tonight, which is good because I haven't slept well the past few nights. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to blog while I'm gone. I should have access at the in-laws and at my parents house. Unless I run into a random open signal in Traverse I'll probably be off all next week. But hey, you never know! I found an open signal in Anchorage!               "
"                 First of all, help me in welcoming Karon back to the land of blogging! Now that she doesn't have two jobs and a super crazy schedule, she has re-joined us! You can find her over at  urlLink On the Jazz .  Church was great this morning. The pastor is working through a series based on John Eldredge's book  urlLink 'Waking the Dead.'  I think I'm going to need to go pick up a copy of that book and take it with me to read on my trip. Speaking of books, I bought the  urlLink 'Glorious Appearing,'  the final installment in the  urlLink Left Behind  series last week at Wal-Mart. I got it for $10 off the cover price which made me very happy. Anyway, it's been all I could do to not start reading it! I'm saving it for the plane ride up to Michigan on Tuesday. And yes, the way I read I very well could read the whole thing on the plane!! I brought it home and immediately put it in my carryon hoping I would forget about it. I know that once I start it I won't be able to put it down and then I'd have to buy another book to take with me. So far, it's working.  We had another great thunderstorm come through this afternoon. This time of year you can almost set your watch by these summer afternoon storms. Ked and I were kind of sleepy to begin with, so we snuggled up under a blanket together for a nap during the storm. As we drifted into the land of dreams Ked said, 'This is what you're supposed to do during a storm.' I love hanging out with my best friend!!               "
"                 Today was one of those lazy, boring Saturdays. We slept in a little late, then did a little cleaning. Ked then watched a few rounds of PBS - This Old House, New Yankee Woodshop, and we watched this cheesy 80's movie 'My Science Project.' Strange.  Anyway, I then decided to be un-boring and pulled out my sewing machine to see what I could do. Six hours later, I have created a little sachet from the extra length I cut off from the dress for Shelley's wedding and nice tan purse for myself from some leftover material from cargo pants I made a couple months ago. I must say they both turned out quite nice! On the little sachet to go with the formal I found a strand of faux pearls to use for the handle and a nice clear button for a clasp. On the tan purse I thought I'd put a hemp trim lined with shells that I saw at JoAnn's a week ago. Ked ran out and got the trim (and some popcorn and whoppers) since he was bored. I'm quite pleased with how they both turned out!  It was blazing hot out then this afternoon we got another nice thunderstorm. I've never seen as much lighting as we have down here. After the storm it really cooled off and we went outside to look at the sky. In one direction it was green, in another direction the clouds looked twisty and close to the ground. It was kind of spooky and we ran back inside to turn on the tv and look for tornado warnings. Haven't heard any yet!               "
"                 Welcome more bloggers to our universe! Ked's Dad has joined us over at  urlLink King of the Road ! I'm sure you'll find his blog filled with stories of the Rhodes on the Roads! Also our long lost friend (well he wasn't really lost, we knew where he was, we just hadn't been in touch for a long time!)Ryan has joined us. Check him out at  urlLink Stuff & Junk.  If you ever want crazy stories about Ked from high school, Ryan is the one to talk to!  Today has been a lazy day. Ked had a meeting that took up most of his day, so I hung out here by myself. I decided that it would be a great day to hang out by the pool. Surprisingly, I don't do that very often. I guess I just really don't want skin cancer. So I lathered up with sunscreen, grabbed a few scrapbook magazines and a notebook and headed down. I was pleasantly surprised to have the pool all to myself. Another lady came down later but she was quite content to lay there and sleep. I got all caught up on my magazines in between swimming laps when I got too hot. I even jotted down a few ideas for my 2004 scrapbook. About noon I headed back up to the apartment for some lunch. And then headed back down to the pool around 1 for another hour.  Ked came home around 3 and we vegged for awhile before falling asleep together on the couch....ahhh...a nice summer afternoon nap! I'm sure we won't do much tonight, and this weekend I'll be wrapping up a few things getting ready to leave on Tuesday afternoon. I'm having separation anxiety already. I'm not excited about being apart from Ked for 2 1/2 weeks! That's the longest we've been apart since we've been married. At least we'll both be keeping busy during that time and we have free cell phone minutes between our 2 phones!  Well right now supper is in the oven and smelling soooo good!!               "
"                 Today was another busy day. I always like Thursdays. My ladies Bible study always offers great encouragement and fellowship and today was no exception. It was weird to leave this morning and tell them I'd see them in a month. It's strange to think I'll be gone for almost 4 weeks. That's a long time!  Anyway, our Life Group was cancelled tonight which was a bummer. Our leaders are out of town and I guess everyone else was just busy or didn't want to come so they cancelled it. So it will be a really long time before I see everyone from there again.   We had a really loud thunderstorm come through tonight. It was kind of scary! It was so loud and shook our building. We think we must have been directly hit a few times. We lost power briefly like 3 times in a row. When it was over our internet wasn't working and we've boiled it down to two things - Ked's ethernet card and the router. They very well both might be fried. That's about par for the course right now. Ked's whole computer is on a crash course for the dumpster. The monitor is hissing and the computer crashes like every 10 minutes. This is very frustrating for him to get any work done! The machine needs a complete overhaul, but I'm not sure that will be happening too soon, unfortunately!  Well, I'm exhausted! Getting up early 2 days in a row is way too much for me! I hope the Watermark crew lets me go to bed early and sleep in on their trip!!               "
"                 Ked got  his haircut tonight and it's short!! He posted pictures on his  urlLink blog .  My days are getting all mixed up again! I took Ked in today and had a chiropractor appointment this afternoon. I'm feeling better already! The Dr. was really nice. I waited waaaay too long to go in. I just get so nervous about going to a new Dr. office! But it all turned out o.k!  So I'm halfway packed for my trip next week. I've even stashed away some food in the freezer for Ked. At least I know there will be a few nights he won't be eating macaroni & cheese, frozen burritos and pizza! Ked and N8 were chuckling at me last night because I've already started packing and I'm always prepared. People always ask me how I stay organized and get so much done. I should work up Amelia's 10 steps to getting things done. When I think about it, there really is a thought process that goes into it. It's just so natural to my personality that most times I don't consciously think about it.  Right now I'm thinking about going to bed. These days of getting up early wear me out!                "
"                 Ked took a short version of the Meyers-Briggs personality test online. You'll have to read his  urlLink blog  for today. I posted my results in his comments. We couldn't be much more opposite! It's funny and we've laughed at it over the years. It's amazing how well we work together and how we've learned to balance each other. We make a pretty good team if you ask me. We were laughing at it over dinner, because my percentages are always pretty high. I told him, 'Well they ask such obvious questions. Like 'are you organized?' Duh, yeah! 'Are you spontaneous?' No way!' Yeah that would be me. I leave to go up north a week from today and I've already started packing!!  Not much else going on today. I finished another sewing project today. I'm on a roll! Unfortunately, now I've run out of fabric. Uhmmm...yeah. So I stayed busy all day but now I can't remember what I did. I guess it was one of those routine forgettable days. I think I'll get back to my suitcase...               "
"                 When I was in elementary school, there were three things I wanted to be when I grew up -an ice skater, a teacher, and an astronaut. I ended up doing none of those things. In fact, I can barely stand up on ice skates! But it sounds like the dream of traveling in space  might still be attainable! Have you heard of the  urlLink Ansari X Prize ? It's a foundation promoting the private development of affordable space travel. The first team to take a craft that seats three people 62 miles up and repeats the feat within 2 weeks wins $10 million. As  urlLink CNN  noted, 'It's a contest to promote the development of a low-cost, efficient craft for space tourism in the same way prize competitions stimulated commercial aviation in the early 20th century.' And this morning, history was made when 62 year old Mike Melville took SpaceShip One 62.5 miles up and into space. Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, put up $20 million to help Burt Rutan and his company  urlLink Scaled Composites  accomplish this feat. Wouldn't that be so cool to someday take a family vacation to the moon? This is the stuff we read and see in science fiction, yet this time it's for real!  So in personal news, today was rather uneventful. Monday is always laundry and cleaning day. That takes up most of the day unfortunately! I did make it to the pool this afternoon. My back has been hurting a little the past couple days and it feels good to swim. I set a chiropractor appointment for Friday. I haven't been since we moved. *sigh* Another new doctor. Another round of nerves. I think it's just the unknown of a new dr's office that works me up. At least the lady on the phone sounded nice.  I thought I'd do something new and share a recipe with you. Hey that rhymes! I'm a poet and didn't know it! I made this salad tonight and it was unbelievably awesome! This came from the Jul/Aug 2000 Quick Cooking Magazine. Enjoy!   Summer Spinach Salad  1/2 cup vegetable oil (I use canola oil) 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cider or red vinegar (I used red vinegar, yummy!) 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar (I used Splenda, much healthier) 1-1/2 teaspoons ground mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds 8 cups torn fresh spinach 3 green onions, sliced 2 pints fresh strawberries, sliced 3 large ripe bananas, cut into 1/2 inch slices (I only used 1 banana cut more thinly and it was plenty) 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted  Place the first 6 ingredients in a blender or food processor, cover and process until the sugar is dissolved. Add the poppy seeds; process just until blended. In a salad bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Drizzle with dressing, toss to coat. Serve immediately. Yield: 14 servings, or 2 REALLY large and yummy servings for 2 people!! =)               "
"                 Happy Father's Day, especially to my Dad! I had a fun chat with him on the phone today. That's always good. I'm looking forward to seeing my parents in 3 weeks. I'll be spending an entire week with them. That will be the first time I've done that since I got married 7 years ago!  Church was awesome this morning and the pastor did a great talk on the heart of a man. He pointed out that the father is the main identity shaper in a child's life. For boys the father needs to answer the question 'Do I have what it takes?' And for girls he needs to answer the question 'Am I lovely?' Pastor then ran down a laundry list of things that a father needs to be. He topped it off with, 'And if you had a dad who was all those things AND he is a follower of Christ, you need to be calling him and thanking him today, because you are in the minority.' As we pulled out of the parking lot Ked and I discussed, as we have many times before, how thankful we are for our dads. Not only are they everything on that laundry list, they both also have a strong faith in Christ which they passed down to us. Ked and I often discuss how thankful we are that we carried very little baggage into our marriage. That definitely gave us a solid foundation to build our marriage on. It also gives us the confidence that some day we will be totally awesome parents as well. So thanks, Dad!!                 "
"                 The past couple days have been fun, hanging out with my hun!! I've been all mixed up on my days this week. My Grandma warned me when we moved here that would happen! It started on Wednesday when I took Ked to work and ran my errands. I usually take him in on Thursdays so I thought Wednesday was Thursday and that Thursday was Friday, and now with Ked having Fridays off, Friday feels like Saturday, and Saturday feels like a 2nd Saturday!! Hmmm...  Anyway, yesterday we hung out here for most of the day. I ran a bunch of errands and got my haircut. The big thing is that I managed to get all of my alterations done on the dress for Shelley's wedding. Whew! With a few tips from my mom it turned out to be easier than I thought. That feels good to have that done since I leave in 10 days!!  We started out slowly this morning, well actually I did a little more sewing this morning and made a skirt! After lunch we headed over to Orlando just to see what we could see. We had a blast just driving around and checking out parts of town we've never been to before. We found a Logan's Roadhouse and we were so excited! It's the first one we've seen down here, so we hadn't been to one since we moved! We celebrated our anniversary 9 days early and had dinner there. We then topped it off with a piece of Key Lime pie from Pebbles, a restaurant we discovered in January. They have the absolute BEST key lime pie ever!! We've been thinking about that pie ever since then! I think I even dreamt about it last night...it was oh so delicious!!  So our 2 Saturdays were just awesome. There's nothing we enjoy more than just being together. Even if we're each working on projects, as long as we're together.                "
"                 Tonight I wish that I were more eloquent or poetic. I wish I could in some beautiful way explain what God did today, or at least that you could sit next to me and hear the emotion in my voice as I tell the story of His greatness.   I started out early again this morning dropping Ked off at work. I then headed to my ladies Bible study, not really expecting much. The summer series is a lot more laid back, and I even told someone this morning that it had been a little boring but that I was going for the fellowship. I had no idea what God had in store this morning. Each week a different lady from the study has been teaching and this week Debbie spoke on the Woman at the Well. She did a wonderful job and it was evident that God had spoken to her. She is part of a group of ladies that I have been watching over the past few months. This group of Godly women are most definitely filled with the Holy Spirit and they know how to pray. I've always wanted to be more like them - more passionate in my prayers and more in tune with the Holy Spirit. At the end of her teaching she said that she had felt God calling her to wash our feet, and invited whoever was willing to come sit in a chair at the front so she could serve us in this way. She had several other ladies helping her by drying the feet and anointing them with oil while the pastor's wives joined her in laying hands on each lady and praying specifically for them. There were about 30 women there this morning, and I was uncomfortably conscious of the fact that I was sitting in the very front. One by one I watched the women go forward and saw the Holy Spirit touch their soul. Prayers for healed marriages, restored relationships, and bondages to be broken. As I sat and watched it became evident that great things were going to happen in the lives of these women thanks to the humble servant's heart of the precious ladies so willing to be God's vessel. I continued to sit and the battle of pride waged in my heart. I don't like to get publicly emotional. I don't like to admit that I need help. Yet the Holy Spirit started to remind me of things. He started speaking to me, 'Humble yourself. Let these ladies serve you. They are my servants. They know me. Allow them to pray for you.' Then I remembered several conversations with Ked recently where we discussed how badly we need people praying for us,  really  praying for us. I knew what I needed to do. I slowly slid out of my seat and inched my way into an empty seat. Debbie came and poured the water over my feet, and then held them as she began to pray for me. Debbie doesn't know me. I'm not sure she even knows my name. We've chit-chatted a little over the weeks, but not a lot. As she began to pray for me, I was amazed. She way saying things to God about me and praying for me in ways that ONLY the Holy Spirit could have told her to say. When she finished praying, she looked up at me with a look of almost awe. In that instant before she spoke, I could tell by the look on her face that she had heard from God. Still holding my feet, she looked me in the eyes and said, 'Girl, He's really loving on you!' I'm not sure if my jaw dropped open or not, but only God knew how desperately I needed to hear those words. Only God knows how many conversations Ked and I have had lately wondering...does He care? Do all these little details of our lives matter? We know in our heads that they do, but sometimes after you've walked so many miles after so many years your heart forgets the incredible depths of His love for us. It gets lost in the details of life and trying to figure out what His plan is and trying not to miss it and on and on. But to hear confirmation from a Godly woman, 'He's really loving on you,' to know that yes, He is completing the work He started in me...words are not eloquent enough...               "
"                 Well I am happy to report that today went quite well, even the visit to the Dentist! The day started much earlier than I'm used to since I had to take Ked to work. We had absolutely NO food in the house, so we swung through McDonald's for breakfast. What a shame! I love those McGriddles. Then it was off to my dentist appointment. And my stomach was all in knots. My last experience there wasn't pleasant and I had the most miserable cleaning in my whole life. This time however was much better! I had a different lady and I mean I was in and out!! It was the easiest and fastest cleaning I've ever had. She said everything looked great and healthy and good job! I was so excited, and relieved!! After that I headed to the grocery, since we had no food in the house. I dread grocery shopping, especially on the BiG week. I have grocery shopping down to a rhythm. Every other week is a BiG shopping week - you know when the only thing left in the cupboard is those cans of cream corn and your spices! Then the other week is a light shopping week where I'm just refilling fresh vegetables and meat. So I had a list a mile long today and it's such a chore. Up and down the aisles, back and forth. When I walked into the Super Wal-Mart I was pleasantly surprised at how un-crowded it was. That place is always a zoo no matter what time of day you go! So I was happy to not be running into people as I maneuvered through the aisles. Then a true miracle happened. I found a completely empty line to check out! That NEVER happens. And the cashier was as friendly as all get out. I walked out of Wal-Mart wondering if there was like a halo surrounding me because all my unpleasant activities had gone so well!!  After all that running around I headed home, unloaded the groceries and had some lunch. By that time it was 2 p.m. and I was thinking about starting to work on that dress I need to alter. Then I suddenly realized I was REALLY tired! The next thing I knew it was 4:30 and I had slept for 2 1/2 hours and I had to go pick up Ked!!  Anyway, I'm thankful it all went so well today. God definitely paved the way. Now I need to go to bed because tomorrow I have Bible study and a haircut!  P.S. - How bout those Pistons? That's what I'm talkin bout!!               "
"                 My fellow bloggers must be having boring days because no one is writing very much lately! Unless you're SupaK and N8 who  claim  to be super busy...excuses! SupaK did write a pretty funny blog today though. He told a story on himself that I was going to tell, but it's much funnier from his point of view. You'll have to  urlLink read  it!  Well, my past few days have been a little boring too, but I'm not complaining because the next few weeks are going to get crazy. I got my dress for Shelley's wedding today. It is very nice! It's going to take some creative sewing to get it to fit right. Oh to be a perfect size 6! HA!! I'm quite a little seamstress in case you didn't know, but I'm nothing compared to my Momma. So I did what every reasonable daughter does when perplexed by a problem - 'MOM!!! HELP!!' Fortunately in these days of technology my Mom is only a cell phone call away and she knew exactly what I would need to do with my dress. So I'll be spending the next few days working on that!  I've also been working to catch up on my writing lessons. I'd like to finish 2 more in the 2 weeks before I leave for Michigan. I feel like I'm starting to get in the groove and things are starting to come together. I am quite excited to see what doors will open over the next year. I have no idea where this will end up, but I'm excited about the possibilities!  Well I'd love to stay up and watch the rest of the Pistons game, but I have an early morning tomorrow thanks to a dentist appointment. YUCK!! This is the most I've ever dreaded going to the dentist. You know how much I don't like doctor offices to begin with, and I did NOT like my last experience at this office. I think after tomorrow we'll be looking for a different dentist. Sigh. It will be over soon.               "
"                 How familiar are you with the flag code?? Did you know that the flag is to be displayed on all days, but especially days such as New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Mother's Day (no mention of Father's Day, sorry!) and the birthdays of the States? Did you know that the flag is never to be used for advertising purposes or printed or embroidered on items that are meant for temporary use and discard such as napkins or boxes? Also, the flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart. Know your flag code! Check it out at  urlLink http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/ch1.html    Along patriotic lines, I found some pictures that my Grandpa Roger took of President Reagan in 1980 when he was campaigning in my hometown Lima, Ohio.                        "
"                 With all of the discussion regarding President Reagan over the past week, all the stories surrounding the Lightning's Stanley Cup win, the NBA Finals, and the increasing coverage of the upcoming Olympics, I've been thinking a lot about heroes and champions. I've been inspired as I've watched these athletes persevere under incredible physical and emotional pain to emerge as Champions. I've gathered a few of my thoughts from the stories of the Stanley Cup Champions to put together a profile of the heart of a champion.   Champions persist despite the odds  Many people believed that hockey didn't belong in Florida twelve years ago when the Lightning were founded. Florida?? The sunshine state?? No way. Hockey is for Canada, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. Tampa won't be a hockey town! The team first played in a barn at the Florida State Fairgrounds, and then later on a slushy rink at a baseball field. The franchise nearly went under with various ownership, management, and coaching changes, including one manager who made over 70 player changes in one year. Just four years ago, the Lightning were at the bottom of the division that was the bottom of all divisions. You couldn't get any lower.  Yet the powers of hockey continued to believe the Lightning could one day succeed. Bill Davis, the owner of the Pistons had enough faith and bought the team. A new manager full of fire and life was brought in, and a new coach began to breathe life back into these weary players.  The team recruited Dave Andreychuk and with the urging of his wife he landed in Tampa. Andreychuk was the veteran the team needed. Twenty-two years into his NHL career, he still had not kissed a Stanley Cup. Naysayers were constantly giving him grief, reminding him of his age and that he might not ever see that Cup. Still, he and the Bolts persisted. Dave brought a father figure to the team and the leadership they so desperately needed.  Five games into the finals, things still didn't look good. The Bolts were down 3-2, and only 5 teams in 60 years had ever come back to fin the final two games when down 3-2.  Champions never believe the odds or the statistics, and continue to pursue what they know in their heart they are called to do.   Champions lean into the pain  Personal pain? Forget it. Champions press on. During Game 2 of the finals, Dan Boyle's house burned down, leaving over $300,000 in damage. He continued to play every game, borrowing a teammates clothes.  Doctors commented how they could barely get the final stitch into the players' heads during game time injuries before they were on their feet ready to get back into the game.  The NHL employs the longest season of all the professional sports, and it is also one of the most physical games. The players were bruised, stitched, and beat up, yet they continued to play day after day over 100 games with rarely 2 days in between games.  Champions ignore the pain, lean into it, and continue to play. The prize is worth so much more than the pain.   Champions always believe  From day one of this season, they claimed that 'safe is death' and played all year for the championship. After losing game 5 at home, and now in that horrible position of being down 3-2 they told the arena administrative and janitorial staff on the way out the door 'we'll see you here Monday for game 7.' They continued to speak the next step, 'we'll have a victory breakfast tomorrow,' claiming each next step they needed to win.  Champions continue to believe and proclaim that belief through their speech.   Champions know who they are playing for.  The team manager commented on what a privilege it was to work with a group of athletes who were playing for the name on the front of the jersey, not the name on the back of the jersey.   Champions don't pursue individual egos and glory, they are unified in playing for the greater cause of their team and mission.   We are part of a worldwide, eternal championship team that has been  guaranteed  the victory! Let's not get down by the negativity we are surrounded by and remember that we can already proclaim the championship, no matter what the the odds may be in our lives. Lean into the pain remembering that it is just for a season; concentrate on the victory that lies ahead. Continue to believe, and proclaim those victory promises God has spoken. And most of all,  always  remember that you aren't playing for the glory of your own name on the back of the jersey.               "
"                 Welcome another blogger to the world of blogging Mom (Vicky). Check her out at  urlLink www.vicky.ailema.com .  I'm really tired today and should be in bed, but I came home from Life Group and watched the Pistons annihilate the Lakers in the last half of the Finals Game 3. That was awesome!! It's even more awesome the way the media has been drooling over the L.A. team. What cracked me up was to hear that 200 Pistons fans had stood on top of a parking garage across the street from the Laker's hotel last night and screamed for an hour starting at 11 p.m. to rattle the Lakers and keep them from getting sleep. A parade of cars also kept driving around the block and honking, until finally the police came and called it off. And that's why we love Detroit!  Life Group was awesome tonight. Ked stayed home because he wasn't feeling well. He was kind of shaky and weak. I think it may have been something he ate for lunch. He's feeling a little better now. Anyway, we're still going through Romans in Life Group, we will be for awhile, and I just love this study. Romans is such a foundational book of the Bible, and no matter how many times you've heard the salvation story, as Paul walks you through it chapter by chapter it just makes me even more joyful and amazed at the incredible love God had for me when I was still His enemy. I've been trying to wrap my mind around His grace lately, and it just continually blows me away. My mind is too human small to truly get it. That's why I think Heaven is going to be so amazing. It won't be the streets of gold or our crowns, it will be finally, truly seeing God and understanding fully Who He is. I'm shaking just thinking about it.               "
"                 I have been fascinated with the pomp and circumstance of President Reagan's funeral. This is the first Presidential state funeral to take place in my lifetime. I have seen pictures of Kennedy's processional with the caison and riderless horse, but watching it live today was quite powerful. The respect and dignity given to this great man by millions across the world is awe-inspiring.  What has most captured my attention over the past week has been President & Mrs. Reagan's marriage. What a graceful, kind, loving woman she is. During the state funeral today, all of the speakers spoke highly of their marriage. What a testimony that is to all of us to see such a strong, faithful, devoted couple. One of the speakers said that Mrs. Reagan's career was her husband. That was a profound statement, and an example to all married women. If we were to take our marriage that seriously, and see it as our career, a God-given one at that, how much stronger our family units would be and how much more empowered our husbands would be. In her biography on  urlLink www.whitehouse.gov  she is quoted saying 'A woman's real happiness and real fulfillment come from within the home with her husband and children.' That's not a statement you hear too often these days!               "
"                 We all make mistakes - but I'd be surprised if this one didn't cost someone their job. I mean, it's only the biggest event in Tampa since the Bucs won the Superbowl!! The  urlLink Tampa Tribune  published the  urlLink WRONG editorial  this morning and that was almost as big of news as the Bolts bringing home the Stanley Cup. The Trib had prepared 2 editorials in advance - one for the Bolts winning, and one if they lost. And you guessed it, they published the one for if they lost, and now the Trib is the laughingstock of the town, with all the local t.v. stations and a few national outlets covering their big OOOPS!! Where's the quality checks??               "

"                 Unbelievable!! We just witnessed history as the Tampa Bay Lightning just won the Stanley Cup for the first time. Hockey has come a long way when a Florida team wins the cup! It was a nailbiter game, and we decided to stay home and watch rather than join the mayhem downtown. Not only was the arena sold out at over 22,000, but thousands others watched on big screens outside the forum. St Pete Times Forum is just a few blocks from UT where Ked works, but we decided to avoid the craziness and watch the game at home. There is madness in the streets tonight!!               "
"                 You would think from all my posts lately that we're quite the sports fans. We're not really, but we do have our favorites - the Pistons, of course, will always be the 'home team' and the Yankees are just, well, cool, and now the Lightning - how can you not get swept away?? Well the Pistons just picked up game 1 in L.A. The last time I watched the Pistons in the finals against the Lakers it was 1989 and I was 12 and Isaiah Thomas and the Bad Boys picked up the title. That brings back memories, watching the games with Dad and Jason, thinking how cool Thomas was, and watching Magic and Kareem go down!! Basketball is the only sport that I fully understand. I understand turnovers, steals, the paint, and traveling. It is a little less exciting than hockey, I have to admit I enjoy the shoving, but in b-ball that's a foul.   So tonight I learned that the same man,  urlLink Bill Davidson , owns the Pistons and the Lightning. I'd say it's been a great year for him! Hopefully, it will be a REALLY great year for him with 2 teams winning titles!  I am saddened at the passing of President Reagan. As I've been hearing about all the pomp and circumstance planned for his funeral, I realized that this is the first President to die during my lifetime. The last President to die was Johnson in 1973. I remember when Reagan came to my hometown Lima, Ohio. We drove down the street and stood by the train tracks and cheered with our neighbors as his train went by. My grandparents took my brother out to the airport and my Grandpa got some pretty good pictures of the President. That seems like a lifetime ago.               "
"                 Friday night we called Grandma Louise to see if she was busy on Saturday. We had the day free and thought it would be a great time to go visit her. The day started off a little rough when I accidentally squished 2 of Ked's fingers in the car window! I was rolling the windows up and he was getting in the car and somehow got his fingers caught! I felt so bad!! Fortunately we got ice on them and by the end of the day they weren't even black and blue. He got me back later though, I'll tell you about that in a minute.  So we headed down to Sarasota and caught a little rain on the way there. We got there just in time for lunch and had a nice visit with Grandma at a nearby sandwich shop. By the time we were done with lunch the sky had cleared and we decided to head to the beach and look for shark's teeth! We got to the beach and it was pretty empty, thanks to the earlier rain. But there also weren't many teeth to find. The tide was coming in, so we just decided to enjoy a nice leisure walk on the beach. It's amazing how listening to the waves and squishing the sand between your toes can just wash away all that worries you. It's like nothing else in the world matters. What bills? What job??  The farther down the beach we walked, the more interesting the people we encountered. Ked said 'Hey Amelia!' and pointed for me to look. I turned my head and was assaulted with a full view of a sagging old man in a G-string!! ahhhh disgusting!! Ked just started cracking up. By the third time he pulled this trick on me (I'm a slow learner!) I figured it out and quit looking. I guess that was paybacks for his fingers earlier.  We walked about a mile and a half down the beach and then started to encounter some decent teeth. It's amazing how addicting the hunt can be! Ked found himself a nice spot and started digging and pulled up some nice teeth! After awhile we headed back, so we walked about 3 miles and it took 3 hours. What a life!!  Grandma then treated us to some ice cream at Nokomis Groves. You just can't beat that chocolate/lime twist. We headed back to Grandma's all relaxed and hung out there for a little while longer looking through her boxes of teeth and shells. She helped me fix up a little box and a couple bags for me to give to some cool kids this summer. We enjoy hanging out with Grandma.  We headed home and turned on the tv just in time to catch the last 2 periods and the double overtime of the Bolts game. Unbelievable!! I still can't believe they won and pushed it into game 7 back here in Tampa. They haven't won 2 games in a row since the middle of April, so it will be interesting to see if they can pull it off!               "
"                 Well, I figured it was about time that I got on board with the new blogger system and updated my look. Do you like it? As you can see, I also changed my website to www.amelia.ailema.com. Please change the links on your blogs and in your bookmarks. I was quite bored this afternoon, so this is the result! Ked and I were talking about going to the pool, but we talked for too long and we had a thunderstorm come through, although it didn't really rain much. It was all talk.  Nothin much going on today. I'm trying not to get bored again. I think I need to go to Wal-Mart and get some pictures printed so I can scrapbook. I'm having withdrawals. Since I ran out of pictures I'm realizing how much that hobby keeps me sane and un-bored (is that a word??) When I get bored it's like my brain shuts down. Then everything Ked suggests sounds boring and I have no motivation to do anything not even read or write or blog. I used to drive my Mom nuts when I was bored, and I learned to quit telling her I was bored because she would dream up work for me to do, and it was never fun!  ok, well now I'm bored, so I'm going to go be bored...or something.

"                 Good Community  Well  urlLink Kurt  has finally made his first post! It was getting quite funny because there was a whole discussion happening on his comments before he ever even posted. He had to come in and take control of his own blog. Quite amusing!!  I love Thursdays. I think I say that quite often. It's a busy refreshing day filled with great community experiences for me. This morning I headed to our Ladies Bible study, and I was anxious to see everyone because it had been about 3 weeks. Last week we had a break and the week before that Kurt & Michelle were here. It's just refreshing to be in the company of ladies who love God with all their heart, soul, and mind. I had a couple great discussions today and one of them was with a dear friend and she was affirming a lot of things that Ked and I have been struggling with lately. We had a little discussion on how we're (and by we're meaning a general statement about local churches) encouraging casual Christians. If you read  urlLink Ked's post on Community with a Po!nt , he was touching on the same topic and we've had several conversations with different people as of late. By not expecting anything of people, we're breeding a generation of casual Christians where it's easy to go to church, go to lifegroup and make it social, but not making and encouraging personal and spiritual growth and discipline. Another wise lady also discussed this morning how we've come to rely on the local church for things it was never meant to fulfill - such as depending on it solely for our spritual growth and maturity. Anyway, there's a lot of thoughts rumbling around there, but it's just nice to know we're not alone.  Then this evening we had another great Life Group session. We're going through the book of Romans and we're all thoroughly enjoying it. How can you not? When you open up the Word and God speaks so clearly through the written word and the Holy Spirit, how can you not get excited? Romans is so foundational to our faith, and it has been so great to get back to the basics of our need for salvation and the role faith plays. The exciting thing is we know we're just getting started - we're only on chapter 4. Then we sent the guys off to another room and in our smaller groups shared prayer requests and we took some good time sharing. I love that time when people open up to the struggles in their life and what God is teaching them, or admitting where they need to grow. It's so important to have a group of people like that who you know will pray for you and genuinely care. It was just an incredibly refreshing day.  And now I am exhausted and need to go bed! I actually fell asleep checking my e-mail before Life Group! That was quite funny. I haven't fallen asleep at my computer since my last job...oh did I just say that??               "
"                  When Blogging Has Gone tooooo Far!!     Happy Birthday Karon!! !  Hope you had a good day, can't wait to see you soon!! It was great to chat with you.  Today was rather uneventful which is ok by me! It was a phonecall day. I chatted with Karon and Jenn for quite awhile and then did some job hunting for Ked. Worked out again today, but no crazy guy in the workout room today.  Speaking of the crazy guy in the workout room yesterday, this is really funny! After dinner Ked and I were veggin on the couch laughing and chatting about something and I mentioned something about the workout guy yesterday. Ked said 'What guy in the workout room?' I looked at him and said 'Didn't you read my blog from yesterday?' He looked at me and said, 'I guess I didn't. So what happened?' Then without thinking I said, 'Well, you'll have to read my blog!' He laughs and says, 'I live with you, I'm not going to read your blog so I can find out what happened yesterday! You need to just tell me these things!' In that instant I started laughing hysterically and realized that I have taken the blogging thing a little too far when I'm telling my husband that he'll have to read my blog to find out the events of my day to day life! As the absurdity hit me I couldn't stop laughing. When I did settle down, I told him the story, complete with a reenactment and he thought it was quite hilarious. Silly me!  I have been receiving a monthly cd from  urlLink Thrive!  the women's ministry started by John Maxwell's InJoy. Ladies, if you hear that the Thrive! simulcast is coming to a church in your area this November, I highly recommend that you attend. It was an awesome event packed full of great worship and powerful teaching. Anyway, I've been listening to the monthly cd's when I workout. Each month they pick a topic, interview someone, give a devotional, and close with a book review. It's a great tool. Today I was listening to the topic of grace and their interview with  urlLink Randy Alcorn . He pointed out something that I'd never thought of in this way before. He said that grace and truth must go together. Grace without truth he said is just tolerance and that's quite different than grace. He said to just say 'whatever' and let people live as they please does them no good and he says the church often fails on this point. He pointed to an experience he had in a small group. After a couple months of meeting, he discovered that one of the couples was not married but had a child and were living together. He and his wife sat down privately to discuss the matter with them in grace and truth and to help them see that what they were doing was not right and bore consequences. This couple, although both believers, had never been told that their lifestyle was wrong and they were surprised that no one had ever helped them with it before. It turns out that finances were an issue, so the small group took up a collection for them and Mr Alcorn conducted the wedding and helped this couple correct their situation so they were no longer living in sin. He also said that truth without grace is not good either. He said especially in raising children you must have both. You can't pound the truth into their heads, you must teach it while also teaching and living grace. He discusses this more in his book  urlLink 'The Grace & Truth Paradox.'  Grace and Truth. What a concept.  One more bit of information! I mentioned this article around Mother's Day and I just saw that it was posted online. It reminded me of Ked, Kurt & Ken and I laughed til I cried every time I read it. I sent the link to my mother-in-law and she replied saying, 'Her #1 tip is the truth, and the one that keeps you sane!' Enjoy!  urlLink Been There, Survived That!                "
"                  Welcome to the Wonderful World of Blogging!   A big hello and welcome to Michelle who just posted her first blog at  urlLink www.michelle.ailema.com !!

He hasn't posted a blog yet though. Keep your eye on him though, I'm sure he will soon, or Ked will broadcast all his nicknames...               "
"                  Quit being stingy and share your rain!   I was walking to our little workout center today and I was noticing how brown our grass is. Then I tried to think of the last time it rained, and I couldn't remember. They are predicting rain over the next few days and I sure hope they are right. Hopefully it will take a little of the humidity out of the air too (not that I'm complaining).  So yes, I'm trying to get back into the habit of working out daily again. I went down to our little workout room today and had it all to myself until the very end when another lady came in. The workout center is broken down into 2 rooms with all the cardio equipment in one room and the weights in the room next to it. When I was walking down the hallway to the cardio room I passed the weight room and started cracking up. There was country music blaring and this guy dancing and singing along trying to be all tough and buff. I glanced into the room a minute later and he was doing a Rocky routine in front of the mirrors. It was hilarious.   Otherwise the day was rather uneventful with the usual cleaning routine. I'm starting to gear up for my trip North. I leave exactly 4 weeks from today, and I have a lot to get ready before then. I know it seems like awhile, but you know me and my organized checklists. Packing for this trip will be a little more work since I'm packing to be in 2 weddings and going on a trip with Watermark.                "
"                 Well the last half of the week flew by! Wednesday and Thursday I worked on Dad's books again and finished up one. The other one I'm just waiting on a few final things from him. I also got back into the gym this week. That felt good. After 4 weeks of being away from my regular diet and exercise routine, it felt great to get back into the swing of things. Thursday evening we headed over to Life Group and had a great time with them as always. It was nice to see everyone again. I hadn't been there in 5 weeks! It was funny to note that in those 5 weeks they only finished 2 lessons, so I wasn't too far behind. I think we're going to be in Romans for a loooong time!  Yesterday Ked and I headed out to Orlando early afternoon. We had planned to attend a free Photoshop seminar that we figured was going to be a three hour sales pitch, but would probably teach us some things about the new version of the software that we didn't know yet. We got to the Orange County Convention Seminar, which is absolutely gorgeous, and discovered they wanted $10-15 for parking. We decided we didn't want to pay $10-15 to park for a free seminar/sales pitch for software we already own. So we skipped it and got an early start on the rest of our plans for the day! We headed down the street to the Pointe. It's a cool little outdoor shopping mall that we had heard about, complete with an upside down building fun house. We grabbed a light lunch at the Dan Marino cafe and then saw a matinee of the Bourne Supremacy. Excellent movie! They tied things up so well, I'm still wondering what they'll do for the third movie.  After the movie we wandered around the strip a little and then headed over to the Premier Outlet stores. We always hear everyone talking about the good deals there. It was another nice outdoor mall, and half the stores aren't really outlet stores, just regular stores. But the ones that are outlet stores had some great deals going on. Florida has had no sales tax for the past week and until August 1st on school supplies and clothing and footwear under $50. Thank you tourists for your money so we don't have to pay state or local income tax and giving us a statewide surplus of funds!! We didn't buy anything, but we did have a great time wandering and noting certain store for future needs. Then we headed home and it took us twice as long as it should have thanks to wonderful I-4. It's 9 p.m. and we're crawling. Go figure. Florida has no clue how to handle road construction. They need to take some lessons from Michigan. Anyway, we had a great all-day date!!  Not too much going on today. I think we'll be running a few errands and hopefully Ked will be building me a little stool so I won't have to jump into bed anymore! =)                "
"                 Well, I spent the majority of today staring at this computer screen. I'm ready to turn it off and head to bed. I got up this morning and started working on two books my  urlLink father-in-law  gave me while we were in Michigan. Over the past year I've become the editor for his self-published booklets for his  urlLink ministry . These latest two he needs ready to take with him to Malaysia and Singapore in a few weeks. He and another long-time family friend and Christian magician, Paul Ricksecker, will be ministering in churches throughout the area as well as teaching at a few conferences. I knew Dad needed these two books ready as soon as possible so I worked on them most of today, and he and I exchanged e-mails throughout the afternoon. I think we should have them all ready by the end of the week. Please pray for Sheldon and Paul as they prepare for this trip that God will guide them as they study and prepare their materials and that He will open&nbsp; many doors to share the gospel, that hearts will be opened, and that as a result of their training the locals will be even more equipped to share God's Word with their neighbors.   Oh - Word to all my Elk Lake homegirls and guys - I gave a cd to Nate last Saturday with all my Elk Lake pictures. Just ask him for a copy if you'd like!   Well, that was my day. It's time to hit the hay! (I'm such a poet!)                   "
"                 Hey, little bigger brother!! Happy Birthday! Hope you had a great day! I can't believe you're getting married before your next birthday!

Where are all the rest of you bloggers??                "
"                 I just posted pictures from  urlLink Kurt &amp; Michelle's wedding ! Make sure you take a good look at their absolutely gorgeous cake!! =) You can also find the link to the pictures on the menu to the right under Living the Po!nt.                 "
"                 Well, SupaK and I made it home safely last night at 9 pm. What a whirlwind the last week was!! Let’s see if I can recap! I'll also try to post some pictures from the wedding later today.  Wednesday – SupaK headed up to Grand Rapids to spend the day with Dave the Fish and then they headed to Spilk’s bachelor party. Sounds like they all had a lot of fun! SupaK then spent the night at Spilk’s with all the other guys. While he was hanging out and having fun, Karon and I spent the day slaving over wedding cakes. I think I smelled and tasted cake and frosting the rest of the week! ALL day long we baked, frosted and decorated SEVEN wedding cakes for the big event on Saturday. I think I finished up around 1 am that night. But it felt good to get most of the cakes done (we just had 2 left to do). The in-law’s don’t have air conditioning and that oven just heated that house right up. Oh my word!! We were roasting by the time dinner came around. We stopped around 5 pm and Karon headed to the rodeo with one of the cousins. Mom and I decided to pick up Aunt Elaine and Johnny and get into some air conditioning for dinner. Before we left I took a shower, and a cold shower never felt sooo good! We had a blast at Applebee’s with Elaine and Johnny. He is 5 and absolutely hilarious! We went to Wal-Mart after dinner and when he discovered the toy section you would think he had never seen a toy store before. He stretched his arms as wide as he could and exclaimed, “Look at this! This is just for kids! This is sooo AWESOME!” We were just cracking up! My favorite was when he proclaimed, again with arms stretched wide, “This is the moment I’ve been waiting for!!”&nbsp; After we dropped them off at Grandma’s Mom and I headed back to the house and I finished up the last 2 cakes. I fell into bed exhausted, and I dreamt about frosting cakes!! AHHH!! I couldn’t even get away from it in my sleep!!  Thursday – I headed up to GR and met up with Heather and Holly for lunch. I chat with them online all the time, but it was so nice to connect in person. Heather brought little Arwen and she is such a sweetie! She just sat there and smiled the whole time. I’m so happy for them! After lunch I hooked up with the SupaK and we headed over to Grand Haven to try to catch the Falcon and family one last time, but we missed them. So we ended up taking a nice walk on the beach and out to the lighthouse. We had been apart for 2 ½ weeks and then ever since Ked had arrived we had been on the go constantly. It was nice to have an hour to hold hands and walk up and down the beach just catching up. Even though the beach was a little dirty and the water was disgustingly black (Ked kept thinking of all the sewage that ran into Lake Michigan this spring due to the flooding!) it was a refreshing time. After our little walk we headed back to GR to catch up with some friends. We had dinner with Chris and Becca and Brian and Julie. We all knew each other from Cornerstone and had a blast catching up. All four of them just got married this spring and we enjoyed looking at their wedding and honeymoon pictures. The time flew by much too quickly, as it always does. Before we knew it we were headed back to Nashville for the final few days of our trip. When we returned home, Aunt Sarah and Aunt Elaine were unloading Sarah’s car and giggling. We knew something was up! The aunts had arrived to save the day and decorate Mom & Dad’s enclosed porch for the dress rehearsal dinner the next evening. They called themselves the “Dollar Store Queens!” Mom, Karon, and I got a kick out of that because we ALL know that Mom and Karon are the dollar store queens by far. Sarah and Elaine haven’t ever drove to Georgia to go to a dollar store. (Ok technically Mom didn’t either, but she made Dad stop at one on their way down to Florida!) They did a fabulous job decorating and had a lot of fun while doing so!  Friday – The last two days of the trip were by far the busiest!!! Friday morning Karon and I got up and put the last 2 cakes in the oven. She and Mom then headed to Lansing to pick up the fresh flowers for the cake and also a few items for the dress rehearsal dinner that evening. While they were shopping I watched the cakes and corralled Ked into helping me with some cleaning. No one can clean a bathroom as well as he does! By the time Mom and Karon returned Ked had cleaned the bathroom and half the house and I had lunch ready, as well as one cake frosted and the other ready to go. It was definitely a teamwork day as we raced to get everything ready for that evening. After lunch Mom worked on finishing the house and Karon and I finished the last 2 cakes and desserts for the dinner, cleaned the kitchen, and vacuumed. Meanwhile, Ked and Dad mowed the lawn! By 5:00 we had the place spick and span and the cakes were all in the fridge ready for tomorrow. We all rushed through the shower and then headed to dress rehearsal at the church. Rehearsal went well and without a hitch. Nate did a good job of keeping things moving! Afterwards we all headed back to Mom & Dad’s for a great pizza dinner from an awesome local pizza shop. We all hung out for awhile and then it was back to work! Kurt printed up the programs for tomorrow while Karon and I folded them. Then we corralled Dad and Ked to help Karon and I while we folded up 200 cake boxes! We managed to get to bed about 1 a.m. for a short night’s sleep before another long day.  Saturday – Kurt & Michelle’s big day finally arrived!! Karon and Kurt worked all morning on the flowers for the cake. Aunt Sarah and Aunt Elaine came over again and I helped them with some flower arrangements for the front of the church. We packed everything up and headed to the reception hall to set up the cake. The big moment….tiering the cakes! We had been nervous about this all week long. Our big 16” cake that was on the bottom had some shifting issues when we iced it. We loaded the cake with wooden dowels and prayed it would hold!! We raced to set it up and I don’t know what we would have done without Sarah and Elaine’s help! When it was all said and done, the cake was absolutely beautiful!! Karon and I took a step back and admired our work and then snapped a million pictures to remember it by! We then rushed off to the church. We were supposed to be there at 1:30 but we didn’t make it until after 2. That gave us just enough time to touch up our makeup and get into our dresses for pictures at 3 p.m.&nbsp; We gathered in the room around Michelle and tried to keep her from crying and messing her makeup before heading down the aisle! She was resplendent and radiant in her dress. It was just a perfect, beautiful day. The sun was shining, the humidity was low, and a nice breeze kept the temperature just perfect. Nate did a fabulous job officiating the ceremony. I think it was the most meaningful little message I’ve ever heard at a wedding. He talked about the importance of making Christ the cornerstone of their marriage. He even brought a brick (Nate always with the object lessons!) to serve as a reminder and asked them to paint today’s date on the brick while on their honeymoon. The ceremony was about 25 minutes, packed full of meaning, and fun! We then raced through pictures and headed to the reception for yummy stuffed pork chops and LOTS of cake!!! Around 8 p.m. things started to wind down and we said our goodbyes prepared for the LONG drive home. We left Nashville about 9 p.m. and determined to drive as far as we could. We made it halfway through Kentucky and stopped at a rest stop to sleep (if you can call it that) from 3:30-7:30 a.m.  Sunday – Driving, driving, and driving some more!! That pretty much sums up Sunday! Ked started to get sleepy again around 9:30 a.m. when we hit the Tennessee border. I had been dozing off and on so I took over the wheel. I burned through all of Tennessee and made it through Atlanta. We hit a patch of pretty hard rain in Tennessee, but thankfully it didn’t last for very long. Ked took over again and drove the rest of the way. We hit the Florida border at 5:30 p.m. and walked in our door at 9 p.m. While it was nice to get away and visit everyone, we were both ready to be at home and sleep in our own bed!! We unpacked the essentials and then took what I call the “Sigh Shower.” After traveling for so long and being away from home, it feels so good to wash away the travel dirt and get ready to sleep in your own bed. I can’t help but stand in the shower and sigh because it feels so good to be home! Needless to say, Sadie has been very needy ever since we walked in the door. Bobbie did a good job taking care of her, but you can tell she definitely missed our company. For awhile I wondered if she was going to let us sleep last night. She wandered around the house with her pathetic “Meooooowwww, Meoooowww” for awhile. Finally she jumped into bed between the 2 of us and purred away. She refuses to leave my side today. Wherever I am she has to be right next to me.  So that’s the rest of our trip in a nutshell! Today Ked headed off to some flash training for work. I’m finishing unpacking and doing laundry. Ked left the place absolutely spotless, which was sooo nice to come home too! All I have to do now is the laundry and put it away! What a great guy.  Well, I guess it’s back to the routine for a little while! Come visit soon!                "
"                 I have posted pictures of  urlLink Cession at the beach  last Sunday! I had tried to post them on Monday, but the in-laws' dial up connection is slower than slow! I feel like I've walked back into the dark ages!! Anyway, they are up now, so enjoy! You can also find them on the menu to the right under Living the PO!NT.   Yesterday was an awesome day! We spent the day in Lansing hanging out with the  urlLink GooseEgg  and his lady. We hadn't seen them and their kids in about two years, which is waaaaay too long! It's so great to have friends that you can just pick right up with no matter how long it's been. They are a treasure! And their 3 kids are so adorable! Five year old Dawson snuggled up next to me on the couch and looked up at me with big eyes and said, 'I missed you!' Awwww!! I couldn't believe he even remembered us since it had been over 2 years! What a sweetie and a super smart kid! I played several rounds of leap frog's find the state game, and was soundly whipped by a five year old! Those darn western states all look alike! GooseEgg's parents took the kiddies then the four of us headed out for a day on the town. GooseEgg and SupaK are old high school buddies, best man in each other's weddings, and college roommates freshman year. It gets kinda scary when they are together! We got several 'looks' from store clerks across the town! We had a great Mexican lunch, browsed a few stores at a nice new outdoor mall, practically polished off a dozen Krispy Kremes, took Ked to the famous Elderly's guitar store, and then headed to see the movie I, Robot. The movie was actually quite good! We all enjoyed it, and it had a great storyline. After all that we headed back to their place for the cheesiest pizza in the world!! As we took off for the night we all promised to not allow so much time in between visits. Hopefully they'll be able to come see us in Florida this winter!                     "
"                 Well the past couple days have been a whirlwind of fun! We made the 5 hour drive up to MI on Saturday with Uncle Dan. Ked was really really tired of driving!! We made it just in time for cake &amp; ice cream for Ked's birthday at Grandma's. It was a house full of aunts &amp; uncles &amp; cousins! The little cousins had several skits that they performed that were just hilarious. Crazy kids!!  &nbsp;  Then Sunday morning we got up pretty early and headed out to Grand&nbsp; Haven for the day. It was awesome to hang out at Watermark. The last time we were there was last fall during a preview service, so we hadn't ever been to an actual service. It was so awesome to see how God has blessed them all around. We were excited at the growth we saw. Nate and Cession had the service and it was awesome to relive Elk Lake as he and the students shared. Now that they've been home for awhile everything that happened and what they learned has started to sink in. What a cool group of students!!  &nbsp;  Sunday afternoon we hung out with Nate &amp; Jenn and Jenn's sister and brother-in-law. It was really cool to get to know her sister and brother-in-law. I couldn't believe how much she and Jenn were alike. It cracked me up. I think they could have been twins. We went out to lunch at Dee-Light and had some awesome nachos and a great meal. Afterward we walked down to the Mackinaw Kite Co and were playing with the toys. As we walked in Nate said this was a Ked kind of store. Little did he know just how much of a Ked store it was! Ked picked up some juggling clubs and a diablo and entertained a little bit. It was funny!  &nbsp;  Sunday evening we hung out with Cession and had a total blast. I had warned Ked that they were expecting some magic so he loaded his pockets with the standard 3 tricks (I think the only ones he knows anymore!) He got some pretty good reactions. Then we headed to the beach and the guys played football. The girls decided we were cold and hungry so we left to get food and head back to Nate &amp; Jenn's. My car decided they were hungry for pizza so we headed to the hut and ordered takeout. It was fun and the stuffed crust was yummy! Then after we had all re-gathered at the Smith's Ked gave his little message of encouragement to keep up the great work and learn to find and live their point. It was fun evening and we ended up leaving just a little after midnight.  &nbsp;  Today we slept in and we're just hanging out in Nashville. Dad's at camp this week but he came home this afternoon to hang out with Ked. I think they're over at the office strumming the guitars. Tomorrow it's off to Lansing for the day! It's a busy week!!                  "
"                  Ked is back!! Hooray!! My world is complete again. He and Uncle Dan arrived in Columbus about 9 p.m. last night after a long day of&nbsp; driving (they left at 4 a.m.!) It's so good to see him again!!     &nbsp;   Mom, Dad, and I spent the day in Lima visiting family yesterday. We had a great time hanging out at Grandma and Grandpa's. Shayna came over before she went to work and Jason came over after work and Ben and Beth were there too. We all had a nice Lee's Chicken lunch together!! I forget how funny Jason is! I can't wait until he and Shayna move to Florida in the next few years. After Shayna went to work, Ben, Beth, Jason and I played a round of pit and a round of Tri-Bond and Jason treated us to his usual quick wit and even made up a twangy song. What a goofball!! Aunt Jo came over after work; it was great to see her again as well! Then we had to take off pretty quickly because Ked and Dan were hitting the Ohio border. We zipped home and made it there just about a half hour before they did.     &nbsp;   And now today the big SupaK is 27!! We had a nice birthday brunch with his all time favorite - breakfast pizza!! We gave him a round of gifts, which included some nice toys for his camera. Then we discovered that Nikon did something goofy, and now he and Dan and Dad are out at the camera shop right now picking up another part so he can use his new filters on his telephoto lens. As soon as they get back I think we are headed up to MI for more birthday celebrations!   &nbsp;                  "
"                 I can't believe how quickly this week is flying by! I'm sad that the week with my parents is going so quickly, but I'm also happy, because Ked comes the day after tomorrow!! :)  Yesterday Mom and I spent the WHOLE day sewing my bridesmaid dress for Kurt & Michelle's wedding. I think it turned out pretty well. While Mom sewed, I read the directions, pinned, serged, and hand sewed. We had quite the little system going. It's always more fun to sew with a partner. This morning all we had to do was hem it and sew on the buttons and then give it a nice iron. I'm glad to have that out of the way!  I've been exhausted the past couple days. I don't know if it's because Mom is wearing me out or I'm still catching up from the lack of sleep at Elk Lake. I think I'll vote for the latter. Tonight we're going out birthday shopping for  urlLink someone's  birthday on Saturday!! He, he he!!  Well I suppose I should get back to work. I have a few more sewing projects to finish while I'm here and I only have tomorrow left since Friday we're going to Lima for the day!               "
"                 Today was fun hanging out with Mom, Jason, Shayna and Ben. We headed out late morning to Best Buy and then the big mall. I don't think I've spent that much time at a mall....ever! I'm not really a big mall person. I only bought 2 things - a shirt for Ked that hopefully will fit and a cool necklace that I found on clearance for $.97. If anyone is going to find the bargain it will be me! By the time we got home I was exhausted! I fell asleep in the car on the way home, then again before dinner, and then again in the recliner after dinner. So why am I still up??? It was fun and I tell you, my brother is hilarious!! He's full of quick and silly quips and he had us in stitches after dinner.  I chatted with the SupaK this evening. During those chats it almost seems as if we're not 1,200 miles apart. Although at times they remind us of that painful year we dated long distance... big phone bills and long goodbyes!! At least now we have free mobile to mobile minutes. Only 4 more days and we'll be together again!  I'll try to download the week at Elk Lake, but it seems to be the consensus among the Elk Lake bloggers that it just might be impossible to ever convey what took place up there. God was there and He moved. Otherwise the activities included seeing Saved! (which created very interesting discussion and a funny skit for skit night), a viewing of Spiderman 2 which totally rocks, dinner at Mongolian BBQ where we all ate too much and the waitstaff and grillers gave us lots of attention in many various forms! Campfires, smores, hobo pies, freshman guys taking 'baths' in the lake in the mornings (poor lake!), hemp necklaces, henna tattoos, Switchfoot in the mornings, and many experiences in the kitchen and over the charcoal grill (which I must say my gals did 10 times better grilling than the guys!). But the heart of the trip lay in the discussions in the living room and in cell groups, pouring over Ephesians, discussing community, surrounding each other, bearing each others burdens, breaking through barriers and bondages, and encouraging and praying for each other. When God shows up it's hard to explain in words what happens. We can describe activities but it is hard to explain the activity of the heart and soul. How do you explain developing a love for a group of ladies that can only come from God? How do you explain seeing their hearts open and how they grow? All I can say is that there is a group of students that are extremely special to me, and I am so excited to see where God takes them and how they follow His leading as they move through high school and into adulthood. They've been 'dared to move' and they are moving.               "
"                 Wow! What a fun day! I feel so much better after sleeping in today. My brother Jason and his girlfriend Shayna and my cousin Ben all come up today and are spending the night here at Mom & Dad's. What a crazy bunch (and that includes my parents!) We went out for a Mexican lunch and then Shayna insisted that we go to Maggie Moo's for ice cream. Who can resist that? Then Ben, Jason, Shayna and I decided to go see Spiderman 2 since Jason and Shayna hadn't seen it yet. I saw it last week up in Traverse with Cession but I was more than willing to see it again! What a great movie! Then we came home for Mom's famous Sunday night pizza and we watched Ice Age.  In the midst of all that today I still managed to get all my pictures from the last week and a half together and into a web photo album! Make sure you check out the pics from  urlLink Elk Lake  and  urlLink Shelley's wedding ! I also have links to them under 'Living the Point' on my menu to the right. I talked to Ked a couple times today (he helped me get online with my parents internet and get my pictures posted). He said I did a great job taking the pictures! That makes me feel good because he is the creative genius in our family, and I was using his camera and I don't know very much about it!!  Oh, in other big news tonight--- my younger brother Jason got engaged this morning!! He asked Shayna to marry him this morning at a park. They didn't tell us until tonight. I noticed her ring at lunch, and the thought crossed my mind that they might be engaged. But then since no one had said anything I didn't think much of it, especially since she works at a jewelry store. I thought it was just a nice ring she bought. So we are all excited for them!! Congratulations guys! We love you!  Well, it sounds like everyone is still going strong downstairs, but if I'm going to keep up with them and their planned shopping spree tomorrow, I should think about going to bed!!               "
"                 Well, I have rejoined the land of the blog!! I just spent a week up at Elk Lake with Cession and I had no internet or cell phone! I went through withdrawals the first few days, but then I managed ok! Wow. It has been such an incredible week full of so many emotions. I had such an awesome time with Cession that words can't even begin to describe. We saw God open hearts and break bondages, community developed and faith strengthened. There's a lot to process there and I'm not sure I'll ever fully comprehend it all! Then Friday morning I picked up a rental car and drove down to Detroit for Shelley's wedding. She was radiant and it was an absolutely beautiful day! It was my privilege to be a part of her and Joel's special day. Mom and Dad came up for the wedding and I rode with them back to Columbus. We got back a little after 11 and I just crashed. I told them that I probably wouldn't go to church with them (I didn't) because I desperately needed a full 8 hours of sleep or more since for the past week I had only got 5 or 6 hours a night, which for me is REALLY bad!! It felt sooooo good to sleep in this morning.  Well, Mom and Dad have a funky ergonomically correct keyboard and it's taking me a while to type!! Hopefully I can get my laptop hooked up to their internet. Boy do I miss our wireless network... If I get it hooked up I'll post a couple photo albums from the past week. So keep your eyes posted!  I've talked to Ked every day since I left. I think it's the only thing that's kept me sane. Thankfully the past week and a half has gone by quickly for both of us. Only 5 more days until he's here!! I can't wait!  I'm back!!               "
"                 Today was a fun and relaxing day. Mom, Karon, and I headed over to Hastings and had lunch at a great local Mexican restaurant before Karon had to go to work. The food was awesome and so much better than Taco Smell! After that Mom and I headed back home and did a little scrapbooking. I finished up a nice layout of some beach pictures from when Karon visited us in March. After that Mom and I headed over to Charlotte to check out a neat little scrapbooking store. They didn't have the flamingo diecut I was looking for, but they had several other things that I didn't realize I needed until I saw them! Then we headed to the dollar store and they actually had a little section of scrapbooking supplies and I picked up a couple packs of paper. From there we headed to Wal-Mart and then we realized we were hungry and it was supper time!! After supper, Mom and I watched a couple of the Season 1 episodes from Karon's new A-Team dvd set. What a great show and so over the top! Classic t.v. for sure!!  Now I am exhausted and am sure I will sleep quite well tonight!               "
"                 Well if you've paid any attention to the news today I'm sure you've heard about the two possible hurricanes that could hit Florida on Friday - Bonnie and Charley. The last time 2 hurricanes hit Florida within 12 hours of each other was something like 1906. We're not expecting too much to happen around here, although Ked said everyone at work is hoping to get the day off on Friday! It reminds me of those good 'ole northern snow days! We aren't on the Gulf here, but we could still get some heavy rain and wind. I'm thinking about getting some bottled water tomorrow just in case. I'm a little more concerned about my Grandma. Ked said I should call her tomorrow because reportedly Sarasota County could get hit pretty hard and even become the eye of the storm. We'll see if she wants to come stay here on Friday maybe.  Other than that the past few days have been pretty uneventful. I've been tired and rather unmotivated to get anything done around here. I've just managed to squeak out the bare minimum of my chores this week. I keep justifying it by telling myself I need the extra sleep because my body is working overtime!  Last night Ked and I had a business dinner in St Pete with a couple people. The one gentleman was the person who originally hired Ked at Cornerstone back in 2000. Rick is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet. You look into his eyes and you immediately know you can trust him. His faith radiates throughout his personality and you can't help but love him. He's what I call a '2 a.m.' person. I like to judge people based on the question, 'If we needed help would this be someone we could call at 2 a.m. and they would be there for us?' It's nice to have your life full of 2 a.m.-ers. You hope that you never need to actually call them at 2 a.m. but it is nice to have a roster of friends who have that kind of character. Anyway, it was great to catch up with him again, and he connected us with a business lady who has been running her own design firm for 24 years. As we talked with her, Ked and I saw what our future could possibly look like. She was sharp as a tack and a brilliant businesswoman. I told Ked later that I was quite proud of myself. Not once did I get lost in the technical talk and I held my own throughout the conversation. I've worked hard over the past 7 years to fully understand Ked's career and his skills. It took a couple years of shaking my head to get rid of that glazed eye look and asking lots of questions, but I'm quite capable now of carrying on a conversation with knowledgeable people about his line of work! Of course, it has helped that I've been involved in the same type of work, just on the project management side of the scheme and not the design side. Anyway, hopefully we will be able to assist them with some projects they may have coming down the pike. It was great to get out and she took us to a fantastic little bistro that had unbelievable food and prices. It was a wonderful evening.  Tomorrow should be a busy day. It will be the first full Thursday I've had since getting back from Michigan. Ladies Bible study is starting up again and we'll have Life Group as well. We'll be telling everyone about the baby, so that should be fun!!                "
"                  5/13/04   Two pink lines. It hardly seems real. When that second line appeared on the pregnancy test my jaw dropped open. Even though I had a hunch that I was pregnant, the confirmation was still a pleasant surprise. I must have looked at that pregnancy test about a hundred times. I told Ked the good news when I picked him up from work tonight. He had about the same reaction I did. In the back of our heads we KNEW, but still to know for SURE was amazing. We're embarking on a whole new experience!   5/16/04   Ked paid me a beautiful compliment today. We were sitting by the pool this afternoon and I was lamenting my fears about gaining weight during the pregnancy and not being able to drop it afterward or that I would gain too much weight, or that I was already starting to look fat. He looked at me and said, I think you're glowing. I responded 'Glowing??' He smiled and said with true love in his eyes, 'I think you are absolutely radiant and your skin is giving off this beautiful glow!' It made my heart melt!   5/19/04   I had another hormone attack this morning. Poor Ked. These raging hormones were my first signal that I was pregnant. We were stopping at the mall and I threw a fit because he was parking at the Sears entrance instead of a mall entrance. What the heck?? Even as I was ranting on and on I thought to myself, 'Why is this a big deal? These crazy hormones!' Ked just looked at me and said, 'This could be a long 9 months!!' I had to laugh and agree.   5/23/04   Ked did something funny today. He was walking behind me and grabbed my waist and started making little tickling motions with his fingers on my belly. He said in his cute little kid voice 'I'm tickling him!! He better get used to it!' It was really funny.   5/28/04   We had our first doctor's appointment today, and I must confess it was more than a little overwhelming. Ked got to observe me go through my whole hyperventilation doctor's office fears. I started taking deep breaths on the drive there and it continued through the waiting room. Waiting is always the worst. Once I get into the office and start talking with the nurses and doctors I am fine! I think it's just the anticipation that freaks me out, or something! We started out with a pregnancy test to confirm and then the nurse went through a stack of paperwork and handed us a sack full of magazines and samples. The nurse smiled and said, 'We'll give the bag to Dad to carry.' Ked said that was weird to hear her say 'Dad.' It all started to sink in during that hour visit. The Doctor was a hoot! He made everything seem really uncomplicated for which I was grateful. He was laughing and cracking jokes and was such a friendly, informative guy. We were both comfortable with him.  We went to the examination room and the Doctor did a sonogram. It was so amazing to see this little baby that is only 2.4 mm long. He pointed out the fluttering heart and it was so incredible. I really don't understand how people can say this is not a life. He measured the baby and set the due date back one week from what we thought originally making it January 23, 2005. That's just one day before my birthday! That will make the best birthday present ever.  With that we headed home and kept staring at the pictures. At times it still doesn't really seem real, I think mainly because I haven't been sick at all, for which I am grateful! Other than getting grumpy and emotional and needing to eat more often I really don't feel different.  On the drive home we started debating if we should tell anyone since we hadn't yet and who to tell and when to tell. We decided we'd go ahead and tell our parents and siblings and ask them to keep it to themselves for awhile. The doctor said at my next visit they will try to hear the heartbeat, but it might be too early. We' d like to tell everyone else while we're up north this summer.  When I called my Mom she was so excited. She's always in the baby mood and making baby things just because or for people she knows. She was all excited and exclaimed, 'Now I can start making baby things for real!! I need to get my knitting out!' It was hilarious.  Ked called and talked to his Mom and Karon; his Dad was out. They were both so excited as well. Later his Mom had his Dad call and Ked told him he was going to be a grandpa. Anyway, it feels strange knowing that people know now. We've kept it to ourselves for a few weeks. I know it's for real now especially since we saw the baby, but sometimes it still doesn't seem very real! I suppose it will eventually.  6/13/04  Tonight we were watching t.v. and a commercial for Wendy's came on, and suddenly I wanted a chocolate shake. I told Ked so and he said, 'I'm not going out for anything!' I haven't had any cravings really, although pizza and waffles always sound good, but so do fruits and vegetables. I sat there and all the sudden I said, 'Chocolate milk will do the trick!' I grinned at Ked with that 'will you go make me some?' smile. He just stared at me with the 'no, get it yourself' reply. Then I said outloud in a sweet little voice, 'Ked, the baby wants chocolate milk!!' With that he started laughing and as he headed to the kitchen said over his shoulder, 'That's a dirty trick!!' I thought to myself, 'A dirty little trick that I will have to remember!!'  6/22/04  There are so many unknowns with any pregnancy, but I imagine that the first pregnancy has the biggest unknowns since you've never been through it before and have absolutely no idea what to expect. What will the baby look like? What will his or her personality be like? What will labor be like? Will he or she be healthy? I imagine that all these questions and fears are normal. Today as I was thinking things over, God brought a passage from the Bible to mind. I've read it so many times before, but today it had all new meaning. I suppose that will happen a lot as we head into this new stage of our life. He pointed me to Psalm 139. We hear this verse proclaimed regularly as a case for pro-life issues, but today it was very personal.  1 O LORD , you have searched me and you know me. 2 You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. 3 You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. 4 Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD .  It hit me that God already knows all my thoughts and all my fears. Even before I cry out to Him and hand them over to Him, He knows what is burdening me. But the most powerful revelation that I will always remember came in verses 13-18.  13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. 14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. 15 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, 16 your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. 17 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! 18 Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you.  It hit me that God loves this child so much more than I ever can. He is creating him or her, and He thought of this little person long before Ked or I ever did. He knows what their life will be like, and he knows and loves them more than I can ever imagine. As I thought of the love that my Heavenly Father has for this child it quieted my heart and peace overwhelmed me. Suddenly my fears were vanquished and I knew I could trust God completely with the development and birth of this child. No matter what happens, God LOVES this little person more than I ever can, and I can fully trust Him. Then a second string of thoughts hit me and I realized that God has that same personal and passionate love for me. I've always known that God loves me, but suddenly in light of all this love I have for a little person I haven't even seen yet and realizing that God's love so incredibly surpasses my love, I was overwhelmed that this same love is directed towards me. Tears washed my face as I thanked God for giving me a small, small glimpse of what He thinks about me.  6/29/04 We went back for our second doctor's appointment this morning before I flew to Michigan. We didn't really know what to expect, so we were surprised when the Doctor said we were going to do a second sonogram. He said it was too early to try to hear the heartbeat. What we saw was absolutely amazing. In just over four weeks the baby had grew from just a flutter of a heartbeat to having a head, eyes, arms, and legs. We stared at the screen in awe and suddenly the baby rolled over!! The doctor looked at me and said, 'Now if you say you can feel that you're lying!' I don't feel anything yet, so it was so cool to see that now there's a tiny, tiny baby in there rolling around. Words just can't describe how in awe we were. We left the office a few minutes later just speechless. It was as if we didn't want to ruin the moment with our inadequate words.  7/26/04 We have returned from our visit up North, and although it was wonderful to see everyone, it was nice to get home again, especially for me since I had been gone almost four months. It was so exciting telling people that we were pregnant while we were up. We had quite a variety of reactions. When I saw a couple friends up north she looked at me and said, 'I knew it! I could tell from the moment I saw you!' The GooseEgg and his wife gave quite the emotional reaction. We were at their house and when Ked told them, the GooseEgg was standing in the kitchen wiping his eyes saying, 'I'm going to cry!!' It was so sweet. They have 3 precious little ones of their own, so they understand! We could have a very busy spring if everyone visits who said they will. We certainly hope that everyone does come! The more the merrier!!  7/31/04 Well I bought my first maternity clothes today. It was bit of a frustrating process. I'm at that awkward in-between stage where absolutely NOTHING fits! Most of my regular clothes, particularly all of my shorts, jeans, pants, and skirts no longer fit. Yet all the maternity stuff is to big! I did find a couple things on sale (plus we had no sales tax this weekend) that I think will work for a few months.  8/6/04 We went back for our third doctor's appointment today. It was a short visit and we heard the heartbeat. The doctor looked at us and said, 'It sounds like a girl to me!!' Our next visit is September 2nd, and if the baby is positioned right they should be able to tell us at that visit what gender it is! It was awesome to hear the heartbeat today, but we both agreed that we like the sonograms better because we actually get to see the baby! We have to wait a few more weeks for that though.                "
"                 When I was a little girl I used to dream about what it would have been like to grow up in the pioneer days. I read Little House on the Prairie and used to daydream about petticoats and wearing dresses all the time and riding horses on the farm. I was also an Anne of Green Gables fanatic and dreamt of meeting my Gilbert and dressing up in frilly dresses with puffy sleeves and going to fancy parties. There was something alluring about those eras. Something that seemed so much simpler.  Today while eating my lunch I turned on PBS and caught the ending of a program that profiled families who gave up the 21st century for five months to homestead in Montana. They left their large homes, fast paced life, and high profile jobs to live together in a small cabin that they built with their own hands. They raised their cows, pigs and chickens and grew their own wheat and corn. At first they all wanted to go home, but at the end of the five months they didn't want to leave. The show caught up with them two months after returning to their normal lives and every single one of them longed for the homestead. One family had moved into a giant new home that felt well...too big. The six of them missed being so close and hated that their new home was so big they didn't even know when someone else was there. The two 13 year old girls said that life in the 21st century was boring and they could only go to the mall so often. The young 10 year old boy commented on how much more he appreciated everything on the homestead. He said when he had fewer toys he valued them more and was so overjoyed when he got something new. Now he has so many things that they don't mean very much. One husband commented that he goes to work and his family doesn't have a clue what he does day in and day out. He missed the homestead days when they all worked together and had common goals. They all longed for the community they developed with their homestead neighbors. Out there you live life together because if you don't, you won't survive the winter.  As I watched them live on the homestead I was whisked back to those childhood daydreams of old. Life was tougher then, and the physical labor was harder, but there was something simpler, purer and uncomplicated about life. Your goals were survival, food, and shelter, and you couldn't accomplish that unless you worked together. How different that is from the two income, multi-directional lives we live. No wonder we have a hard time keeping families together. We don't even have true community or common goals within our own homes, let alone with our neighbors and church community. I think we could learn some things from life in 1883. I think we could unclutter our 21st century lives and learn to get by with less stuff. I think we could spend less time trying to accumulate stuff that doesn't mean anything and spend more time together and working toward common goals. I think we could spend more time doing life, truly doing life not just a barbecue on the weekend, with our neighbors.  It was ironic that I was telling Kedron about this thought over dinner and not long after we finished eating our power went off again, thanks to another storm. (I'm starting to feel like I'm back in West Michigan!) We had both just sat down at our computers to finish up some work when we lost power. It didn't bother us! We spent some time cuddling under the covers instead, looking through catalogs and talking about things to come. Ked commented, 'I'm glad the power went off.' And so was I! So I guess if you want a simpler life, turn off your power for a couple hours. Read a book, have a good discussion, play a game. Enjoy those that you live with.                "
"                 Well, I haven't posted in a few days! I think I've been discouraged by the lack of posting done by my blogging friends in the past month! I suppose Spilk &amp; Mitchell have an excuse. But you're back from the honeymoon!! Vacation's over! And well, King of the Road and the Mama had camp all last week, and well the Falcon's computer was in the shop...but all the rest of ya'll - no excuse!!  So Sunday was nice except SupaK had a headache all afternoon. After church we just hung out around here and then watched Return of the King that night, thanks to Jay-Bird who gave it to SupaK for his birthday. You don't know what you're missing, Jay-Bird! Oh, at church they told us that our praise band has been part of an American Idol type competition for Christian bands. Our band totally rocks, and they are one of 9 finalists going to Nashville in September. That is pretty cool!! I had a nice long chat with Karon when she called that night. Phonecalls like that make the distance seem not so bad.  Monday was cleaning day. I spent all day doing laundry and cleaning. SupaK kept the place spotless while I was gone, but somehow last weekend we managed to trash the whole place. I think Sadie helped too. After supper we went down to the gym. SupaK wimped out after only 10 minutes on the stairmaster. He's going to have to rebuild his stamina! Summer hours are over this week and he plans on running during his lunch breaks again starting next week.  Today was interesting. I got up and was doing some research online for a marketing project and the power went out. We've been getting a ton of rain the past week and have been under flood warnings the past couple days. A nice storm rolled through and knocked the power out around 11 a.m. Needless to say, that thwarted my plans of finishing my research and then doing some vacuuming. Funny how powerless we are without electricity!! Actually, it was kind of nice. There was really nothing for me to do except for read. What a bummer! I finished up a book I had started last weekend. Around 2 p.m. the power came back on and I had just enough time to vacuum, mop, shower, and get supper ready before SupaK came home.  Well, this rain needs to let up so I can go swimming again. These showers come through every day like clock work. Everytime I think about going for a swim I look outside and it's too late, the storm has hit. Ked and I were joking yesterday that we had better tans all winter long than we do this summer. Oh well, if I don't get out in June, July, and August because it's rainy and too hot, that's ok. I know that September through May will be perfect!                "

"              urlLink    The story of the blue typewriter...  When I tell my friends that I bought a typewriter, of course the first thing out of their mouths is, Why?  Why would I want a typewriter when I am surrounded by computers all day long.  To be honest, the reason for the typewriter purchase reflects just how big of a nerd I actually am.  Do you remeber years ago when you went to the library, and to check books out they had those cards in the back of the book?  Well, at a store in Highland, I found something called a 'Personal Library Kit' ( see http://www.thelibraryshop.org/librarykit.html ).  Included in this personal library kit are those cards and other things you need to make your own library.  Since I have already taken one Saturday and spent several hours creating a database (eg. catloging) my books, this kit looks pretty fun for me, as you might imagine.  Well, then I got to thinking.  How in the world would I put the title and author of the book on the card   without   a typewriter.  Hence, the purchase of a blue typewriter.  I found it on Ebay and got it for $5.  Well, the typwriter was $5 and shipping another $15.  I still think it was a good deal though.  Besides the nerdiness factor, I do find it quite satisfying to use a typewriter.  I make a ton of typo's, but heck, its all part of the mystique of it.         "
"             (Originally published on 5/19/2004)  Some of my kids have taken to callng me 'Miss Deb'. Its great fun...makes me feel like I am in the South or in Little House on the Praire.   Tonight I had to break up a pseudo fight. Two factions - a two fourth graders versus a 5th and two 7th graders. Doesn't seem like it is much of a contest, eh. I think the fourth graders wouldve given them a run for their money though. These little girls have got enough attitude to get them on Diva's Live.  The fight started with a look. One of the fourth graders said 'tell that girl to stop looking at me or she's gonna get her face beat in' I was like, hold up there sweetness. Aint nobody getting their face beat in at the library. In retaliation, the seventh grader goes to the fourth grader (with a sneer) 'What grade you in?'  Fighting words. I know.  In the end, I had the fourth graders promising a rumble and the 7th graders wanting to take it outside. Threats of banishment from the HC and a visit from security and the police dampered the fighting spirit a bit, till they took it outside and thought I would be none the wiser. I recruited the efforts of a librarian and together we stepped outside the library and broke up the 'rumble'. All in all, no punches thrown, just a lot of sneers and not so mean putdowns.  In the end, I got to be 'mean', which was actually kind of exciting. When one of the girls said, 'she started it', I used my moms phrase, 'I don't care who started it, I'm finishing it'.  Go Mistress Deb!          "

Check it out at www.colorquiz.com   Your Existing Situation Unwilling to extend herself or exert undue effort (with the possible exception of sexual activity). Feels that further progress requires more from her than she is willing or able to give. Would prefer reasonable comfort and security rather than the rewards of greater ambition.  Your Stress Sources Wants to overcome a feeling of emptiness and to bridge the gap which she feels separates herself from others. Anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to explore all its possibilities, and to live it to the fullest. She therefore resents any restriction or limitation being imposed on her and insists on being free and unhampered.  Your Restrained Characteristics Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood or adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement. Feels that she is receiving less than her share and that there is no one on whom she can rely for sympathy and understanding. Pent-up emotions and a certain egocentricity make her quick to take offense, but she realizes that she has to make the best of things as they are.  Your Desired Objective Needs a change in her circumstances or in her relationships which will permit relief from stress. Seeking a solution which will open up new and better possibilities and allow hopes to be fulfilled.  Your Actual Problem Feels restricted and prevented from progressing; seeking a solution which will remove these limitations.  Your Actual Problem .2 The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.

"             Last week was my first week as&nbsp;a Library Associate at the library.&nbsp; It was a kind of a&nbsp;learn off the seat of your pants week.&nbsp; I was just kind of thrown into it - mostly I worked circulation but I did handle the few reference questions that came by.&nbsp; My library is a small neighborhood branch that mostly serves kids, so there is generally not a lot of reference questions.   Top two reference questions last week:  A woman was renovating her house.&nbsp; She thought it might be a  urlLink bungalow  but she wasn't sure.&nbsp; She wanted the renovations and decorations to be accurate to the style, so we attempted to figure out the style of her house.&nbsp; We found some books at my library and ordered a whole bunch more.&nbsp; I also gave her the name of the architecture expert at the newspaper.&nbsp; Whenever I have been stumped with something - a good place for a special occasion dinner or wear to get a dress made - I email the appropriate person at the newspaper and they are really good about getting back to me.   A student was doing a report on his favorite book.&nbsp; He needed information about the illustrator.&nbsp; We looked in the books she illustrated, but to no luck.&nbsp; We looked at several different databases, still no luck.&nbsp; We googled her - no luck.&nbsp; We looked up the publisher and found out they were local.&nbsp; We called them, but they said that they do not provide information about the authors, other than what is provided in the jacket covers.&nbsp; Finally we looked up the illustrator, and it turns out she lives in Minneapolis.&nbsp; My supervisor actually called her, but I haven't heard if she called back.   Notable mention: Another customer called.&nbsp; She needed the customer service number of Stanley garage door openers.&nbsp; Let me tell you, there are a lot of businesses with the name Stanley.&nbsp; After several searches in the business database, I finally googled Stanley and garage door opener and hoped I found the right number for her.&nbsp; She never called back, so I assume it worked.   Odd Happening of the Week:  4 or 5 US Marshalls come walking in one day.&nbsp; They ask all of us working if we had seen a 6'3, 300 lb black man with corn rows.&nbsp; Apparently he was spotted on the main street a block away and took off running.&nbsp; I am guessing he was a 'pretty bad dude' with the presence of US Marshalls.&nbsp; I mean, it wasn't like they were just the regular police.   Tomorrow night my roommate and I are going to see  urlLink Lucinda Williams .&nbsp; This weekend my brother is getting married.&nbsp; The whole famdam will be in attendance.&nbsp; Very exciting stuff.

"             not just a  urlLink mausoleum  anymore.  On Wednesday night, I dragged a willing friend with me to a concert at the Minnesota Zoo Ampitheater.  On the bill -  urlLink Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band  with opening act  urlLink Jackie Greene .  To be quite honest, I really had no desire to see this Taj Mahal person - I had never heard of him before.  I had seen Jackie Greene last fall when he opened for Susan Tedeschi at the O'Shag at St. Kate's.  He made a believer out of me.  Who knew I would become an instant fan of a 23 year old blues/roots/country/rock playing soon to be superstar.  I bought both his CD's immedietly and made all my friends listen to them, making them believers too.  Wednesday night.  A perfect Minnesota summers day.  80 or so degrees...some humidity and more than a few mosquitos.  Lucky for us we were sitting next to a smart person with some spray and she let us use some.  Only came out of there with a half dozen or so bites.  Jackie got on stage around 7:30, while there was still another hour and a half of good sunlight.  He blew everyone there away.  I'm not lying.  I think there might have been a handful of us who had ever heard of them before, but this crowd ate him up.  He doesn't banter so well with the crowd, but they were all just astonished that a 23 year old could write and sing this kind of music.  Serious. Check him out.  After his set, my friend and I stretched our legs and scoped the merchandise.  We ended up being two concert weenies and buying the commemorative tour t-shirt.  But hey..its a pretty cool t-shirt.  We even got them signed by the man himself.  When I told him that I saw him in the fall and owned his cd's and told him I came to the concert to see him open, he said 'That's awesome'.  Now, don't get the wrong idea.  I am definently not a groupie - there were some girls there who would take those honors that night, but I just wanted to let him know that I appreciated his craft.  The roar of the crowd and the wail of a guitar told us the starring act had taken the stage.  We made our way down to our seats again, not prepared experience the...well, the experience that   is   Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band.  On stage you have Taj Mahal on an electric guitar, a bass, a slide guitar, a man who played the sax, flute, and a few other weird looking instruments, and, get this, three ukeleles.  They wailed though.  It was unbelievable.  The best concert of my life.  You should have seen it...all these white middle-aged Minnesotan's getting up and dancing - in daylight - like no one was watching.  Wonders never cease...         "
"             Oh, a nickel for every time I heard that at 7 am.  Well, I guess I would have a nickel, but the moral of the story is, if on the first day you have your new phone and the number used to belong to a sanitation removal company, change it.  Don't think it will eventually go away.  Just change it.  June 1st my roommate and I had a new phone number/new apartment.  June 1st we started getting about 30 calls a day about picking up peoples trash.  The calls would start around 6:30 in the morning and last until at least 7 at night.  What I liked the best was when a woman called and asked for my father.  I said, uh, no, he wasn't there.  She laughs and said, Are you sure [little girl].  I told her that I was pretty sure he wasn't there, since he didn't live with me.  She only called back about five times to make sure.  Now, most of these calls it was fairly obvious they had the wrong number.   First scenario.   Me: Hello?   Them: Yeah, hi, you didn't come get my trash today.   Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number.   Them: What? Isn't this ....  Me: Yeah, but they don't have this number anymore.   Them: Do you know what their new number is?   Me: No.  Bye.  Second scenario. Me: Hello? Them: [something in a language I don't speak] Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number. Them: [more of the language I don't speak or understand] Me: YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER.  THEY DON'T HAVE THIS NUMBER ANYMORE. Them: Hang up and call again. Four or five times.  The final straw for us came with the couch question.  A young woman was very distraught that we didn't come pick up her couches.  I gently explained to her [at 7am] that we could not remove her couches and that I did not know who she could get to remove them.  She was upset because her landlord was upset, she explains.  After a lengthy conversation, her trying to convince me to do something, me trying to convince her that I couldn't, she dropped the bomb.  My phone number was on the side of trash cans everywhere around the city.  YIKES!  That afternoon I convinced the phone company that I desperatly needed a new number, I googled it, and it appeared to be a safe choice.    Moral of the story: Never talk to strangers about trash removal.         "
"             These last couple weeks I have had the worst run of bad luck.  First, my car stereo is stolen last week.  Just the face and a connector piece.  Enough that my stereo did me no good and the stolen pieces did the thief no good.  There's a $100 down the tubes.  Two nights ago when I was at work, a rotten child (I'm assuming) came into the staff room - while I was in the adjoining office with the door open - and stole my cell phone.  Argh!  Thankfully I had my old cell phone and even had a sim card all ready to go.  Except now I think my battery might be old because I charged it yesterday and it was already dead today and I didn't really talk on it at all.  The kids at the library have been out of control this week.  I think they are mostly bored with the summer, because they do nothing but cause trouble.  I think today might be the first day that I didn't yell at any kids.  All week long, it has been a constant battle with them.              "
"             Last night I attended my 5 year high school reunion.  It was a tolerably pleasant evening.  I didn't really have any burning desire to see the people that I remembered from high school - for the most part I have kept in touch with the people I considered good friends.  I did have one pleasant surprise of a friend there.  I hadn't spoken with her since graduation.  I think we may have emailed for a bit a year or so after graduation, but we lost touch.  It was great catching up with her.  After a few hours though, I had about as much as I could take and took off.  5 years really didn't change anyone that much - old attitudes die hard.  This last week the esteemed mayor of Saint Paul, Mr. Randy Kelly, endorsed George W. Bush for re-election.  Now, this news wouldn't be so shocking, except that Kelly is a long-time DFL (Democrat to those non Minnesotans) party member.  He is from the East Side of Saint Paul, where a Republican hasn't been elected from that district in god knows how many years.  This endorsement comes as a bit of a shock.  Maybe its something in the water, as our last mayor also switched from DFL to Republican.  Although Kelly has stated that he has no intentions of switching parties, there are rumors that the governor may give him an appointment to a state post, or that he might run for US Senate.  The reason that Kelly gave behind his decision to back Bush is that he saw a bumper sticker that said 'I Hate Bush'.  He decided the liberals were pushing the politics of hate and his mind was made up from there.  I am thinking that if the mayor of Saint Paul bases his decisions upon bumper sticker politics, the DFL party might be better off without him.  Also in the political arena, this new terror threat bothers me.  Not that I am afraid of a terror threat, but that it seems to be politically motivated.  Normally candidates can expect a boost in the polls following their nominating conventions, but with the announcement of a new 'terror' threat, the Dept. of Homeland Security all but nullified the effects of the convention.  The Kerry camp has denied that it thinks the announcement was politically motivated, but honestly, can we really trust what we are being told?   From the 8/8/04 edition of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press 'Now, on the subject of the convention, most observers agreed last week brought a newly energized Democratic party, one focused on a common goal. With the party now in the spotlight, many people are wondering... ' (Stewart is handed a piece of paper) 'Oh. Terror warning. Guess I'll have to stop talking about the Democrats.' — Jon Stewart  On a lighter note, a  urlLink recent news item  states that the Dutch are now working to ban toe-licking.  Obviously seeking to protect the Danes pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, a simple solution is to ban toe-licking.  As I know you can all agree with me, when my toes get licked, I really do have a hard time feeling safe.  While the article states that the 'would be Casanova' could not be charged with any crime for licking unsuspecting ladies toes, I have to wonder, just how many different body parts can a stranger lick before commiting a crime.

"       There is only one TV in my apartment that has cable and last night it was tuned to the Democratic National Convention. That's right the DNC. I'm pretty sure I have never watched a National Convention before and last night it became clear as to why that was the case. First, I should remind everyone how much distaste I have for politics. I have often said that I hate politics, but this is a stretch of the truth and only an easy way to say what I really mean. I don't like political nonsense! This comes mostly in the form of political propaganda, which is what the Repulican/Democratic National Convention is all about.    On a lighter note I do have a couple of good things to say about the DNC. One good thing about democratic ticket is John Edwards. This guy seems to be a very genuine guy. When he talks it at least sounds like he believes all the propaganda BS coming out of his mouth and I can respect that. Choosing him as VP is probably John Kerry's brightest move in the campaign yet. Now we turn the tables and look at Kerry. I don't really see anything genuine coming out of this character. The question that I most recently posed was...'Is Kerry THE RIGHT candidate or is he just NOT THE WRONG candidate?' Feel free to look at this however you choose because that is what it is all about...choice. But it seems to me that everyone I talk to about politics isn't arguing for Kerry so much as they are arguing against Bush.           "

However, let's not forget that Atlanta and Philadelphia are no slouches in the East. Whether they make the cut or not, one thing is sure for the Cubs in the second half of the season; now that the Cubs DL is almost empty they still have an enormous uphill battle for second place and a Mt. Everest climb for a sure shot at a playoff birth. Which brings me to my true point...Kenny's $20 bet is as good as toast.    "
"       In society today we are judged by things like the way we dress and the music that we listen to. Pop culture determines whether we are part of the in crowd. I think it is dumb and stupid, but I'm am just as much at fault as anyone else. Of course the only thing worse than Pop Culture is Counter Culture.            "
"       This post is less fun and more soap box, but it's my blog so back off. I was having a conversation the other day about the vegetarian diet. If this is how you have chosen to 'take care of yourself' I'm fine with that. However, I do believe that we have canine teeth (incisors) for a reason and&nbsp;I don' t think it is to bite through fruits and vegetables. Nonetheless, there are really only certain types of vegetarians with which I have a problem and they will be referred to as the 'militant vegetarians.' I think anyone who isn't a vegetarian will understand what I mean by this. Basically, a 'militant vegetarian' is one who causes problems when it comes time to chose a restaurant. The normal people in the group are forced to eat at some 'vege-friendly' place to accomadate the minority. It's not even close to the same, but it feels like affirmative action. You may notice that I described the non-vegetarians the normal people. If you think this is some sort of discrimination then I believe you need not look any further than a general census percentage to see that people who eat meat are, in fact, in the norm. I'm not going to say who is and who isn't a militant vegetarian, but if you read this and didn't think you fit the category you are probably safe. If you felt like I was talking directly to you then you have just indicted yourself. If you have any comments on the subject...I would love to hear them.          "
"       So just for fun comment on these questions if you are feeling saucy.  1) Would you rather live in N.Y. or L.A. and why? 2) How many years will you wait to have children after marriage? 3) What is the air-speed velocity of a laden swallow?         "
"       Every once in a while we find ourselves roaming the internet looking for something new. Trying to find something that will entertain us for a couple of hours while we avoid whatever it is that we were supposed to be doing instead. The answer for today is blogs. And if all goes well I may have to try it again tommorow.         "
"       Whatever happened to those days when a major championship in golf meant at least 2:1 odds on Tiger Woods to win. You could ask anybody in a straight up bet, 'Do you want to take Tiger or the field?' More than half of the time people would have taken Tiger. That trend has disappeared in the last couple of years. People say Tiger's game is off due to his 'coaching' change. Tiger swears that isn't the problem and says he is just ironing out a few rough spots in his new swing. New swing? What the hell was wrong with the old swing? It seemed to be working just fine.  Maybe he has a flare for the dramatic and just wants to make a great comeback. Who knows? All I can say is that I miss watching the last day of the majors and seeing Tiger chase the trophy (or jacket, cup, plate, etc.) The funny part about it is that most of the time I was routing for the other guys on the last day. As long as it wasn't Vijay I usually wanted somebody else to have success. However, at the end of the day, if Tiger won the tournament I was just fine with that too. So let's just say that come tommorow I hope that Tiger can get off to a good start and not be playing from behind like he has in all the majors so far this year. Agree or agree to disagree?          "
"       So now that I have finished watching the documentary 'Bowling for Columbine' by Michael Moore it is time to give my personal opinion. Why? Because I am entitled. First, I'd like to say that overall I like the movie and I think Moore had some very good points and showed many interesting things that I had never contemplated. Second, I would like to point out that I don't really agree with many of his methods for getting people to say what he wants them to say. If you don't believe that you can force the public to say what you what then I have plenty of arguments of opposition. Nonetheless, one thing that upset me was the end when he was borderline badgering Charleton Heston after he was nice enough to give him time for an interview. Getting back to the point of the movie brings me to my final opinion. In the movie Moore is searching for a reason why the US has so many gun related murders between its citizens (yes this is one of the things he was bugging Heston about.) I have an answer to this question and while it may not be the sole reason, I think it certainly has an affect. What is the answer...The American Ego. I think we live in a country that is very built up in its own pride. We believe that our country is far superior to other counties, our states are superior to other states, etc. The American ego can easily be seen in the 'good ole boy' who believes strongly in spreading the democracy of America. The best example I can give of this is our good friend Greg (no offense buddy, you know I love ya man.) Greg loves our military and knows that we are superior to other countries. This is one place the egocomes into effect and it consumes us all. Yes, I said all and that includes me. I am no different from Greg in this way, but I just don't voice it as boisterously. I think that people are so caught up in their own pride that we don't stop to think about the consequences of the things that we are doing. We forget to think about others and who might get hurt. I'm cutting myself off now but feel free to comment. Right, wrong, or indifferent?          "
"       Roger Clemens has been labeled as a head hunter on more than one occasion and some would say he has made a career out of it. He is more than willing to throw high and tight to the best in the league to get the psychological edge. I understand that this is part of the game for some pitchers so I let this slide. After all he is a great pitcher. Then comes the Mike Piazza fiasco. Piazza breaks his bat on an inside pitch and Clemens chooses to pick the bat up and throw it at him. I thought this was in poor taste, but most of the media stands up for him and tells us that he is a 'fiery pitcher who was caught up in the heat of the game.' Somewhat disappointed I accept this excuse and move on. But it doesn't seem to stop there with more bean balls to the helmet. Now he has officially made it to my ugly celebrity list. On July 31st, while watching his son play in a little league tournament in Colorado, Roger Clemens was ejected to the parking lot by an umpire. Wait it gets worse. On July 31st, the Astros were in Cinncinati playing the Reds and needless to say Roger wasn't there. Now I'm not very impressed with that part of it because he's not doing a very good job of displaying team unity, but at least he was cutting class to go be with his family. Now on the subject of the ejection. WHAT THE F$#@? Not only is this a 10-year old little league game, but he has no business arguing with the umpires. You can be sure that every kid on that team looks up to him and I don't think arguing about calls makes a very good impression kids of any age. Apparently he wasn't thrown out for arguing, but instead for spitting a sunflower seed on the umpires pants. While this alone is no reason to be tossed, it certainly is not behavior becoming of a professional baseball player. You can make comments to defend him if you want, but I don't think it is going to change my mind.          "
"       Things are starting to look bleak for John Kerry in the presidential race. According to polls taken by the USA Today (which I assume are pretty reliable) Kerry lost 1% and Bush gained 2% following the Democratic National Convention. This hasn't happened since the 70's and you can bet that Bush isn't going to make the same mistake at the Republican Convention and it seems to me that his lead will only grow. I think there are plenty of supporters that still haven't come out of the wood works. As usual comments are welcome.          "

"           A lot of people believe that an employer’s decision on  hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience.  Well they couldn’t be farther from the truth because that is  false.    Here is the truth…      Skills and experience within your profession aren’t what  gets candidates the job. The truth is that there are too  many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get  the job, and ONLY one usually gets the job.       Companies are looking for more than skills and  experience these days. So it’s extremely important that you  all your individual characteristics mirror your passion.    So what are the other factors that are usually invisible to  candidates?   **Self-Awareness** – who are you and where are you going?  What are your plans for the present and the future? How do  you know what you want? How do you know that you’re right  for this job? Employers want to make sure that you’re not  lost.   **Learning Skills** – Are you willing to learn? Are you  current on trends and technology? Are you a person who loves  to “grow” within their profession? You want to show an  employer that you’re a candidate that learns in order to  progress your career.    **Adaptability** - With everything changing so rapidly  today, it’s possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer  be relevant. Are you a person who adapts well to change?   **Character** - Do you show passion in your industry,  because when you do, it projects through your résumé, cover  letter, and especially during the interview. An employer  wants a dependable trustworthy employee. The more you  project your positive character, the better!        You can have a huge advantage over your competition by  going one step. Create a career portfolio and within it make  sure that you showcase all the categories above in the  proper manner. I guarantee that this will give you a major  edge over your competition.        So you see that it’s not all about skills and  experience. It’s really important that you consider the  factors above, because them alone can get you the job.     =========================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

"       Emailing may seem simple, but there are some complications that you need to be aware of, otherwise, your email may never be read by an employer.   1.) Your subject line is crucial…   How would you like the employer to be drooling to read your résumé? Of course you would, right? Because that will increase the likelihood that the employer will read you whole cover letter and résumé.   Note: An employer usually takes 10 – 15 seconds to overview a cover letter and read it.   It is to your advantage that they completely absorb your cover letter and résumé. The subject line of to your email can create this urgency, this excitement, and this greed within the emotions of an employer.   To give you proof of what I just said, what motivates you to read most of the articles that you like to read? I bet it’s the headline. Nine times out of ten, if the headline doesn’t interest you, then you won’t read it.   It’s no different with an employer…they are human just like you. We read what we want to read and what we read usually strikes our interest.   Tips on writing a magnetic headline:   ** Write a subject line addressing the company needs, NOT yours.  Ex. I have ___accomplishments to provide value toward ____ position   ** Put the employer’s name in the subject line (notice the cliff hanger as well…)  Ex. Hi Dave, I love your product and I would like to work for…   ** Stir the employer’s emotions by teasing them with value.  Ex. Here is how can increase your sales by 8%  Ex. How would you like a lawyer who has won 98% of the time!  Ex. I am used to communicating with dozens of people who recommend me to other friends.   3.) Houston we have a problem with spam filters   According to Time Magazine, between 40-70% of all email is getting killed (Spam Filtered) BEFORE anyone has a chance to read it? It’s true!   You may think an employer is getting an email but nope it never reaches the email inbox because the spam filters stole it like a thief in the night.   What can you do to make sure your email arrives to an employer?   You have a choice. You can ask if the company uses a spam filter or you can assume that they do. I don’t know the exact statistic for the exact number of companies that use spam filters, but I would make an educated guess that it’s 50% at least.   I would say that your best bet would be to prepare for the spam filter. The spam filters have a point system. Now usually when a email has more than 5 points then your email will ether not make it to the inbox or it will be place in the spam filter folder.   To give you an example on how the point system words: If you have “Free” anywhere in your message and especially in the subject line, you will receive 2 points automatically. There are many words that trigger points, and its way too long and boring to go through all of them. So here is…   A free resource which detects your point system of an email:   lyris.com/contentchecker   3.) How should I send my résumé?   Before I begin writing about how to send your résumé it is critical that you ALWAYS include a cover letter with your résumé. That’s right, even when you send it through email.   You actually have a choice. You can send your résumé and cover letter in the body of the email, or as an attachment.   Beware! Sending your résumé as an attachment could cause it to be scrambled or lose it format structure during its journey. This means that an employer wouldn’t be able to read or have trouble reading your résumé. So how can prevent this from happening?   Send an email to yourself. Go to msn.com and yahoo.com to get a free email account from each. Then send your résumé and cover letter from one to another and see whether your résumé and cover letter are formatted correctly.   Should I send my résumé and cover letter in the body of the email or as an attachment? I recommend that you do both. That way you know the employer will be able to read it, no matter what.   Check with the email content checker above and see whether your email with the attachment has under 5 points. If not, then I recommend that you send two emails to the employer’s inbox. The first has the attachment and cover letter and resume in the body of the email as well. Then send another email with just the cover letter and resume in the body of the email.   ========================================================  David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

"            There are over 6 Billion people on earth, and to no surprise there aren’t 6 billion jobs to equal the score. As a matter of fact, there aren’t even 1 billion jobs in the world today.   What does this mean for you?       You have plenty of competition in your industry and the numbers aren’t getting any smaller. There is a new person born in your industry every minute. So for you to stay in the elite crowd or join the elite crowd in your industry you have to create what I call a “Distinguished Identity.”   What makes you special in your industry?  What have you done that very few have done in your industry?  What can and what will you provide on a guaranteed basics?        These are all questions that employers want to see within you. The job of the employer is often tough because they have to search to find out what’s within an individual. The employer or recruiter has to search if nothing stands out to be beneficial to the job. Most employers are to mature to go hide and go seek, so don’t hide behind the tree.          The key is to make yourself into a shining bright light like the sun if you will. Make it easy for employers to see your benefits, and they will find it much easier to hire you. What is one way you can separate yourself from the crowd and become the first star to shine bright at night?  Let me tell you a secret…       Did you know that fewer than 15% of people who have a career DON”T have a career portfolio. I willing to bet that in your industry it’s way smaller than 10%. What is a career portfolio?       A well-prepared portfolio that provides 'evidence' to an employer of your accomplishments, skills, abilities--it documents the scope and quality of your experience and training in the proper manner.       A career portfolio reveals everything an employer wants to know about you. Remember an employer usually doesn’t hire an individual if there are unanswered questions. So you want to make sure tat every question is answered promptly, vividly and clearly.  ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

"       1.) “Proof” shall set you free!      Put yourself in the shoes of an employer or recruiter for a minute. Looking over hundreds of applicants, they always have a problem. Which is a major problem…they have no idea which individual has the best package to deliver.        That’s why there is an interview to choose that one person. Who is the person that gets the job? The individual who show the most “Proof” that they can get the job done.  What shows “Proof” to the highest degree during a job search? Without hesitation it’s a well organized career portfolio.        Employer Moto: You can have the skill and have plenty of experience, but you still have to prove that you’re worthy of the job.    2.) Are you waiting for a Promotion?       A popular question in the job industry is how can I get a promotion or how can I get promoted faster? Here is the simple reply to that question…      Create a Career Portfolio that exemplifies your skills, experience, and most important accomplishments. Let me ask you a question: Why should you get promoted if you can’t at least “show” what you have accomplished?      Your reply to this question may be “they should already know since I’ve been working there for so long.” This is not the case. The bottom line is this… companies don’t record what you have accomplished. They just evaluate whether you’re doing the job or not.       Your accomplishments probably go way beyond what you have done for the company. And guess what…your company or association definitely doesn’t know about that. So always keep a record of everything that can be tied to your profession.   3.) Are you in need of a raise in salary?      Who wouldn’t love to receive a raise? The real question that you need to answer is “Why should you receive a raise in salary? One of the hardest aspects of a career is getting that raise.       The more value you bring to a company or association, the more you get paid. You can have the skills and experience, but that still doesn’t answer the question: Why should I give you a raise?      Here is the solution to getting a raise. You have to prove to the company that you can provide more revenue or value then a normal individual. Just to give you one quick tip on how to distinguish your value from others… create a career portfolio and within that portfolio compare your skills to other people who work in your industry.       That way you eliminate the work for the employer. Now they don’t have to figure out whether you’re worth a raise because you have already showed them proof of why you’re worth more than the average person. Remember, it all starts with providing the company with more revenue or value…that is the key.   ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

"            The person who always gets a good job is relentless and persistent in getting the job. The person who goes an extra mile by doing the unnecessary. It’s the person who goes above and beyond by doing something different or unique.        We have been playing by the same job search methods for years. But I found out a startling pattern with the people who bend these traditional methods.       The traditional methods are creating a resume, cover letter, or filling out a job application. Is there a law that states that you must not go beyond these methods? Of course not, I recommend that you do more by striving for what you want.

Let me give you a few examples that are rarely used:   ** Spice up your resume or cover letter by including a testimonial.        Have a current or past employer give you a testimonial based on your skills and accomplishments. I’m telling you that this will strike the interest of any one who reads your resume or cover letter.  ** Come in with a plan.       Nothing rocks a company’s or employer’s boat like a person who comes in with a plan that will increase the company or association’s revenue or productivity.        Take a moment and brainstorm some ideas that could improve the value of the company you are applying for. It will be well worth your time and effort.      ** Be included within the top 5% by the follow-up.        Yes, about 95% of job seekers usually don’t follow up. Remember that companies hardly ever hire a person in just a few days. It takes weeks to fill a position.        So guess who the employer will remember the most when the time comes to hire that one individual. It’s that person who has multiple exposures. Always remember that our human mind stores much easier from repetition…so don’t be afraid to follow up.  ** You can really crush the competition with a career portfolio.        Yes, it doesn’t matter what industry you’re part of, you can create a career portfolio even if you haven’t been working for long.        Your portfolio doesn’t have to be about how you perceive yourself.

"           Last weekend was a memorable one for me!  I have been to the street at George V near Arc De Triomphe to buy a camera looking for a SONY showroom. It’s verisimilar to the Brigade Road in Bangalore but its very long and very wide with wide platforms.  When I reached here I was thinking that people here are too cold like the weather here. But the walk down that street made me re-think! People are screaming! But maybe that’s not real happiness, but at least you get a feel of how it would look like!  On both the sides of the street there are big automobile showrooms of every international carmakers!  Wherever you go you see the orderliness of the buildings and the meticulous plan of the city that makes transport so easy and trouble-free unlike our Indian roadways and railways which are quite confusing! You just have a map of Paris with the routes of RERs, Metros and SNCFs (various types of trains) and voila! you can go anywhere without troubling anybody. Cool!  Then at last in a showroom in La Defense I saw a camera that was good and I bought it.  The next day I’ve been to 'Musee de Louvre' and 'Tour Eiffel'.  Just to behold the building of the museum, which they say was used by Napoleon Bonaparte, is wonderful. It’s too huge.  The museum is divided into 4 main buildings with 2 stages. After spending some 6 hours inside, I could cover only half of it!  The sculptures and the paintings have a lasting influence, which makes them eternal. The Greek and Italian sculptures of the well-built kings and soldiers made me feel very puny! There is one feeling that runs and that connects all these pieces in the museum together. BEAUTY. Exquisite, exemplary beauty in all its splendours. No inhibitions whatsoever. The artists just seem to express themselves.  The sculptures and paintings make you think that artists love nudity for its revealing beauty of the human body. Felt proud of having one of those myself! Common people seem to abuse this!  When I saw those paintings, I really wondered how the society would have tortured those artists, those amazing gods of eternality, for they might not have been 'productive' by its standards! Surely many of them would have died of starvation for the world accepts a genius only after it slays him! Felt really strange! Every one of those paintings and sculptures tell you a story , even though the explanation given by the placards placed in front of them speaks French! I understand and cry as a salute to those gods!  There was a rush to see the Monalisa painting .For once, you feel that all ways in the museum lead to that painting! But when I saw that, I couldn’t quite understand what’s so great about it, thanks to my appalling ignorance of art! That too the lady looks as if she has not slept properly posing for the picture! In spite of my ignorance, I saw many other paintings that captured my attention and ate my memory card of the camera!  Next I've been to the Eiffel tower, just to have a look at it. Thought that it would not be so interesting and would be dull to behold. But as usual I was proved grossly wrong! What a massive structure and what imagination! Indeed people who love beauty seem not to think of logic, reasoning and purpose. But I think that even though it looks like that prima facie, its not so. Beauty is in itself a purpose! Create things which are beautiful and you have given them a meaning for them to exist!  When I get closer and closer to the tower, I slowly realized the size. I felt really fearful when I was at its foot. Beauty and mass mixes up to produce fear?! Quite strange! For every 10 minutes of an hour they switch on the lights, which randomly sparkle all over the tower and which simply cannot be captured by a still camera! Nor do I think that any kind of recording can capture the feeling. I stopped clicking and just stood at the foot and looked up and it’s a dream! Forget everything and look at it! You feel at once lost and above anything else!  People here seem to pay a lot of attention to beauty, love and experience.   THEY LIVE!  Merci.          "
"           As if I command the sunrise and sunset, I planned to visit all over the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements of the city of paris! So I took the map which I had bought earlier and noted down the important landmarks in those areas.It read like this: 1.Notre Dame Church, 2.Beauborg district (a book said that it’s the most picturesque place in Paris), 3.Ile de la Cite, 4.Quartier Latin, 5.Top of the Eiffel Tower, 6.Ile Saint-Louis. This seems to be a short list!  When I reached Notre Dame Church it was already 1pm, since I woke up very late!  Notre Dame church is an architectural feat! And it has been carved in the early 14th century. When I was in there , I could not realize the historic importance of that building. If you do not know a bit of history of Paris and its monuments, its of almost no use visiting them except for their picturesque beauty! It has witnessed great historic moments like the crowning of King Napolean to the most recent one like the visit of King Narayan I !  I have always wondered why does a human being require an institution like religion and more strangely an institution like marriage! Its quite perplexing if I go looking for an answer! It seems to me a pre-historic question which should not be pondered upon in the post-modern 21st century where its taken for granted by majority that these institutions are indispensable part of a human life! Quite strange! But in spite of having not an answer for this question , I realize Notre Dame church epitomizes the importance given to a religion by the kings and the commons, verisimilar to the attention that the temples in south India had received.  Before getting into the church I circumambulated around the building to record its beauty. It has intricate carvings with a lot of detail. Outside the church there's a wonderful garden. Before again reaching the entrance to get into the church, I went into a small gift shop and bought some souvenirs which were quite cheap by money but pretty rich with meaning. I don’t buy things like this very often. I consider them junk .But this time they had some meaning to be transferred!  Then I went into the church. There was some prayer going on. The hall looked gloomy and tall with lot of arches on the roof. Nothing much to see inside. The carvings, a placard said were done in mid-14th century! It had those colourful stained-glass paintings. I got bored inside. Things like these look pretty outside, but internally they stink with rotten meaninglessness!  When I came out of the church it was 4pm and I had to buy vegetables and other cookeries at Gare Du Nord and had to visit the top of the eiffel tower. I had to ditch the idea of visiting all other places since that shopping will take a couple of hours and I should be there at the top before sunset to capture the view both at daylight and artificial lights. I went to the Eiffel tower. There was a huge rush and I thought it would take a couple of hours to even get the ticket and then ditched that idea too and went to Gare du Nord, bought some vegetables and returned to the room.  But amidst these I roamed around the Beauborg district , before going to Eiffel tower. As far as I have seen Paris and that place, its certainly not the most picturesque one! Bastille seems to be a very good place, with peaceful gardens, to live at.  When I was walking along these streets I saw an old woman who looked like some 40 years old. She was almost half-naked and with a lot of facial make-up. At the first sight I thought she was waiting for somebody, just like anybody else and my pace of walk was quite normal. Then within another furlong, I saw another woman in the same state. Another one...another one...Now I realised who they were!! Some were young too! I had a lot of money in my pocket. There's nobody in that part of the world who would recognize my identity. All alone in that atmosphere! I could do it if I want! Then a strange fear crept inside my mind. I cannot explain to myself why I felt like that. Freedom and fear, I thought are quite opposite. But here I experienced both these seemingly mutually exclusive emotions at once. That increased my pace of walk. I got out of that place as soon as I can! Even now I feel that pace!  There was another incident which affected me this day. When I was metro-ing towards Eiffel Tower I guess, there came a violinist-beggar inside the cabin where I was sitting. By now, I am used to these metro-beggars who play some music and ask for money and the kind of body-build and the faces and eyes they possess. Opposite to me there sat a man whose eyes cannot concentrate on a place for long. His hair was disheveled and his eyes rotund. He was holding a new tome in his hand. I could read from his face that he doesn’t have what it takes to read a book! He opened the book and started reading. Within a second he flipped through the pages and looked at me who was staring at him! He kept on flipping the book like that as if he lost his golden ring somewhere in between the pages! My guess was right! He cannot read a book.  In the meanwhile the violinist had been playing his tune. His eyes looked quite strange. There was no sign of begging. He was adroit with that instrument. But this is not unusual since he might have played the same piece of music a thousand times before. His face impressed me. He looked like a normal guy who might as well be working as a software engineer! I felt from his eyes that he could take up my job and he would do better than myself and definitely I cannot play that violin like that! He ended his play. Took out a ticket pocket that we have for having our photo and the monthly pass and used it to collect the coins that people gave him. The train stopped at the station where I had to get down. I took an euro and gave it to him! I still cant believe that I dropped an euro to a beggar. I had never dropped a coin to a beggar even in India! If you have read and digested Ayn Rand, a beggar cannot impress you. And if you are impressed by one, he cannot be a beggar! I was sure that he didn’t want money just to exist but to live. So I decided so. He too got down in the same station and I asked him to pose for a photo. He did and eagerly looked at the image I had captured in the camera. He said 'merci' and walked away without turning back. I took the map to read about the next train I had to take. I could not read it. My throat was choked with a heavy heart.I sat in the nearby bench and tears started oozing out of my eyes.I somehow controlled them so that they do not wet my sweater! It took me some time to get back to normal. There is something really wrong with either that fellow or the society in which he lives.  The day ended with these many things worth recording!  The next day I decided to take a walk along the banks of river seine. This river is seen as the reason for the birth of this historic city. I hoped that the sceneries would be good to  capture. Unusually, I was not dismayed. I started at the station of Gare de Lyon and from there started walking along the banks. Surely the panoramic views with the bridges, the Notre Dame church and the Eiffel Tower far away, is a sight that one should not miss. It was so beautiful. I could not believe in that heavenly beauty. What a fantastic scene! I tried my level best to capture them in my camera.  Along the banks of the river are the church and the Concierge building and Musee de Orsay museum and if we cut a little bit farther from the banks then and there we can see good monuments (of whose identity I am unaware) and pillars and statues. I came to the church and thought of getting inside again!  There are a lot of second-hand book sellers along this bank near the church who also sell paintings and covers of old magazines and posters of historic importance. There were a lot of books, but very few in English.  I saw a couple of pictures of Einstein with his quotes: 'Imagination is more important than Knowledge' 'If you have trouble with your Mathematics, do not worry. I have greater ones with mine!' Coincidentally, the day the 14th of March was Einstein's birthday. I thought he is right. A man can live a life without knowledge. Its no sin. But if he is living without imagination and artistic expression then he's no more a human being. I thought, 'Knowledge is Present. Imagination is Future'.  Just before the entrance I saw a man who was inviting people to be drawn as caricatures of themselves. I thought its a good idea to have a caricature of myself drawn. After a bit of argument that guy settled for 10 euros.Surprisingly, I said ,'Go Ahead'! I sat before him for some 10 minutes. He asked me to look at the side to get a good view of my facial features. I could see the picture he was drawing in his glasses! 'Where are you from? London?', he asked! 'India'. 'What are you doing? Student?' 'Software Engineer'. I felt a bit strange. When I look myself in the mirror I cannot believe that I am a software engineer. The notion of a student is, I think, better suits me and well deserved, because I have a lot to learn. He finished it and it was not what I wanted. I said thanks to him. Took a picture of him. While walking back to home , I tore away the picture and deleted his photo from my camera, since I didn’t like the thing! I cursed myself for wasting 10 euros just like that. I thought I would like a portrait of myself rather than a caricature which follows the whim of the artist.  While taking a walk inside the church, looking for anything that I had missed the last day. The same boring religious drawings and paintings! But still the church from outside is worth looking at!  After walking along the banks for a few hours, I returned to my room to re-fuel myself. Then I went to the Eiffel Tower to go to the top of it. I thought there would be  a mad rush since its Sunday and I was there around 5pm so that I could watch Paris from the top of it. To my surprise there were few people. In another half-an-hour I went to the top. I am an acrophobic and I was alone! I thought that anyway even children are there and there would be enough safety measures. There were and I didn’t feel any fear at the top. I discovered that my fear is not the height itself, but in climbing the height. Since it was inside a lift with lot of people , I didn’t feel the fear. But I could not take the stairs due to that fear!  At the top of the Eiffel tower, the view although not as beautiful as anything as looked at from the ground, it was a good one. Nothing special about Paris. I thought if Bangalore had an Eiffel Tower then it might look as good too! The only thing worth capturing from that height is the flow of the river Seine. I waited for skyline to get dark. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and I could not see the sunset properly. It was really chill and very windy at the top. But I was there for around 3 hours just to see Paris, the city of lights, lit. It drizzled a little too!  After it got dark completely, and when the whole city was lit, it was a good sight to behold. But its very difficult to capture those details in a camera. But I tried. And in that chill breeze, even though I was wearing woolen gloves, my fingers were trembling and the pictures I was taking, shaking! I would go to a calm place there, warm myself, take a picture and then go back!  I cannot forget the couples who kept on kissing each other standing at the zenith of the tower. I wondered why do they come to the top of the tower and try this stunt in this unbearable weather. They could very well do that in the warmth of their bedrooms with much more savour! I am kind of getting really annoyed of these French kisses. Indeed, couples who travel in metros do not waste their time. They keep kissing , happily ignoring the public. I kind of like that care-free attitude. To watch a beautiful couple kiss each other at such close quarters, as inside a lift, within a feet away from you, is a sight to be savoured every second! A note of a trip to Paris is not complete if it doesn’t talk about the French kisses, I guess! So now I have done that!  After taking enough of pictures, I came down.  So this weekend ended this way!  I think slowly the Paris-fever is running down!          "
"           The weekdays rolled on too fast to me that at the end of it I realized that the weekend was not planned properly. I just thought I would visit the 'village' Paris.  This week was a bit boring.  The theme of 'village' Paris included the area stretching from Montmatre to Batignolles and the museums Musee de la vie Romantique and Musee de la Eroticisme.  I was wondering what would be a 'funiculaire' train. At the foot of the Butte Montmartre, there's this train which could take us to the top of it where the church of Sacre-Couer sat. Its a kind of a coach on rollers on an inclined plane. I took the stairs anyway, not wanting to part with my euros. The church was beautiful. The weather was very cloudy. From the top of the hill, I had a good panoramic view of a part of Paris equivalent to what I saw from the second stage of Tour Eiffel. Lots and lots of tourists. Most of them were speaking English. Maybe one of the reasons why the guy who drew a caricature of mine asked if I am from London!  I went inside the church just to see if there's anything worth seeing! To my dismay, nothing. All of the glory of any monument here, seems to be interwoven with its history. Without that its just another good piece of a building. After the prayer was over, it was good to see people shaking hands with whoever sat around them for the prayer. I was surprised to see a placard in Tamil asking the devotees for donation towards the water and electricity of the church. Thought that there are many Tamilians around there to visit the church. Maybe SriLankans, as there are plenty of them in Gare Du Nord. There were a couple of street-musicians as usual there too.  Beside the church, there’s 'Place du Tertre' where were a gathering of artists who drew everything from caricatures to portraits to landscapes. Different types of them too. Indeed to watch them paint and to see their finished work was really fantastic and awe-inspiring. One artist told me that he needed 50 euros to draw a portrait of mine. I withdrew. But the prices vary greatly depending on the type you need. For  sometime I thought of getting a portrait of mine  done. But I thought its too costly.  To go to the museums, the map said that I had to get down the hill and walk a bit further.  When I got down the hill where the narrow street led to a wide road across, a big building stared at me with its huge neon sign reading 'sexodrome'! I was taken aback a bit. An English lady screamed to her husband, 'how the hell did we reach  this hell of a place? the sex place!!'. Both sides of the road were full of sex shops hosting live shows, peep shows.... Quite a strange sight for me who has only seen streets dedicated to jewellery, garments and the like!  I realized that I am in Pigalle.  The street was demarcated by the two metro stations Pigalle and Blanche.  Took a slow walk along the walkway to see the shops. The pictures that were displayed outside the shops, glaring at the passersby were quite obscene- the kind of pictures that are banned even in cyber cafes in India! Pornography is quite public here!  I thought that people who live here, can come to this place, perform the sin, go up the hill to the church and confess it and go back home purified! Quite a smart way to live indeed!  Along the road was the Musee de la Eroticisme! It was a small building. I entered it and saw that the entree[sic] fee was 7 euros. I looked around. The room was full of lewd statues and porno. Surely, I don’t want to spend my money here!  Then while walking down the street, a woman who was wooing the pedestrians into a shop, came running and said 'Excuse me, Sir' and began to pour out words in French. I didn’t turn back to her fearing that that might be taken as a sign of approval! I almost started running! Its quite a disgusting place.  I thought that I should not buy sex. Instead I should earn it. If I earn it, then it means that it comes with love and it'll take me to heaven. If I buy it, it'll become an indelible thorn of steel in my heart and given the kind of character I am, it would surely kill me! Its so fatal. So I'll better remain away from this. But the problem is, I always think that I am not smart enough to 'earn' it. There's a great probability that I'll be a failure in this regard. Its very rare to come across people who earn their sex. The majority satisfy their appetite either by buying it or begging for it or settling for something cheap. I do not want to do anything of these.  And when I think of Love, I realize that its so elusive that those who seek it will not find it. The choice is not ours but Her's!  The 'Moulin Rouge' which was glorified by the eponymous Hollywood flick, starring Nicole Kidman, is in this street. I went to the street again the next day night to take a picture of that windmill placed on that mall, lit. While taking the picture and returning back too, I was accosted by a man who showed a shining card and pointed to a narrow street nearby and said 'there are beautiful girls there, sir?'. Instead of running away, this time I paused and  said, 'No.Thanks'! After all, he too is a human being and in a sense, we both are beggars! The boredom which I go through is making me one!  Getting quite repugnant of the place and thinking of seeing those artists again at the top, I went to Place du Tertre and then to the church. There I sat at the steps. I was sweating due to the uphill climb and I took off the jacket and felt the chill air on my warm wet skin.  At this moment, I couldn’t quite grasp why, I felt really completely lonely. The old feeling of boredom which used to kill me while I was in Bangalore got its grip again on me! I felt tired and bored of the whole thing! Paris has failed to remove this sense of boredom from me. Then I started pondering about my favourite, unanswerable, ever-mysterious question of my career. Till now, I could not find what would enthuse me.  It seems that my mind is altogether inconsonant with whatever I experience, be it anywhere, anytime! I desperately want to find something which resonates with my mind. Or else its better to die, than going through this boredom and loneliness and the feeling of worthlessness. I am sure that with this sense of detachment to anything I cannot achieve anything in my life and am already a failure. But somehow this fact doesn’t seem to bother me. I always think that its perfectly fine to be a failure. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why I cannot find what I really want out of my life. Everything still looks meaningless, even though they are beautiful!   After resting outside the church, I got up with no specific place in my mind and roamed around the streets of Montmartre, which they say had inspired even some of the great thinkers who frequented the place. Quite a good place. Calm and serene. The narrow streets, typical of a village, without any tourist noise are good to be in.  Later in the evening I went to the village of Belleville just to see what’s there. But when I got out of the metro station onto the roads, the first impression of that place and the smell of it wasn’t good. To forget that hangover, I went to the 'timeless' Paris again, where I've been last week, to take a picture of Pont Neuf across river Seine lit in the night. As I expected, that place had a magic touch! I felt good again. Took some pictures and returned to my room.  Since I was bored this day I thought going of nowhere the morrow and went to sleep!  While returning to my room, in the metro, I saw a person who can neither be called a boy nor a man. Somewhere in between, like me. I liked his countenance. Lots of hair, clean cut of his nose and a 2-day old beard. He was reading a book and when I saw it I envied him! It was Victor Hugo's Les Contemplations. I felt like learning French to read Victor Hugo, Voltaire , Rene Descartes and the like - the kind of men who are keeping me alive and who make me realize that there’s nothing to get bored and there’s a universe to learn and contemplate upon. Its a  never-ending quest! I only wish to ask them, 'THEN WHAT?'!  I couldn’t sleep beyond broad daylight at 7:30AM.And again got bored of the room! So I went to Musee de la vie Romantique and Jardin du Luxembourg.   The museum, unlike what the name suggests, was not at all romantic! In fact I found boring portraits of the Rouart family of artists and a not at all beautiful woman artist called George Sand and the materials they used and even their hair sample! I wrote in the visitor's book 'Nothing romantic about this!'. Got really pissed off.  At times, while strolling around this paradise, I feel a bit of wonder to think that I am at the opposite side of the world , so far from India, wearing the same jeans and T-shirt which I wore in Bangalore. And I feel a bit of sadness when I realise that I had to return! Dreams only last until you realize that they are dreams! Now the dream has ceased to be.  I expected the garden of Luxembourg to be huge and beautiful. But it was pretty small, even though beautiful. Spent some time there and then went to Gare du Nord as usual to buy cookeries with my roommates Amarnath and Srinand and returned to the room.          "
"           Last weekend turned out to be another memorable weekend for me.  I thought that I have exhausted Paris and there's nothing more to see in it. I am grateful for Marc, who explained about the places to see in Paris and made me realize that I had barely seen Paris and there's a lot to be discovered and who guided to me to a bookstore in La Defense where I bought a guide. I had to start my sight-seeing almost from the scratch to be comprehensive.  So this week my plan was to cover: 1.Ile de la Cite 2.The Marais 3.Beauborg and Les Halles 4.Tuileries Quarter. But I couldn’t go to the last one for want of time.  It seems that every week I had to start with a church! So now it was St.Chapelle. The church, even though not as huge as Notre Dame, was quite impressive in its architecture. It had two chapels on 2 stages. The lower one was meant for the commons and the upper one seems to have been used by the kings. The lower chapel wasn’t quite attractive except for its roof which had many arches and was in a bright blue colour. A narrow circular staircase led to the upper chapel. Wow! It was so colourful and full of stained-glass paintings. But the tourists who were quite large in number made a hell lot of noise and the building reverberated it to my annoyance! I tried to take a good picture of the rose-window which depicts the scenes from old and new testaments. But my camera's zoom wasn’t good enough. One of the faces of the apostles there attracted me a lot with the calm in its face, carved so beautifully! You have to believe in something or the other to attain that calm or else you'll be pushed into eternal chaos and void. I would like to have a hairstyle and beard like that. If not for the damn tourists' noise I would have sat there for much more time. Felt that the environment was very good to sit and contemplate on something.  The marche aux fleurs et oiseaux (market of flowers and birds) was quite a treat for the eyes. It seems that the island was once famous for its flower markets and this is one of the very few left! There was a shop beside this for decorative items. The items were so beautiful that I wanted to build a house just to host them there!  Then I went through Rue de Arcole  which was full of souvenir shops to reach Notre Dame church. There were a few places there which I had missed earlier. Those are the point zero mark - from where all the distances within France are measured and crypte archeologique underneath which there are relics which are almost 2000 years old.I was looking for the statues of Gargoyles (chimeras) when I had been there before and found them now atop the walls of Notre Dame. Again my camera zoom was not powerful enough to capture them in close-up.  The woman who was in charge of the public toilet of Notre Dame church affected me a bit. She had quite a pleasant smile on her face always and she looked like an Indian. She was guiding the people to a free-cabin in the toilet. I thought nobody could have a passion for such a job and still she manages a smile.  Every street in Paris has a historic lusture. I was amazed to see a street sign on Rue de Francois-Bourgeois which pointed to 3 museums in 3 directions. Thought that one day or the other the residents of Paris will be evacuated for want of place for hosting the museums. So many of them.  I cannot forget Musee Picasso for the rest of my life for the impact it had had on me. I was quite half-hearted when I paid and entered the museum. But slowly I began to realize the genius of Picasso. It was so intense that it could pierce my ignorance of art. Mind-blowing imagination. Until then, my perspective of art and painting was that its just drawing portraits and landscapes and caricatures and theres no intelligence or analytical thinking involved in it. But many of the paintings that I could comprehend made me realize that I was egregious to an abysmal  extent. At first many of the paintings are quite inscrutable. I read the placards placed in front of each of the rooms explaining the importance of the exhibits and the phase of life of Picasso in which he drew them. Combined with a bit of imagination and absurdity, slowly I could decipher a few of them and those had a profound impact on me. What if I could understand everything? I would go mad! I used to think that only symmetry in objects and paintings would be beautiful. For once and forever I realized total incongruity can also be beautiful insofar as they depict the concept handled by the artist and the depth of it. I could see that at the start as an artist he too was drawing normal pictures and as he aged he paintings involved more and more abstraction. And also the subjects of the paintings like bull-fight, war, romance, sex, illness, death et al reflect the agony of their creator. And it was quite interesting to know that his wife ran away from him. Not surprising. They say that theres a woman behind every man's success. They forgot to add that he has to overcome that woman too to attain that success! They turn the simple task of life to an herculean one!  I was very much affected by a bronze piece of skull sculpted by him which reminded me of my mother's skull. Its still fresh in my memory and would be there till my head turns to one. The works which depicted illness, death, gruel war with dark and dull colours and which depict the frailty and ephemerality of life invoked sadness in me. Death is a subject which I am grappling with for quite sometime now and its unfathomable and quite disquieting! I believe that instead of trying to understand life by attacking it directly, I might get some light if I approach it by trying to comprehend its absence, death. They are two sides of the same coin. One inevitably leads to the other!  After going through most of his works and a bit of his biography I was wondering how could this world understand his complex conceptual works and allow him to rise to prominence. He is a genius inasmuch as he found a language to express his emotions. I was very much amused to see a group of little girls debating which leg belonged to which face in a painting and an elderly girl trying to guide them and make them realize the picture. I am ashamed of my ignorance of art.  Another part of the museum had his sculptures. They were works of a creative genius in Picasso. I've read about the bull-head created with a bicycle-seat and handlebar. To see that and to see many others like a goat's stomach made of a waste basket and a child in a trolley made out of iron pipes and pots was quite intriguing. It takes a genius to bring simplicity in chaos. This is exactly my state of mind - utter chaos and I am afraid I do not have the intelligence to discern the simple and eternal concepts behind them which runs this universe.  One more reason why I was annoyed with myself is my ignorance of the meaning of colours. If only I had that knowledge, I could fathom much more of Picasso. My heart and mind was full with pleasure when I came out of the museum for the only reason that I had discovered another language of expression. Quite a treat!   Then I went to the garden in Places des Vosges. Its beautiful with the surrounding buildings. There were lots of children playing there. And there were a group of violinists playing at a corner. There was a rush to hear to them. I envied those children very much. There's so much of art, music, poetry around and surely many of them would grow up as artists, poets, philosophers and musicians. No seed in a child would die of starvation of imagination and expression. Its a very appealing ambience.  In 6,Places des Vosges is Maison de (house of) Victor Hugo. There were a lot of paintings of his and the manuscripts and old posters of his shows were on exhibit inside. I didn’t know that he could paint. Everybody seems to have some knowledge of art and music. Its very bad that I didn’t study them. But many of the paintings depicted poverty and illness and other somber subjects. I didn’t quite like them. I would have appreciated if he had depicted glory and heroism. I equate him to those qualities. But it felt good to visit that house where its said that he wrote most part of Les Miserables.  The whole of the next day I spent in the beauborg district with most of the time in Musee National d'Art Moderne in the Pompidou centre. I started my tour at the Pompidou centre. Its strikingly different than any other building I would ever see. In short its a building built inside out. All kinds of pipes, elevators, escalators are outside the building! The pipes outside the building were coloured distinctively to symbolize their function like ventilation, water, air-conditioning, electricity etc. The escalator which takes us to all the floors was set up across the facade of the building which was quite an attraction. At first, I was not interested in the modern art museum. But I could go to the top of the building only if I take a ticket to the museum! So I dropped the idea of going there to the top to take pictures. The centre hosts a cinema complex - playing kind of art pictures. And from 19March to 17April its Bollywood special! They were playing chaiyya chaiyya song in a TV and then I heard the Hindi version of a song from the Tamil film Kandukondein Kandukondein! In the library there dedicated to art and industrial design I was amazed to see a book on Indian films with Simran on its cover. And there was a book on photography which was dedicated to human genitals! Really crazy!  Beauborg district is very small but its very beautiful. Last time I've been to the wrong part of it and thats why I felt that it wasnt the most picturesque. Place Igor Stravinsky, very near to the pompidou centre, has a lot of so-called modern fountains which were quite funny to look at. They seemed not to have been maintained well. Many werent working properly. But the place looked colourful.  Besides this place, there's St.Merry church. I went inside to see the old 13th century pulpit. The church was quite small. Many churches here have the look of Notre Dame.  Then I went to Fountain des Innocents and Forum les Halles. Forum les Halles is quite intriguing in that it has a garden at the ground floor and a big shopping complex, cinema complex , swimming pool, gymnasium in the floors below the garden! The building which surrounded the garden was pretty to look at.  After going to all these places, I entered into the Pompidou centre again.Got the ticket for the museum and went to the top!But I was dismayed to see that I could not get out of the closed glass escalators to the terrace or anywhere to take clear pictures.I could only take pictures from inside that glass tube!Then I went to the modern art museum!It turned out to be another lesson for me, like Musee Picasso.  Many paintings were quite indiscernible. The paintings were like scribblings of a kindergarten kid hung in the name of contemporary art! It was quite funny. But I was bemused very much with the works of artists called Cesar, Sigmar Polke(for Pasadena), Andy Warhol (for Electric Chair), Jean Pierre Raynaud(for Container Zero), Opalka (for Details).I could not quite understand container zero and pasadena. I noted all these names and works for investigating a bit on them! I myself felt strange. Many works which involved optical illusion and compression mechanics were also intriguing. Roman Opalka's details is a bit weird. The painting is nothing but a series of numbers. But the importance of it comes from the meaning given to it. Opalka seems to have wanted to do something that would only die with him and uptill then keep on evolving! So he decided to write numbers on a board. He started from 1 and I do not know where he ended. Only part of his work was on display. I could see numbers like 3309916, 5131330 and so on. When he finished one board of numbers he would take a photograph of himself. I think the total work includes a dozen boards. The colour of the board gets lighter and lighter starting from gray. The numbers are in white. So as he gets older, it becomes more and more difficult to read the numbers. What a crazy idea! I was wondering how much he should have been affected by death and the finiteness of life to make him take up this kind of a work.  Another artist that I should mention is Yaacov Agam. His is a fantastic idea. He hated the static nature of art and succeeded in bringing dynamism in it by involving time and motion. They call it kinetic art. A room was dedicated to one of his works. In a room, 3 sides , the floor and the ceiling contain some strange patterns. One side is ofcourse open for us to see! For once I was lost. I thought this is another one that I could not understand even a bit. But the silver ball placed at the centre of the room explained everything and the genius of Yaacov. I saw patterns of circles and diamonds and various other shapes. As you walk from one end of the face of the room to another you see the pattern changing! What a genius! What kind of painstaking imagination! Superb! That was indeed my favourite.  But my body got tired and hungry and I had to leave the centre to my room!  So this week turned out to be a week that awakened me towards art.Picasso and Yaacov Agam have lit the light!  There are abundant languages to express oneself. And I think the best and perfect among them is SILENCE.          "
"           This weekend I didnt spend much time outside and from the few places I went, the predominant theme seemed to be, my pet pondering, Death.   I started at Place de la Concorde.Its a majestic square.Only one side of it has a building and all the other sides are open.There were two fountains in the middle with 8 statues each symbolising the french cities.The star attaraction of the square is the 3200 year old (!!!) Luxor Obelisk.With the Eiffel tower not far behind, it adds to the scenic seduction, I should say.  Very near is Jardin des Tuileries.A beautiful garden.Its better than the one in Luxembourg quarter.Here I was accosted by a boy who had a similar build like mine but far younger than me. 'Excuse me,Sir.Do you know English?'.  I thought he's going to ask me the way to somewhere for which I had a prepared answer, 'Sorry.I am a foreigner!'. But he asked me to read a card,which read,'I am staying with my mother and brother here.We are from...(I forgot!).My father died in Bosnia.We are starving.Please give me some money'. These were not the exact words,but the meaning is intact. I read and looked at his face. 'Sorry!' and smiled.I still do not know why I smiled then! These kind of acquaintances, although very short, kindles my mind very much and makes me ask seemingly silly questions for which I have no answers and I had to decide that I went by instinct rather than reason, which is very sub-standard for a rational being. After enjoying the garden, I proceeded to Palais Royal and the surrounding garden. Nothing very attractive.  To go to the palace, I had to go through Rue de Rivoli. At the middle of it is the statue of Joan of Arc. It reminded me of the movie with Milla Jovovich as the protaganist. I liked her figure and the way she portrayed the character. Fantastic. Rue de Rivoli is magnificent and imperial. You suddenly forget that you are in a very modern city and feel like being in a period where an emperor rules the country. This is not the only place where I get that feeling, since Paris is painstakingly maintaining her countenance. They don’t allow buildings to soar so that all the monuments and other historically precious places are prominent in the skyline. That’s why when I look Paris from the top of any tower or a monument, I get a feel of being in 18th century with all its kingly glory. The road has a lot of shops and I went into a few of them, just to see what’s in there and how the shopkeeper looks like!  The second part of my day was spent in the Latin quarter. I think they are the prettiest streets of Paris in the evening with lots of boutiques and restaurants. It was very busy.  Then I landed in the place of the day, the Pantheon. The facade looks like the pantheon of greece. I pitied the poverty of the imagination of its architect. But its supposed to be an architectural feat. All I could reason for that feat is its difficult to place 2 huge domes on top of one another with lot of room in between and support them with only 4 pillars which form the end-points of the 4 aisles, with the plan of the building looking like a cross with a circle at the intersection of the cross. They call this kind of mix of Greek and Gothic architecture as neo-classical style! It means that its neither new nor classic. Its a confusion. But the facade with this greek Pantheon-like pillars and the peristyle of the lower dome , looked royal.  The space inside is vast.The place is the necropolis of the great french personlities. The names I could recognize where Saint Genevieve(the patron saint of Paris, who (she) is said to have saved Paris once from an attack of some barbarians),Victor Hugo, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Marie & Pierre Curie .I couldn’t go to the main place called the Crypt, which hosts the tombs below the chancel, for I had arrived there lately. In the middle of the space, at the intersection of the four transepts, is suspended the Foucault pendulum, right from the centre of the dome. I have to study what its all about! The walls had a lot of big backed pictures and pendentives. The spiral staircases took me, with lot of other tourists, to the peristyle, to have a panoramic view of Paris.I asked to take a picture of mine with the Eiffel tower far behind, in the colonnade, to the lady who guided us to the top. I gave her clear instructions on how the picture should come and where I and the tower should feature. She invariably messed it up! Somehow cameras or the photographers screw up my photos. All the passport photos which I had ever taken, except for the one in my Nortel ID here, have suffered this. Every photographer and camera seem to conspire against my face! So I ditched her and gave the camera to a tall guy and gave the same instructions. To my surprise, he took it almost as I wanted. I was happy. 'Where are you from?', he asked. 'India. Bangalore'. 'I am from Mexico'. Then I heard the guide cry something in french. I thought he is explaining something and ignored it and was immersed in a bit of day-dreaming. After a couple of minutes, when I realized where I was, there were nobody around. When I looked down, all the other tourists had went down. I could see them on the terrace down there. There was a door open. Then I came around the place to see if anybody else is there. When I reached that door again to go down. It was locked. For a moment I feared being left there. I started yelling 'hello' towards the stairs hoping that somebody would hear me. No reply for a couple of minutes. I pushed the button which was besides the door thinking that its some kind of an alarm. No reply for that too. Then I turned back. All the tourists were still standing there staring at me yelling. One of them shouted that the guide is on her way. I felt relieved.  Then I roamed around the latin quarter streets for sometime. Her I came across a treasure trove! Shakespeare & Co! At last I have found a book shop which sells good English books! It was very old. I forgot that the guide book had mentioned about this. There was an odd-tempered very old man owning the shop. The shop too looks pretty old. Theres a reference library in the first floor of the shop. Earlier I had seen one more bookshop in that quarter. But the books were all of those not so meaningful subjects like engineering and technology and science. But this one dealt only with those soulful, and hence comparatively although not completely meaningful subjects like philosophy, literature and art! I bought Les Miserables. When I came out of the shop it started drizzling and I returned to my room.  The next day I roamed around Montparnasse. Hell lot of theatres. Every street atleast has a couple of cinema theatres. And some sex boutiques too. Should look lively in the night. I saw Tour Montparnasse, which was, when it was built, one of Europe's tallest towers. This, I guess is the only skyscraper in the heart of Paris. All others are in the outskirts like La Defense. I didn’t go up the tower for it would have set me back by 8 euros!  The next place in my plan was to visit Cimetiere du Montparnasse (The cemetery of ...), one of Paris's biggest cemeteries. It hosts the tombs of many french prominent personalities across all the fields. I went to see the one of the famous existentialist couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, the couple I most envy. They dominated the 19th century philosophic and literary scene of France. I took a couple of small stones from their tomb as memento mori! Some names I would recognize there were Guy de Maupassant and Henri Poincare. I wondered at the man's thirst to be remembered even after death when I saw some strangely designed tombs. I wanted to see the whole of the cemetery but I had to go to Catacombs by 2PM and so I rushed through it.  For the first time, the map in my guide showed a wrong pointer to a place. Because of that I have to disturb some localites there to arrive at the  place of Catacombs. This is a very special place! Napolean, once wanted to clear all the cemeteries in Paris and clean up the city. So he dug up all those and stored all the remains of dead bodies under some 3 'mont's of Paris. One of those is Montparnasse and the place where he put all of the remains is called Catacombs.  I had to go down a seemingly unending spiral staircase to go to the underground storage place. Once my head started rolling and I had to stop for a moment to regain myself! At the entrance there's a warning asking weak-hearted and weak-bodied people not to take the journey!  Then I had to walk some 2 kms underground to arrive at the storage place. The walkway was very narrow and fearful, if alone. Thousands and thousands of skulls and bones. Wow! what a sight to see! Good that I didn’t miss this. For the next 2 kilometres of the maze-like dark alleys which were dimly lit, wherever you turn you see the skulls staring at you. I was petrified at the collection! In some places the underground water was seeping through the roof, making the walk even more difficult. For the next hour or so all I saw were those skulls, the emblem of Death. This is one of those places where I want to go again for I forgot to take a picture of myself with full of skulls and bones in the background. It would have been a marvelous photo.  Then again to come up to the city, I had to enervatingly climb those stairs. I was a lot relieved to see sunlight and brightness! And I was a kilometre or further from where I entered and I had to search my way back.  I was satisfied with the treat of these places and ended my weekend stroll!  Mother Death, it seems, is waiting for me to get matured to reveal herself! Till then I'll enjoy the fun and freedom of being immature.           "
"           With thoughtful books to read, With soulful music to hear, With beautiful places to stroll, With intellectual art and sculpture to tickle my mind, Paris is a paradise!  Sitting at the banks of River Seine, Wear Lucky Ali on your ears, Hold the little finger of Victor Hugo and ask him to walk you through his woods of ideas and now you know how heaven would feel like!  Wanting a change from monuments, churches and museums, I started my weekend with Bois de Bologne. Its a huge garden. Its the remains of a forest which was beside Paris which is well tended now. The atmosphere was absolutely serene, far away from the din and bustle of the traffic and noise of any tourists. Its the best an ultra-cosmopolitan city can do to take its citizens close to nature. There were many people seen around. They had come with their kids and pets and were having their time. You should be an idiot of a bachelor, like me, to go to such a heavenly place, alone without a girlfriend!  There were ponds in between with calm water with birds and ducks and pigeons. I roamed around for some time to drink the beauty and then settled in a calm shady place. I was disturbed by that calmness! To face silence has become difficult for me, for I have to face myself and my stupid questions. Men cant easily live in silence and solitude for they dread to be denuded by that one-word interrogation upon oneself which they have no guts or patience to face. So many prefer to inundate themselves into noise for that reason and die without ever attempting to answer that eternal query.  In the park, I could see a couple of young beautiful girls jogging, a married (hopefully!) couple, an old lady walking with a middle-aged man; maybe her son. How many roles do women play in a man's life from birth to death, I wondered! And I always wonder about the inherent duality of nature. Why should there be men and women? Why did not human beings choose to be asexual? And why should I allow this duality to screw up my life?! But without this duality, I realise that this world which has progressed from molecules to men, would have remained inert and be impotent of any reaction and procreation. Conflict is indispensable for creating harmony. But I don’t understand why should there be any progress or procreation in the first place. Why should there be something? Why not nothing? Isn’t that calmer? Isn’t that more peaceful? Isn’t that beauty? Why should I exist and experience chaos? I dont know. I am clueless. But all I can fathom is Chance and Change are twin directors of life and Love its producer! And I, the actor. How colourful it is, even though meaningless!  There were a lot of children playing around in the garden. I envied them a lot, as I did in Places des Vosges. I felt that this is quite a good environment for children to be brought up. India is not a good place for children to grow up and get educated. Not only that the educational system is hopelessly marred by the mud-headed politicians, but there's a complete dearth of role-models to look up to for kids; dearth of soaring of human spirit, dearth of order, dearth of discipline, dearth of planning and perfection. Children should definitely not be educated in such a place. Their mind would become crippled with the narrowness of their vision. The fundamental and primary objective  of a teacher is to show the ideal and then to teach how to go and attain it. But this happens rarely in Indian schools. No teacher is worth his salt. I have come across only three of the breed of good teachers in my school life, who deserve some respect. India is against the grain to impart soulful knowledge. All it can achieve is to produce meaningless software engineers like me! The calm of Bois de Bologne disturbed me a lot and I walked back to my room, not wanting to disturb myself further and in the evening I walked along Champs-Elyssees with amar and srinand, looking for a compact flash card for my camera and to enquire about the prices of cellphones for suneetha.  Musee Rodin hosts the works of the master sculptor Auguste Rodin. Its placed in one of the 'finest town houses of Paris'. The 'Gates of Hell' welcomed me. Its a very famous work of Rodin and I wondered how the hell he put all these pieces of bronze together. The house had a marvellous and big garden around it were the masterpieces of Rodin are kept. I couldn’t understand why the other sculptures were regarded as anything wonderful, thanks to my blissful ignorance.  Le Penseur (The Thinker) attracted me a lot, if not for any of its scuplting brilliance which I am incognizant of, for its simplicity and profound meaning.At the first sight it reminded me of Rene Descartes's 'Cogito ergo sum'.He is an exemplary thinker, who set out to build an entire philosophical system from scratch, not believing in any misleading logic, but his own reasoning. I was quite stunned to look at a photograph of him, for he shattered my pet ideas of physiognomy. To put his idea succinctly, denuding the benumbing abstraction of philosophical parlance, he proved that the existence of self is beyond doubt and we exist because we think. He looked a bit ugly outwards(!) as opposed to Rodin who looks like a sage. All this came to my mind with that piece of scultpture. Its powerful. And its so fitting that Rodin's tomb is below this statue.  Inside the house, there are numerous works of Rodin. I liked those erotic statues very much, for their expression. There are only a handful of emotions experienced by human beings that are so severe that however refined is the form of art used to express them, it would never be complete. Sex is one of them. Sex is sublime. That exalted state can be experienced, I believe, if I can check my sixth sense. That’s the reason, I guess, that every sculptor, painter and musician tries his hand at it, to gauge his mastery, against the infinite!  When I see the statues nude and get out of the picture to see myself and all others dressed up and standing there, I feel odd. It’s not the statues which look odd but its our dress! Its as if I dress to conceal my weak body with a frail frame. The statues make me feel ashamed.  In the afternoon, I had been to Tombeau de Napolean and Musee de l'Armee. The tomb (crypt)of the great emperor Napoleon I is kept inside a dome church. The church is quite majestic to look at. Did I read somewhere that it took 27 years to build that dome? What were they doing sitting on that rotunda for so long!!? But the gold gilded dome  with a cross at its zenith, with sun shining as best as He can through the clouds above Paris, it looks splendidly effulgent. Felt like entering the gates of Heaven after having seen the gates of hell at Musee Rodin! When I entered and beheld that massive dome from inside and the beautiful altar of a crucified guy called Jesus Christ, I felt that its quite a fitting place for that emperor's soul to rest in peace if at all it chooses so! Its quite amusing to note that he rose from obscurity to become a glorious emperor. He was extremely brilliant and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. He is also one of the father's of Paris's beauty. If not for anything else I would remember him for being a part in sculpting such a beautiful city. Its a myth that he was short. He was 5'6.5' tall, average height, but half an inch short of mine! This character inspired me to proceed further into Musee de l'Armee where there are exhibits of things used by the Napoleon dynasty and is quite comprehensive. It’s considered one of the best and wide collection in the world of the materials used in a war.  When I entered the museum I was still revelling in that erotic mood which Rodin has managed to create! But suddenly to switch the context from Love to War was difficult! It was quite a complete switch nevertheless, I should say. The museum educated me of the complexities involved in a war with all its exhibits of swords, daggers, pistols, guns, plaques, flags, epaulettes, uniforms, water-cans(!), heavy metal suits, iron masks, ornaments, bonnets, keys and various symbols used by the infantries and regiments. I was stunned by the administrative genius of Napoleon I.I was awe-struck when I came out of the floor. Sheer power. I felt very very puny before that emperor. He is what I call a Man. I felt sad that he was caught as a prisoner of war by England and was sent in exile to St.Helena on southern atlantic and died there. His remains were brought back here by King Louis XIV and was deposited in the Dome church. It was a bit ironic and saddening to see the set up of the prison room in which his soul departed with the bed and chairs originally used by him. He lived only for 52 years on this earth and see the legend he has left behind for us!  It was good to see that the seal of Napoleon I was N which is the first letter of Narayan, the King, too.  There was another floor dedicated to Napoleon III where I saw a rifle. The moment I saw it, I thought there should be something wrong with its design and it should have been very awkward to handle it. If I had been a soldier I would not have used such a rifle for anything. Its not good enough to kill in a swift way. Amazingly my suspicion was proved right by the plaque that read that it was an ill-designed lounge-rifle, with long bayonet (which was the root cause of my doubt!) at the end of the barrel, which was approved by the king and could not be used extensively and hence failed! So I observed that Napoleon III was not as good as his predecessors. Such is the incompetence that dynasty-rule produces. After this I got a bit pensive about the efficiency of the rulers in the systems of democracy and aristocracy. Terrorists do not jump from the skies onto the earth. They are the illustrious sons of democracy whose major achievement is producing incompetent and dumb-headed leaders who only know how to manipulate the sentiment of the majority to their whims. Democracy, in short is the mother of incompetence and corruption. Decisions at any level, from the individual to the government should not be taken by the majority. Majority of the decisions taken by the majority are hopelessly ignorant. Decisions and power should only reside with intellectuals and philosophers. All others, for the sake of good, should submit.  In the evening I didn’t go anywhere. Amar and Srinand taught me how to roller-skate in an open space in La Defense. I had a good time! After 1 hour of practice, I know how to stand up on my own with the roller-skates on! I had a lot of times deliberately avoided many things for the fear of success. I don’t fear failure that much for I am the personification of it! Then when I returned to my room I got a bit moody about success and failure.  Nobody succeeds unless and until he is aware of his success. And nobody fails unless and until he is aware of his failure. And if he is not aware of his failure, he loses the capacity to transmogrify a failure into a success. I bet that every man who had succeeded, in whatever way you define success, has failed marvelously. If he loves success, there has been umpteen moments when he has faced failure with love, for neither success nor failure is what he exactly loves, but the endeavour towards it. Its the journey that matters and bring true ecstasy, not the destination.  Here again I cant stop repining about my state. Even though I realize all the above, my problem is that I am not able to define my journey and make my sleeping spirit wake up and walk through it. Where there's no definite and conscious journey, all the so-called successes and failures fail to impress the soul. It starves. Journey is the soul of life. Destination is only as good as the body to the soul. As if I am standing uncontrollably on a roller-skates, which for the first time I wear on my feet and find it extremely difficult to get up and balance myself and almost impossible to thrust myself forward in a chosen direction, I am being pushed by the strong wind of chances which has any influence only upon those who have no sense of direction and is absolutely harmless for those who know where they are going, into the gates of hell. I feel that I am very near to those gates. But I can see that heaven is not far away but the next door!. Still I cant change my direction for I am stuck with the roller-skates on my foot which I had been wearing all along in my life, which is commonly called Ignorance. I feel like screaming to my throats capacity, for it would give me a ray of hope that somebody in heaven would heed me and take me under their wings. Hope! Unreasonably hope! 'You bastard, hope!', I tell to myself.  The next day I've been to a place where I long wanted to go after coming to Paris. Its Espace Montmartre which hosts the museum of the great surrealist Salvador Dali. Dali is considered as a genius in the art of surrealism. His strange mustache will itself tell you his character!  The first work which welcomed me was a famous Dalinian symbol of a fluid watch, which consists of a watch draped over a branch of tree. This flowing fluid image of a clock is the masterpiece of Dali which he exploits to the maximum extent. Its seen repeated in many more works of his. Dali's time is not precise, not rigid and it dances to our thoughts. Its subjective and an extension of human perception. He preaches, through his works, that man must learn to strike a balance between time and life, to maximize the gift of life.  There was a sculpture which depicted the nobility of time, with a woman symbolizing desire, reality and this material world and with an angel which is a simile for the deeply religious nature of a human being. In between these 2 there stands the Dali clock to preach that inspite of the other two feelings which drive man in his daily life, time reigns, with a crown on its head.  There were many more sculptures like 'Space Elephant' which were amusing. He uses egg to symbolize the intra-uterine life and re-birth. That’s a good idea!  I was able to appreciate even some of his paintings, thanks to the placards that were in English beside each sculpture and painting. He paints and tells stories in his own surrealistic way. He has painted Bible, Alice in Wonderland to name a few. When I was climbing up to reach the entrance, after I was done, I saw many poses of him with some questions and answers which were interesting. I could remember these: What is ugliness? Disorder. What is beauty? Harmony. Why do you wear (such a strange!) mustache? In order to pass unobserved! What is surrealism? Surrealism is myself. Do you think that a painter of your style belongs in our atomic era? Certainly. I personally indulge in atomic explosions.  After this I roamed around the beautiful Montmartre area in the streets back to the Sacre-Couer church. Then returned to my room and wonder about this subject of surrealism, which has always been with me, so beautifully portrayed by Dali. I thought that if his works are called and celebrated as works of a genius, I could produce thousands of ideas like those. After all I am a surrealist of myself!   N. (Inspired by Emperor Napoleon I and the '.' signifies that King Narayan is an end in himself!)          "
"           Thanks to Nellai(Nellaiappan Soundarrajan) for lending me his laptop to record my thoughts over the weekend.I missed gvim, for Windows always expects her users to be pretty dumb!  I would love to live and die in Paris for it treats me so well, even though I have no ideals to live upto or die for.   I was in Rue Mechain to start my weekend for the sake of Vidya, my teammate and friend.The administrative headquarters of the school in which she studied, the St.Joseph de cluny in Malleshwaram,Bangalore, is located here in Paris and she wanted me to get some photos of it.  The street was barren and it was drizzling a lot. I thought it would be a holiday and thought of taking some pictures of the street and the door of the building and return. Also since I could roam around only in the weekends, it would be difficult to come in the weekdays and satisfy her wish. After taking a couple of snaps I went near the door. It had no numeric keypad which most of the doors in the houses of Paris have, but a button to press. I hoped it was a calling bell. I heard a couple of rings on pressing it. No response. Slowly I pushed the door to see that it was opened. A receptionist welcomed me. I explained her the purpose of my being there. She asked me to wait for sometime and went away to fetch a sister. There was no school inside as opposed to my belief. But it was a mother house and it hosted a church.  While waiting for the sister, another sister turned up in that room and before I could grasp  her face completely, she thrust a T-shirt into my hand and said, 'Have it' and went away without waiting for any answer as if I am there to receive whatever they give! I didn’t want to act rudely there. So I kept the T-shirt, for I should hand it over to Vidya, who was the root cause for it!  The sister whom I am supposed to wait for turned up and took me to a small meeting room. After my introduction, I came to know that her name was sister Violet and she is basically a Tamilian, whose family is in Bangalore and who is in Paris for 6 years now! She started conversing in Tamil. She took me to all the gardens and the church inside .She started with a tree whose seed was sown by the founder of the institution, St.Anne-Mary XYZ, which was almost 200 years old. Beside the church is the crypt (the tomb) of the founder. She said that in the box kept there, the heart of the lady is preserved! Then she showed me the office buildings and the sisters' residence.  Then when we were walking along a garden, as if she could connect two different things, she asked, 'Do you know to solve computer problems?'. She didn’t know that she is asking a guy who has slogged in a call-center like a night-watchman troubleshooting PC problems! But that necessarily doesn’t mean that she would be as dumb as some of those US customers! 'Yes.' 'Then I have a problem with my PC. Will you solve it?' 'Sure.' The stroll came to an abrupt end and she took me to her room where the PC was.From whatever she explained I understood that PC doesnt play audio.Its 5 years old and all along it has been like that with the dumb speakers staring at her and the poor lady has been watching her movies in another sister's room!She had tried calling up the technical support for no avail.They had replied that the essential software is already installed!Then she gave all the CDs that has been supplied with the PC.Here in Paris, she explained that even if you buy a PC, nobody comes to your house to install it or troubleshoot it.She had set the system up herself following the instructions given in the manual.Good job, I thought.After fumbling around for half an hour, I could install the right device driver for her sound card and made it work.She played a Tamil movie DVD and shouted, 'Thank You.Thank You.', on hearing the sound. 'Do you eat pork, beef and things like that?'. I was taken aback a bit. 'No. I am a vegetarian. But I'll take egg too'. Then she took me to a dining room. And gave me cooked carrot, cauliflower, mashed potato and some bread and cheese. She made some coffee too. In the midst she brought some prawn pickle and told me so. 'What is it?!' 'Fish. Vegetarians eat fish. Dont they?' 'Sorry. I don’t take it'. 'How come you do you eat these bland things with not much taste?'. I kept mum. I thought curd rice is enough to keep me going.  After conversing a bit she said, 'Am happy to see you.', with absolutely no sign of it in her face. All along, until this statement I was comfortable. But the way she delivered it injected a feeling of uneasiness in me and I wanted to move out of the place as soon as possible. I hate people whose heart and tongue do not express the same. She came until the main road and showed me the way to the nearest metro station. By now I had grown very uncomfortable about her and the place. I walked fast without turning back.  Religion is a dead body. For me, a perfect religion is dynamic. Nobody can come out with frozen rules and regulations for a dynamic entity. Does it sound like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle on the motion of electrons? My religion should be shaped every minute according to the tune of my soul by myself. Only I know how it dances. That is religion with life, for it evolves with me. Once I freeze it and write down stringent rules to be followed, the soul runs away as fast as He can and leaves the dead frozen body in my hands, useful for nothing and which would stink like hell. The stinking body would only attract vultures to it! Vultures do not have the necessary competence to catch their own live prey. They wait for something to be dropped down as useless, to pounce upon. I can see these rapacious vultures in contemporary religious leaders.  Musee Grevin is equivalent to Madame Tussaud's of London, hosting wax statues. The entrance to it had long set of mirrors which faced each other at an angle to produce infinite number of reflections. I realized that the entrance fee was 13 euros and walked back. Not worth it for somebody who converts euros into rupees before spending!  In that area of Fauborg Montmartre, there are ancient shopping complexes. They date back to 1800's! Every shop is unique. There were a lot of cafe restaurants in which much of romance was going on. I thought this is the place where I want to be, for it has life and expression. I felt relieved a bit. There were shops for philately, vintage photographic devices, books from gay sex to history of France, figurines of every character that you can imagine for kids. The place had a Paris touch, which always leaves a pleasant feeling behind. Inside one of those shopping complexes and on Rue de Fauborg Montmartre I spotted a couple of chocolate shops, handmade chocolates. The smell out of those shops made my mouth water! They were so rich.  But still I couldnt quite get out of the bitterness of that mother-house. So I consulted the map and among the few choices I had, chose the farthest one! It was Parc de la Villette. The guide said it hosted a science and technology complex. Thought that the place would be interesting, but not as quite as art or sculpture.  But when I was done for the day, I was equally satisfied! Its personally a healthy sign that science and technology can impress me as much as art! It was a big complex with various centers like Explora which hosted the permanent and temporary science exhibitions, Cite des Enfants which is a children's science village, centers for shows and films, forums and conferences. I chose  to go to 'The Geode', one of the theatres there playing short-movies, which Marc had told me would be good. It was, indeed. The geode is a sphere. And hence the screen of the theatre is a spherical surface, which is the speciality, as we see in planetariums. But the films that are screened seem to be special documentaries. Each film lasts for an hour. I have to choose one among the 5 films; 'L'Inde' Tigre' whose hero is the bengal tiger and which is inspired by Jim Corbett who pioneered the Indian wildlife conservation, 'Adrenaline' which studies sky-diving, 'Station Spatiale' which is the story of the world's first international space station or otherwise an orbiting research lab and the people who built it, 'La legende de l'etalon noir' which is about the friendship between a lonely girl in a desert and a young black stallion, 'SolarMax' which depicts the humankind's struggle to understand the Sun. I could quickly narrow down to the last two.And the phrase 'struggle to understand' which prettily rings along the same line as  my state, decided the film.  They had given me a wireless headphone for hearing English audio instead of French and hence I could decipher and enjoy the film. The film was fantastic. It was written, produced and directed by John Weiley. It explained how our forefathers studied the sunlight to mark the start of the year, about Aristotle's geo-centric universe(I was very happy to see his face), the genius of Copernicus who propounded the heliocentric solar system, Galileo Galilei who built the first ever telescope to view the objects in the sky and confirmed Copernicus's proposition, how he was shown the tools of torture by the then government of his to make him accept that he is speaking nonsense (!).Here I thought that when there's a clash between an intellectual and a society, its always the society which loses the battle in the long run, irrespective of the immediate outcome , even if the individual is killed as is the case of Socrates, for intellectuals are dynamic and society tends to be static and hence falters. The point where dynamism should necessarily succeed the static rule is seen, by commons, as a revolution, which inevitably leads to another higher state and wait for another revolution to take it further above! It takes a genius of a character like Mohandas.K.Gandhi to design and spearhead a revolution without a single drop of blood. India, if not for anything else, can be proud for having produced this prodigal son who claims to have experimented with truth when I am struggling to discern it.  Art is waiting for another Picasso and science is waiting for another Einstein. This is how we climb the staircase of civilisation.  The two shows in planetariums, which I had seen in India, stopped with Galileo, as if he is the most recent and modern astronomer.But the film came far ahead.It went on to explain about the sun's dark spots, study of sun's composition through spectrography which was very neatly and  succintly put as based on the property of elements to absorb a unique wavelength of light to leave a unique signature in the spectrum, the way kids could easily understand, Berkelin's theory that sun spews out energy symmetrically through both of its poles and how humanity has to wait until man's first space voyage to confirm this hypothesis through videographing sun spewing out its corona, how earth is protected from sun's flares by its magnetosphere, how a couple of thousands of satellites placed around earth influence our daily life, how SOHO was built and placed a million miles from earth balancing exactly the forces of gravity due to earth and the sun to capture the sun's activity directly, how it was troubleshooted by the international NASA team for a silly mistake of their own which turned the system dead, where do we draw the frontier of science and technology now, role of the various observatories all over the world, how they form a chain to study the sun. A notice at the start of the film said that none of the images of the sun were created by computer animation, but were original images captured by various observatories around the world. I was very much satisfied with the film and its content and the way it was presented keeping in mind the level of knowledge of its audience. Brilliant.  I badly wanted something to drink and for the first time in Paris, I bought something to drink, a cup of Expresso Cafe and settled on a chair there.  The children I see here are pretty cute, with their rosy skin, blonde hair, tender lips, chubby jackets, faltering gait, questioning innocent deep stares. All over the world, children are the same. I feel like kissing these children on their cheeks and hugging them and playing with them and answering to their questions with utmost sincerity and successfully pass over atleast a part of my chaos to them! I want to grab all these nascent minds and make them grow as intellectuals. I was very angry then with the kind of range and method of education that the schools which I studied were able to deliver, when I wanted to learn something in my tender age and as good as now, when I was completely ignorant of my goals. I was very upset so much so that I wanted to build a school and create revolutionary concepts in imparting knowledge and which spews out nobel laureates! I would take pieces of coal as students and turn them into diamonds of immense value through the infinite energy of knowledge, by inspiring their elements to point towards one direction. I'll cultivate intelligence and harvest knowledge in the lands called their minds. I would make sure that these lands remain fertile by giving them enough nourishment from outside. I would deploy the best minds in this world to impart them the education. My school will have all the subjects ever touched upon by humanity and invent many more. Geniuses in art, sculpture, philosophy, literature, science, engineering, sports, music will be created. A student would pass out as a complete human being and a powerhouse of knowledge in his chosen field of study. The necessary and sufficient qualification for getting into my school would be the will to learn, the hunger for knowledge. And the necessary qualification to sustain oneself there, would not be the fee, but the love of his job. The system would be such that it would automatically eject out the incompetent or uninterested. Along the course of education from kindergarten to a doctorate every step, the tenure of it, the speed of it, the style of it, its composition, its breadth and depth, will be decided by the individual himself. There will be no admission based on age, race, religion, caste, previous field of study or any other bullshit. All  I needed were proper motivation and inspiration. I didn’t find one worthy blackguard who could deliver these. I'll create my own Men. I have never felt at home when I was in school or college. My children who study in my school will feel completely at home, with tremendous deal of motivation and inspiration around. This will come from the kind of teachers I have deployed and they'll be envied all over the world for the kind of pay that they would receive from me. I'll make these teachers, the gods of knowledge, as a bunch of richest men in the world. My eyes were hot with anger and as if to cool themselves they oozed out tears and they ran down to cool my face too! Its a shame on me that, for the first time, I cried in public. I said to myself, 'Get up. Don’t cry in public again. And don’t dream in public again.' I immediately mopped my tears and put the coffee cup in the dustbin and walked out of the place to the room. For the day, I can’t suffer anymore.  Since I am not yet 25 years old, I could visit almost all the places with 'reduit tarif'! This has saved me some euros. I had to give only 4.10 euros as against the usual rate of 6.10  to visit the Conciergerie.  The conciergerie is called so, for it was the office and residence of 'the concierge'( the keeper ) of the King, who was vested with lots of power. The entrance was a huge hall complete with Gothic archs. It looked royal. It has been originally constructed as an office but later many cells were added which made it the bloodiest prison in the history of France. After the great revolution in 1792, the accused who were thousands in number including personalities from all walks of life from peasants to emperors have been guillotined here. The prisoners faced only two options once they were brought in: freedom or death. Still I could smell the suffering of those hearts there, for the authorities have managed to keep the ambience intact and replay those events through documentaries and pictures well.  I could not even imagine the kind of suffering of the people who were sentenced to death would have gone through. If natural death disturbs me so much, how much these people on whom death has been imposed by heartless savages could have got disturbed? I wondered. It should have been a deadly agony for I read that some of them committed suicide with raw tools that they managed to procure there. The paintings there depicted the feelings who were guillotined en-masse in Place de la Revolution which is now the Place de la Concorde. Very somber. Man's intelligence is so paltry that nobody can ever manage to create a soul. I do not know who has any moral prerogative to put an end to one. No individual or government is qualified to bring an end to somebody's life, not even their own. Its the nadir of justice and the zenith of evil to award a judgement to a fellow human being as to end his life. Its not fair by any moral or ethical standards.  I came out with a heavy heart from that erstwhile prison.  Outside it was raining heavily and the weekend was marred by a pretty bad weather for sightseeing.So I returned to my room and continued my dreaming!  With her long lithe legs,  the lustful shape of the seat of her pants, the fatal curves of her pelvic girdle exposed neatly by her tight jeans, slender sleek waist, voluptuous bump of her bosom drawn by her skin-tight tops, shining shoulders, slender rosy fingers, svelte lines of her face, cherry red seductive lips, the lovely pink skinny cheeks, the wavy upperlip with its minute pale-brown hairs, the tip of the nose which has been made red by the blood rushing to rescue her white glowing skin against the chill wind which splits itself at that point notwithstanding the fast gait of hers, soft thick pink earlobes, the blue eyes which pierce into mine, the look of disdain as if she descends from heaven and I have dug myself up from the netherworld, the flaring forehead, the golden blonde hair which cascades down on her shoulders, the young french girl looks like an angel and disturbs me a lot. I've enjoyed seeing these features in the same fashion described atleast a few hundred times and I don’t think I'll ever get bored of it! The chill weather increases the need for warmth!  I saw the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life a couple of weeks ago. Her features had a deadly perfection. She was taller than me. She had the kind of face I would love to see every night. Being so close to me physically in a metro, her face told me that she is still unsullied. I couldn’t take my eyes off her blue ones till she disappeared from  my purview. Phew! It pained. I have not heard of a bachelor king. So my queen should be skulking somewhere out there. I should find her out. But how?!  Lets see! Lets Hope!  N.          "

"       Thoughts about the weekends' happenings in sports:  Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds FINALLY got homerun #500 versus the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.  A lot of people have been asking, 'Well, should Griffey make the Baseball Hall of Fame?'  I don't even know WHY people are asking the question: of COURSE he should!  Consider the numbers, first:  Only 20 players have ever hit 500 or more homeruns, and now he is one of them.  That's an elite group in my book, especially being the *6th youngest player (age 34) to accomplish the feat.  Griffey was also the youngest to get to 400, which is significant because it proves how much injuries over the last 4 years have really messed up a potential for a HISTORIC career, rather than a great one.  His career numbers, as of now: a .293 career batting average, .562 slugging, a .378 On Base Percentage, with 2143 hits and over 1438 RBI.  He's only 34!  Plus, he WAS the star player of the league in which he dominated (with Seattle) from 1993-1998.  AND he still has a good shot in the next 5-7 years of winning a ring (maybe even this year the way CIN has been playing).  Yeah, I think the guy deserves to be in the Hall.  Fred McGriff on the other hand, has played to long (19 years) and STILL doesn't have #500 (493), his RBI numbers are way too low for his career (1549), and he's just not as had an impact on the game compared to others that got in.  He is however.....  ....ON the hottest team in basbeall, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!  Can you believe these guys have won 11 in a row?  I didn't even know until this morning that they won YESTERDAY, never mind 11 in a row.  Too bad they play in the toughest division in baseball. They are 32-34 this year and 10/5 games behind the Yankees.  But hey, where else can a fan feel good while saying, 'Look, we're ONLY 10.5 games out of 1st place!'  All in all, just be glad that Lou Pinella won't have a heart attack for another 4 days........  Noting that milestone, it also makes me cringe that the Red Sox are now ONLY 6 games above the Devil Rays in the AL East.  I'm not panicking (or at least not trying too), but the Sox usually make a June Swoon each and every single year, especially during interleague play.  I think, if you are a fan, the things you have to focus on the most is that we now have Trot and Nomar back (and they're starting to play better), our pitching is still better than the Yankees (but their offense is WAY superior, kinda the opposite of last year between these 2 teams), and the fact that if you're talking Wild Card, that Texas (a good, young lineup that has average pitching) and Anaheim (a team that was my pick to go to the ALCS earlier in the year, but with all of these nagging injuries around the roster, as well as suspect starting pitching, they'll be lucky to finish 3rd in the tough AL West) are struggling, and with the Minnesota Twins/Chicago White Sox (It's like division 1-AA compared to the other tougher division in baseball) 'battling' it out in the AL Central, I think the Sox will be OK.    They just need to make sure they win each series against Minnesota coming up, and the Yankees at the end of the month.  It's a marathon, not a race......  .....finally congrats to South Africa's Retief Goosen on winning his second U.S. Open in Golf on Sunday.  I watched and laughed as Phil Mickelson completely had a brain fart on the final two holes and not only lost the Open, but also the chance for a Grand Slam (winnign ALL FOUR major tourneys - Masters, US Open, British Open, and the PGA Championships).  This guy has blown more big shots than Tera Patrick on a glory hole video.  Good thing he won the Masters last month, otherwise ALL we would be talking about is how much of a choke master he is.  He's still making more money than most people combined, I think he will be fine.  One thing ALL golfers must be happy with: Tiger Woods becoming a non-factor all of a sudden.  After dominating the last few years, he hasn't even been CLOSE to any of the major titles, never mind winning them.  He barely made the cut this time!  Maybe Tiger needs to go back to the Army to train, 'Abu-Gharib ' style, or maybe have Nike make some super golf shoes or something.  I'll be in Cambridge tonight @ Derek Gerry's Mounting the Hump show at the Cantab Lounge on 738 Mass Ave near the Central Sq T stop.  Show starts @ 8, and is FREE.

"       From Friday's Boston Globe:     'Boston is too racist for me,'' he said. 'I couldn't play there.'    'Only what guys have said,' he said, 'but that's been going on ever since my dad [Bobby] was playing baseball. I can't play like that. That's not for me, brother.'  When it was suggested the racial climate has changed in Boston, Bonds demurred.  'It ain't changing,' he said. 'It ain't changing nowhere.'  They built a tunnel to honor Ted Williams in Boston. What did he imagine would be built for him?  'Nothing, man,' he said. 'I'm black. They don't build stuff for blacks.'  ------------------------------------------------------------  O.K., why does Barry Bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city, huh?  I'm sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod, 'ain't', he'd probably blame that on 'The Man' too.  Does Boston have racist undertones?  Yes.  Even the Red Sox do (The original owner, Tom Yawkey, was from Tennessee and a former plantation owner).  If you ever get a chance, read Boston Herald's columnist Howard Bryant's book, 'Shut Out'.  Great stuff about how the Sox were the last team in the MLB to have a black player (Yankees were 2nd to last.  You see?  We CAN beat them at something!).  That was also the famed tryout of where Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Josh Gibson were on the Fenway grass and someone yelled out, 'Get those niggers off the field!'   The city itself has had a shaky history, I'll admit it.  We had the segregation of busing in South Boston during the 70's, the Charles Stewart dibacle, Bill Russell's house getting ransacked in the 'burbs, former Celtic Dee Brown being confused for a bank robber in a Wellesley bank when he was a rookie, and of course Malcolm X calling Boston, 'The most racist city in America'.    It's still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities.  Ever listen to WJAMN (Jam'n) 94.5?  Yeah, it's a 'Hip Hop' radio station not owned or run by black people.  Listen to it someday.  It shows because it sucks.  But the people in Boston arn't THAT bad!  This isn't fucking KKKtown, Arkansas.  For every one racist moment we have had, Anytown, MS has had probably around 20 to match it.  It's not like we're burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students.  Even black Boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have. And they feel more comfortable because of it. Look at Pokey Reese; corn rows n' all, he's by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year (AND that's including Schilling and Foulke).  Plus, if Barry had known Boston's history, he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state in the Union to record NO slaves.  He also said that Boston doesn't build stuff for blacks, where in fact, the African American Meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home (because they faced minor discrimination in white churches, and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats - but hey, at least the city acknowledged they're bigots!)  In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings, including a famous speech by Socalist Frederick Douglas.  See, Barry?  We arn't so bad when it comes to racism!  Maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city Boston is to minorites (And unlike in New York City, you'll even get a cab from the airport!), you would think twice about what you said.  Plus, we would EVEN build something for your arrival to prove we're not racist AND to make you feel comfortable.....  We'd build a needle.......a BIG GIANT needle.  You'll feel right at home.  Prick.         "
"       DID you see that god awful performance put up by the L.A. Lakers last night?  Phew, for an elimination Game 5 in the NBA Finals, they sure bent over nicely for Detroit like Last Comic Standing's Ant in the U.S. diving team's locker room (Kobe might have to get used to bending over if he gets convicted during this summer).    There are so many questions for the Lakers.  Will Malone retire (Yes)?  Is Shaq coming back (I think he is)?  Where will Kobe be in 5 months (I say he'll be on the Clippers........of the Eagle County Penal League)?    How about Phil Jackson?   Even last night while on the bench, he seemed to be so exhausted from managing so many larger than life egos and diffusing various time bombs for the last 5 years. It’s kind of like my seeing my dad in the backyard when I was young, cleaning his 9 mm while drinking cans of Miller Lite, sitting around fantasizing about when I will finally be out of the house, then looking at me and realizing that I’m coming back for another year.  I always said the one problem with the Lakers coming into this year would be their chemistry.  When you looked at their roster before the season on paper, and then looked at their terrible play last night, no one thought they would ever be saying things after the season like, 'Yeah, they picked up a Hall of Famer like Karl Malone, but the Lakers sure will miss Robert Horry.' or 'I knew the Lakers were done in January when they put 53 year old Horace grant on Injured Reserve.'  All kidding aside, at least those guys played together.  They were part of the system, they didn't try to be the star or say anything to disrupt the team's flow.  Even the young talent the Lakers have is promising.  Hell, guys like Kareem Rush and Luke Walton are the types of young talent you want to develop for your future.  Too bad they never got to shoot the ball, as Kobe was hogging it most of the time.  Kobe wasn't even doing what he does best - penitrating to the hole >:-)  I think Kobe and Shaq are done with each other.  They got their rings, had their moment, now it's time to part.  I just wish Reality TV pheomoneon would be the same.  These Lakers remind of you of every dysfuctional family that you see on COPS. Even during the Finals, they were constantly bickering, yelling and blaming each other in front of the police while at the same time incoherently denying that they just finished smoking a crack pipe.  Gary Payton sucked BALLS this whole year; he seriously needs to retire and get back to selling pot like he did in the early 90's.  They don't call him 'The Glove', for nothing (cause that's where the weed was in his car).   Hats off to the Pistons, though.  I took a poll on ESPN.COM that asked who was the biggest factor for the Pistons, and i voted for the WHOLE TEAM.  They just played together.  The coach Larry Brown got them to get what he was selling, and they sacrificed individual glory for the ring.  A real great season, a real great defense, and clutch offense........sounds like the Patriots!     "

"       A report out of  urlLink espn.com today says that Ricky Williams would have failed a drug test  if he would has played this year, serving a 4 game suspension (which means he's tested positive twice before).  And check out these pro-pot quotes (FYI, Ricky Williams has&nbsp;had a long bout with depression and was diagonsed with social-anxiety disorder,&nbsp;so he takes Paxil):    '(Marijuana) It's just a plant'       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   ''Marijuana is 10 times better for me than Paxil,'' he said.    From Dolphins head coach, Dave Wannstedt:  'We knew nothing about it,' Wannstedt said. 'I'm totally surprised and shocked again.'  He apparently has actually  urlLink gotten away with smoking weed while on the job for the last two years by drinking a masking agent that fools scientists on urine tests , and forgot to take this masking&nbsp;supplement this year&nbsp;before this year's round of drug&nbsp;tests(How can the Dolphins be suprised this guy smokes pot?&nbsp; Not only is he friends with Lenny Kravitz, he's got dreadlocks and admires the life of Bob Marley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they ever watched this guy at the lunch line?).&nbsp;&nbsp;   Masking agent that he used to fool the NFL (and ever since his retirement, has given tons of free publicity to)?    'Urine Luck.'       &nbsp;   That has to be one of the greatest names for a product, ever!    &nbsp;     "
"       So, Miami Dolphin running back  urlLink Ricky Williams is retired ; I say..............good for him!&nbsp; I totally support him quitting a life of football just so he can spend this fall/winter in the Fuji Islands smoking pot out of his bong.&nbsp; Especially since the fact that he was the best player on a team that plays MY favorite team (Pats), twice a year.  Although the timing is suspect, I again thank Ricky for waiting until Antwoin Smith AND Eddie George were signed on to other teams before he called it quits.  Maybe he is a closeted Pats fan, who knew?  The Red Sox need an outfielder since  urlLink Nixon will most likely be out for a loooooong time .&nbsp; I love Gabe Kapler, he's a good spot guy off the bench with great athletism and of course one hell of a right hand, but&nbsp;you you need someone who is more consistent with his bat, and has been in the playoff spotlight before,&nbsp;even though Kapler's hot right now.&nbsp;   I recommend either  urlLink this guy &nbsp;or ESPECIALLY  urlLink this guy .&nbsp; If FiInley goes to NY, that could mean Johnson is going right with him.  The DNC is here in Boston this week.&nbsp; My dad, who's a Republican&nbsp;cop that's working 24/6.5 (other .5 for sleep) shifts, commented on the chopper noise he's been hearing on his details:  'I hope John Kerry doesn't have any flashbacks about Charlie!'  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     "
"       First of all, what&nbsp;a turn-a-round weekend for the Red Sox!&nbsp;   They lose Friday night's game in a fashion that they ALWAYS do: Take the lead early, relenquish it via errors and a bad starting pitching performance by Schilling, then fight back to tie the game in the 8th just to lose it in the 9th under the cut fastball of Mariano Rivera.  This scenario has been happening for about 7 straight years.  Then something happened.&nbsp; Something I've never seen before.  Down 3-0 in Saturday's tilt, Bronson Arroyo (who's pitched better than his record and has more runs unearned than a tourist at a shitty* Mexican hotel) decides to hit Alex Rodriguez in the back with a change-up (which, if you usually want to hit somebody, you do it with a fastball).  *pun INtended  A-Rod tells Arroyo to go, 'fuck himself' (Thanks to Tivo for the mountless times I've watched this fight this weekend).&nbsp; Varitek, the catcher,&nbsp;tells him to, 'shut the fuck up'.&nbsp; A-Rod responds with about 11&nbsp;'fuck you!''s, and Varitek goes after A-Rod with a bitch slap,&nbsp;and then we got ourselves a brawl!&nbsp; Varitek takes A-Rod to the ground like he's his 11 year old brother, followed by Gabe Kapler absolutely bubbles up Tanyon&nbsp;Sturtze,&nbsp;(who was stupid in being the starting pitcher, going after the most atheltically fit guy on the team) who's now bleeding profusely like he's just gotten himself into a steel cage with Terry Funk.&nbsp; He has to leave the game, and in the process we knock A-Rod out of the game as well with an ejection......  SO, we win the fight........  NOW to win the game, which it looked like they wouldn't.&nbsp; After fighting back to take a 4-3 lead in the 5th, the Sox proceeded to walk about every Yankee hitter in the lineup and then fall down to the tune of 9-4 in the bottom of the inning.  But, this team, for the first time all year, shows some fight!&nbsp; Some spark!&nbsp; They come back to get the game close at 9-8 (followed by Nomar striking out, as usual).&nbsp; The Yankees get a homerun at the bottom of the inning and it goes to 10-8 into the bottom of the ninth.  Then, for the first time in a while, the Sox come back like they did last year.&nbsp; Nomar and Millar each get a hit (a rarity in the same inning), followed by&nbsp;a Bill Mueller walk-off homerun off Rivera in the 9th to take the 11-10 victory!  We win the fight AND the game.&nbsp; That's huge in for a momentum stand point.&nbsp; The Bruins did this 2 years ago, where they beat the shit out of Ottawa (at the time in 1st) on the ice and with their fist, then rolled off 10 straight wins.&nbsp; This is the type of game that CAN change things......if the Sox don't fuck it up.  It was really one of the more enetertaining regular season games, ever, in my history of watching sports.&nbsp; And it was a huge win for a team that needed it.&nbsp; Now they must continue to keep winning through this 12 game road trip to convince me, and the rest of Red Sox nation, NOT to open up the Thursday paper just for the Patriots articles.&nbsp;   Speaking off, good article here on the subject:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/26/sports_crazy       "

"        Rave : Gabe Kapler filling in for a 'hobbled' Manny Ramirez during the last few games versus Anaheim.&nbsp; I've always liked Gabe for the athletism and occasional hot bat he brings to the team.&nbsp; He's the type of guy the Sox usually don't have; they alwaysd go for the 'slow yet has homerun power' guys like Burks and Millar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope he continues his good play in Seattle. &nbsp;  Rant : Manny Ramirez's Hamstring.&nbsp; Is it bothering him?&nbsp; Is it a hoax?&nbsp; He is a robot like Dick Cheney?&nbsp; I really don't care, I just want the guy heathly enough for the Yankee series.&nbsp; He's so valuable, yet he at times can be SO frustrating with his often puzzled behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Francoma ain't helping the situation.&nbsp; The type of guy Freud would have a ball with. &nbsp;  Rant N' Rave :&nbsp; David Ortiz.&nbsp; WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!&nbsp;&nbsp; His good play over the weekend too just demonstrates&nbsp;how much the Red Sox need him, and why it was so unnessicary to throw 2 bats at umpires on the field after being ejected during Friday's 4-2 win.&nbsp; I'll say he will get a 5-7 game suspension.......but the appeal will last long enough that he&nbsp;will make at least 2 out of the 3 Yankee series this weekend. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Pedro, you're a funny guy.&nbsp; We love how you clown around in the dugout during wins.&nbsp; But during a blowout loss?&nbsp; Dude, you just need to chill and be a bit more professional.&nbsp; Or take some Ritalin. &nbsp;  Rave: &nbsp; A split in Anaheim over the Angels, very key.&nbsp; The Angels will come on during the enxt few weeks, so it was important the Sox came out even.&nbsp;&nbsp;They SHOULD take 2 games in Seattle this week, even without Manny.&nbsp; Seattle SUCKS. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Why haven't the Sox put in a claim on John Olerud yet?&nbsp; I like Dave McCarty, but Olerud is an excellent 1B who hits for average and is a seasoned veteran.&nbsp; He has had a subpar season with Seattle only because that team is older that the Bible.&nbsp; He might go under retirement, but still - the Sox need a guy like him on the team for the stretch run. &nbsp;  Rave : I don't know about you, but I would do a Shoppach, Alvarez,&nbsp;&amp; Nixon deal for Houston's Carlos Beltran ANY second.&nbsp; Love ya, Trot, but Carlos Beltran is a young star, and you're will always be an above average player who, in my mind, is damaged goods at this point. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     "
"       Great job by David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez reppin' the Sox last night with 2 2 run HRs a piece in the AL's 9-4 romp over the NL.  A lot of people say they should of been co-MVPs, but Alfonso Soriano's 3 run shot really set a tone and put the game out of reach.  Plus, it was a HUGE blast over the rightfield wall in Houston.  I am so glad that guy doesn't play for the Yankees anymore......he's actually developed patience over the plate, which is scary.  Bud Selig wants the 'The winning league gets the home field in the World Series' thing renewed.  Of course he does, because he's stupid.  Not only does it devalue a win/loss record for the regular season, it also pins a square advantage to someone in a championship series via an EXHIBITION game!  That's like giving someone the White House just because he only won the state of Florida........  Going into Stage 10 today, Lance Armstrong is in real danger of losing the Tour de France for the first time in 5 years.  I've always found it ironic that in France's biggest race (a country known for surrendering and pissing on people), the leader and winner of the race gets a yellow shirt.  I don't know why everyone outside of the USA is in a tussle over Lance's alleged doping.  The guy had testicular cancer!  I think he's allowed to take steroids after getting a nut cut off!  If there's ANYTHING that critics should go after, it should be the fact that Lance has a huge speed advantage by being 2-3 lbs lighter for only having that one nut.  The critics sure dropped the  ball  on that one (ok, I'll stop).......  I hope Randy Johnson does come to the Red Sox, not only to help them win a World Series, but maybe he can put a huge dent into this over population of pidgeons we have in this city.  We used to have a big rat problem around here, but it got taken care of because those rats evoled and grew wings.  When you see 4 albino pidgeons having breakfast at *2* different Dunkin Donuts', they're fucking too much.  Pidgeons are the one of the many reason's the NRA could be a fun club to be in.  It would be like duck hunt, except the dog would be replaced with a cat.......armed with lasers.     Big series coming up in Anaheim this week.  And they need to win more than we do so they can look more attractive to the 'Big Unit'.  Speaking of being attractive to units, a sex video shot by a former husband of Baywatch blonde beauty Gena Lee Nolin (warning!  not work friendly! http://www.anothersite.co.uk/gena-lee-nolin.htm ) is out.  I was very impressed because it's her best acting performance she's had since.........wait, she could never act in the first place.  But she sure can play it up for the camera!  Now THERE'S talent!   Gena.....Hey now, you're an All Star!          "
"       Well, it's baseball's all star break, and we're 86 games through the season.  The Sox stand at a decent 48-38 clip, a game ahead of the wild card over Oakland and 7 games behind the Yankees, who I still think arn't that good.   Who would have guessed that the Sox AND Cubs would be 7 games behind in their perspective divisions?  These teams have so much talent before the season, that's like saying that Jimmy Fallon AND Nicole Richie will get Oscars by the end of the decade.  I was at the game yesterday, still pretty bummed how they lost.  Those umpires SUCKED, they had a major case of, 'We want to go home-itis'.    At least my DAG % (Drunkness At Games percentage) is still at 1.000.  Jesus HAS reincarnated himself as Johnny Damon (for now).  I mean, look at the similaries!  The hair, the closeness of the initals (JC, JD), and the many miracle plays over the past 8 games.  Now if he can only turn the warm Bud Light drafts at games into GOOD beer.......  Roger Clemens to the Red Sox, right?  Sounds good and look good right?  *SMACK*!  It's never going to happen......  Randy Johnson MIGHT still go to NY.......but odds are he'll go to Anaheim (if they play well in the next 12 games).  The Red Sox in my baseball season on EA's MVP BASEBALL 2004 are 60-26.  I'm the man, and so is Nomar, who in my season, is hitting .354 with 34 HRs and 70 RBI with a .400 OBP.  Barry Bonds is hitting .415!  NCAA Football 2005 comes out July 15th.  Madden 2005 comes out 2 weeks later.  Two MORE reasons why I don't need a girlfriend........  Sitting in the bleachers yesterday drunk off my ass looking at cute girls in skimpy Red Sox clothing the ONLY reason to have a girlfriend......  Shaq to the Heat?  That's OK, ain't like the Celtics are going to win the division for the next 10 years, anyways.  A show at the Cantab Lounge today on 738 Mass Ave near Central Sq on the Red Line.

"       Hey folks, sorry I haven't been posting for a while, but it's been a busy week for me with the July 4th holiday, a great end to the fiscal year at my job (which came with a nice bonus at around 4 figures), fishing in Falmouth, playing poker, and of course, the drunken 6 day therapy binge I have gone through with the Red Sox over the last week.  I haven't wrote anything basically because I was physically zapped by watching all 6 of these last games versus Atlanta and New York.  If it wasn't for Curt Schilling, I would probably done a Charles Stewart and jumped into the Charles River right now.  That's how frustrating it is, and it's only the beginning of July.  As many in the nation (including the Reverend Tim about to hang himself) have witnessed over this past horrible week, one has to conclude and ask:  Do the Red Sox actually have a chance to be, agasp, competitve this year?  They're now 3 games over the Devil Rays (I can't believe I just wrote that) and pretty much heading into a (they have to at least win 4 out of the next 6) big homestand versus AL West and Wild Card contenders Texas and Oakland.  They are currently 9 games behind the NY Yankees, and unless a collapse by NY happens in the last 81 games (which could happen, as bad as the Sox are playing now, NY has serious issues with it's starting pitching and just got over a sweep by the rival NY Mets), the Sox will have to be thinking Wild Card....again.  wITH THE STRUGGLES AND STEADY DECLINE, HOWEVER, ONE NOW HAS TO CONSIDER - DO WE BECOME SELLERS AT THE TRADING DEALINE?  a) Nomar sitting on the bench during the 13 inning debacle still gives me fits (and for once, you could argue that Nomar should have stuck it out for at least one inning so Crespo should have been in the game over Millar in rightfield, so that Cairo ball doesn't turn into a double).  Nomar is also not the .330/30/110 guy he used to be.  And he's a free agent who's already rejected a 4 YEAR 60 MILLION dollar deal (wha?).   He's going to the Dogdgers....so why not get Cesar Izturis and Odalis Perez in return?  b) Derek Lowe pretty much psyched himself out of any type of talent since rejecting his 3 year, 27 million dollar deal and putting tons of pressure on himself to pitch well in his contract year.  Oh well, Derek; have fun going out in the free market: 'Will Walk for Free Food'.  Too bad he's pitching so bad they are talking about putting him BACK in the bullpen.  He needs a psychiatrist like I need to get laid.  c) And Kevin Millar, who suprises me every time he's on the field, because his career died about a year ago after hitting .220 in the last half of 2003.  He just dyed his hair blond too.  Hey Kevin....BOY BAND UP!    Plus, why is HE the KFC spokeperson?  He sucks!  People will REJECT KFC now that he's promoting it. I think Pokey Reese would be a much better choice.  SO, if this team doesn't get on a streak, and soon, these guys will be the first to go.  And I think a deal should be made reguardless because this team needs a change.  It's too comfortable.  And too poisitive, thanks to 'I won't sacrifice' Zen Master and Moby look-alike Terry Francona.  Thanks to the Moneyball/Murphy's law 'defensive errors happen' theory, the Red Sox now make more errors than the Bush Administration.  Terry's a nice guy, but he's not a good manager.  Aargh!!!!  I told everyone they should have hired Bobby Valentine!  They're are some good things about this year that make you still have hope.  There are the Sox All Stars in Schilling, Ortiz, and Manny.  And Pedro has been real optimistic in his quotes over the last few days.  When things usually went this bad in the past, he usually uses the 'my 5th grandmother got sick' excuse and goes into seclusion into the Dominican Republic for 7 days.    And they are always the Patriots.  One movie that made me feel good about all of this that I saw today was, 'Major League'.  You take away a few things from the movie: like the fact that Cleveland sucks, Charlie Sheen is a great method pitcher, the mystery of Corbin Bernsen's career, and that Pedro Serrano, despite hot being able to hit a curveball and worshipping the peagan god, Jobu, will still eventually become the President of the United States someday.    The main goal of the movie, though, is that it basically reminds fans that if you keep the faith, you'll eventually get a winner.  I say to Sox fans, just look at the bright side in that they are still 81 games left this year, and thank god for the Wild Card and 4th place!    As Jack Byrne says in the movie, 'We're somehow still in this thing'.    "
"       Here are some news and notes in the world o' sports:   Out of Red Sox injury report : Reports  urlLink have claimed that reliever Scott Williamson's right forearm  has swelled to twice the size of a normal forearm. Why is this a problem? After all, it never seemed to keep Popeye out of the bullpen; just give him less spinach, he'll be fine.   Notes from last night :   urlLink Tampa Bay left fielder Robert Fick's  last name means 'fuck' in German. That gives him the most obscene name in the majors since the retirement of   urlLink Rusty Kuntz (not making this up)  .   Soccer : The French National Soccer team has recently named Richard Fucka to their Olympic squad.   Dick Fucka will be a key role player off the bench, as he will provide distraction in laughter from the other team everytime he turns his back.   Football News :  Since retiring because he failed a pot test, Ricky Williams is now in the process of chasing a film career.  Since he, and follow running back and Raven's star Jamal Lewis (who's on trial for laundering money and cocaine trafficking) will have plenty of time on their hands, they are now in the process of filming the comedy,   'Ricky and Jamal Go to White Castle'.    If Jamal can get to the set, expect to see this movie in about 20 years to life.   Basketball :  Former Los Angeles Laker Rick Fox is divorcing wife Vanessa Williams (Vanessa Williams!), citing irreconicible differences and potential infidelity by Fox.  Apparently, Vanessa (Vanessa Williams!) is not quite good enough for his L.A. acting lifestyle. (Vanessa fucking Williams!) Too bad he's heading back to Boston in a trade that happened last week.   Remember Boston, Rick?  I live here now; good luck finding L.A.-quality hotties.   You'll still get laid for who you are, because most Boston women are tools, but you won't find any L.A. quality hotties.   Basketball :  Rick Fox has now reitred at the age of 35 after comedian Sean Caulfield reminded him of how much Boston is a sausage fest and why the female dating pool here mostly sucks.   Sports business :   urlLink Madden NFL 2005  for all videogame entertainment systems comes out today in select locations.  On a personal level, I am psyched because I had Terrell Owens and Corey Dillon traded to their new teams in the 2004 Madden franchises before they actually were.  By the way, I haven't had a girlfriend in over 4 years.  See bitterness above.   Olympics :  Yeah, I couldn't make any jokes about it, either.   Girls are hot, though.          "
"       So Nomar is gone as we all know, and I say, good for him, and good for the Red Sox.   He wasn't going to stay, and he was acting like a bitch the last few weeks because he wasn't getting any attention, and he wanted to be healthy for free agency.   'I called him in his hotel room just to wish him luck and thank him for all he did for the franchise,' Sox CEO Larry Lucchino said last night. 'Then I asked him, 'How's the heel?' He said, 'It's great.'' '(I said,) 'Great? How can it be great? Two days ago, you thought you were going to have to go on the DL.' He said, 'Yeah, well, it's great now.''  Sox sources even alleged that Garciaparra said that he wanted to make sure he was healthy at the end of the season, when he would have to take a  November physical  as part of the free agent process.    The Sox (and new ownership) weren't going to resign him, and were offended when he rejected a 4yr/15m dollar contract last year.  So, pressured to make a deal, Theo though we might as well get some players out of this before he leaves for free (Cabrera isn't a bad player, and that play last night wasn't his fault - that's Terry's for not telling him the correct relay position.  It's ALSO terry's fault that Pedro wasn;t in the game in the 8th inning.)  Nomar was being a cancer in the clubhouse, despite the fact the guy DOES play as hard as he can while in there (and produces with stats).  But the other players were tired with the, 'woe is me' bullshit, and Nomar was tired of the daily soap opera that is Boston Red Sox Nation.  The problem with Nomar, as we are now finding out, is intangibles.  You never know what to get with Nomar (see: sitting out 13 inning games versus Yankees this year), even though statistically (and even physical talent wise) he has the greater past.  Remember when Sox and Yankee fans used to debate whether Jeter or Nomar was better?  Well, the debate is similar to 'Who's career will be better? Michael Jackson and Prince?'    Michael Jackson, early in his career, was a young and hot talent.  A young prospect with great dancing talent from the Jackson 5, he came out solo and was winning awards.  He carried on his family's tradition.  He was the face of pop music, making millions..............  All in while Prince just kept the consistency turning out hit after hit, being original and gaining a fan base, making a movie, and maybe not outselling Jackson, but doing enough to be a force. He was making money and being a big player in music.   Then, MJ fell off the face of the earth when he became a white pedo pop queen; while Prince became a Jehovah's witness and STILL continues to make good, solid albums that quietly get the job done on the charts.  He OUTLASTED him.  As Chris Rock said, 'In the end.....dat nigga Prince won!'  Quietly, with a little flair, and consistency.......that's Derek Jeter.  Just like Prince, you know he's going to come around again and again and never disappoint, especially in the clutch.  He was never GREAT in terms of stats (or album sales or in dancing talent when comparing Prince to MJ) but you know what you're getting with him: a true leader and gamer who'll play every game with blood and sweat all while batting .310 with 15-20 HR and 80-90 RBI,  and a .400+ OBP with over 100 runs scored; and of course......banging hotter chicks (which is true in BOTH cases).  Nomar?  Once a much better player in the field and on the plate, his numbers have decreased over the years.  He can't play everyday (Orlando Cabrera, can) .  His defense isn't what it used to be.  His heel, ankle, and wrist are a concern.  A 2 time batting champ and once hitting .325 with 30/100+, now he's about as good as Jose Valentin with a little better batting average.  Oh, and his OBP STINKS (partly due to his philosophy at the plate, but every time Nomar popped up I wanted to kick MYSELF in the nuts).  I think that's why we had to give the Cubs an extra prospect.....because THEY knew what the risks where in getting this guy.  He's a head case (just look at him in the plate).  He was the most paranoid player in Boston sports history; the media gave him good press, and the fans (esp. kids) loved him, and he still thought everyone was out to get him as if he was Alex Jones at a Republican dinner.  Like Drew Bledsoe, it was time to go.  Time will tell if Nomar will take a page ad in both the Herald and Globe to at the least, thank the fans of Boston who loved him and remembered the GREAT times (1997-2000), even when frustrated (this one included).  He needed a change, and so did we.  We gave up a great shortstop, but we got depth, defense, and some intangibles back (Doug Mient....whatever his name is a good friend of David Ortiz, and is a leader.)  Only time will tell in wins and losses (and where Nomar goes next) whether how things will play out.       "

"                 I love the summer before the Olympics because all of the fun sports events are on!  Screw football and basketball!!!  Baseball is a fun event to attend during the summer- but I am talking about Wimbledon every summer and lovely gymnastics, swimming and diving trials up until the August wonderfulness that is the Olympics.  This may be sexist but I feel like so many women who wouldn't be caught dead watching football, baseball or basketball are VERY into the Olympics.  I don't know what that is all about, but it definitely describes me.  But, let's back up to Wimbledon as I pay homage to all of the hot men that I have watched over the years.  None of them play anymore, sadly, but they still live on in my heart!  First and foremost, Mr. Pete Sampras.  I was OBSESSED for years!  Just ask my parents who were forced to listen to me freak out everytime Pete missed a hit or got a double fault.  This year, my second favorite tennis man retired- Goran Ivanisevic, hot Croatian man who finally won Wimbledon in 2001 after getting beat by many including Pete Sampras (a painful match for me to watch!).  Runners up are Ivan Lendl (old school!) and Patrick Rafter (yum!).  I love them all and will remember them fondly...until some new hot young thing begins to play...hehehe!  Back to the Olympics, I am very excited about them.  I have been watching the Olympic trials for women's gymnastics and I think we are going to take control and be awesome ala 1996 (in Hotlanta!).  Go women's gymnastics and all the hot men on the USA team, I will be all about it in August!               "
"                 I know it is Tuesday, but I am finally telling about my weekend.  Friday:  This night consisted of drinking a lot and bar hopping in the hot town of Sherman Oaks with my friend!!!  The Mexican food was yum but the bars were so-so.  But that is okay, because there was drinking involved!!!  We went to dinner, four bars, managed to confuse the valet by taking the keys to the car with us instead of leaving them (haha!)- and all this before passing out around midnight!  woo hoo!  Saturday:  The fun didn't stop woo!- I attended the Playboy Jazz Festival with friends of the family every year.  Actually, this is my second year attending, and I decided to bring my friend who with me to enjoy the festivities.  Despite it being the Playboy Jazz Festival- it is an affair at the Hollywood Bowl (sadly, not the mansion) and it is hosted by Bill Cosby.  It involves listening to jazz and eating and drinking all day long.  I love it!!!  If you have binoculars or are in really good seats then you can see Hugh and his lovely(?)ladies enjoying the festivities.  My friend and I started the margaritas around 12.30 and we met a bunch of people who are older than us and nice little married couples (bleh!) but they were quite entertaining when they started the drinking.  And they had food...which always wins in my book!  We left the Jazz festival early to hang out with another friend and go to a party at the Crescent Hotel (again!).  This is where, as I mentioned in an earlier post, the hot manager guy is.  I learned that his name is David and that he is willing to have babies with me!  Or at least that he is willing to make a drink for me and to tell me to come inside because of an LA county ordinance.  LOVE!  I know it!  The night ended with my friends and I scarfing down food (mmm potato skins!) at the formerly ghetto Jerry's on Beverly.   Jerry's used to be very ghetto on late weekend nights- I once went there with friends, one of which was a small drunk Asian British girl who liked yelling that she was 'ghetto fabulous' to all of the people around.  I think they just didn't understand her, therefore we didn't die!  But a fight ensued behind her so we came close...later in the year we learned that Jerry's got the smackdown because someone got shot there.  But it is all good now!  yum!               "

Minorities can bond like this, and no one likes his kind anyway anymore, they are so last decade!).  I don't plan to be political or to have fabulous things to say, just my observations on my own life and the general world around me!!!  I will keep friends out of it unless they do something very funny!!! wheee!!  On the hot men front: For any LA people who are reading this- go to the Crescent Hotel and check out the hottie manager there, yum!!! but he is mine!  you can drool but don't touch!  On the relationship front:  I have now realized, through mine and my friends' recent experiences, that women 25 and up have hit that time where they switch from dumping boys to being dumped.  What is up with that!! I dumped many a boy in my time with no second thoughts, and now I am getting the royal workover, who do these guys think they are?? I went to Wellesley dammit, I will own all of you measly boys one day!!  Thank you and good day!               "
"                 If you are reading this, you might wonder why part of the title is 'the misadventures' (I take it, if you know me, you know why it is called Action Jackson!!!).  Well, in order to thwart the impending quarter life crisis that I and most of my friends could embark on in the next months or years- I am starting this blog to make fun of my future activities.  As of now, I am looking for a new job and a new man- the latter activity alone could provide hilarity!!!!  Success of either could help with the mountain of college and grad school debt that is hovering over me like a mosquito in an Atlantan summer.  SO- the misadventures begin!  If you can help out with any of my activities- let me know, save me from the embarrassment of it all!!!   To get things going, my all knowing mother decided that she would make some demands of me today that involve my goals (paying debt, finding man, finding job!).  The demand: Join the Alumnae Associations of your schools.  Not a bad idea I thought- I paid lots of money and studied sort of hard for these diplomas and now I must bleed the alumnae associations for all they are worth.  So, as of tonight, I have sent out multiple emails to Wellesley and LSE and I have even joined the Ivy/Seven Sisters Singles group.  Yeah, fun with Ivy leaguers...let the games begin...

"                 This new show, Amish in the City, is my new favorite reality show!!!  I am officially addicted.  It is about 5 Amish kids during the time that all Amish teenagers have to decide if they want to be Amish for the rest of their lives (rumspringa).  And they live with 6 'city' kids.  The city kids were so rude at first because they thought it would be hook up and party central until they met the Amish kids.  So embarrassing for all us city kids to see.  But they all, for the most part, get along now- I am sure normal Real World type drama will come soon enough!    But, for any of you who may have watched the show, I have to say that the guy, Randy I think, is the biggest waste of a hot body I have ever seen. When he doesn't talk or anything, he is SO hot.  Then he opens his mouth and his grill is JACKED and then he talks, seriously, like a high pitched girl.  WHYYYYYYY!!!!! So sad!  Check it out!               "
"                 Okay y'all- my project for the last few weeks was to figure out my finances.  I have learned a bit, many of you might already know a lot, but if you don't- I suggest you figure out you bizness now!  I am poor now and don't want to be poor later!!!    What I learned:  1. Save the first hour of your salary every day and put it into a mutual fund.  2. Open up a Roth IRA for retirement purposes.  3. Be involved in investing said mutual fund and make it grow!!  This is a public service announcement brought to you by the letters- A and J and by the company 'Make lot of money so I can visit your ass in exotic places, Inc.'  No seriously, I don't want any of us to be broke and old- that would be horrible- and on another related note- during this election year we should get more involved in what is going on with our generation because the incumbent and candidate won't really care about us unless we make our voices heard.

"                 I felt the need to have a hit counter on my blog because I can kind of tell if people are checking it out or if I am just talking to myself.  I often talk to myself so it wouldn't be a horrible thing.  But what seems to be the worst is a few hits as opposed to none at all.  Is everyone reading once and then saying 'this shit is lame' and then moves on to the tried and true blogs of Wonkette and Gawker???  It make me sad...so I need some help from the few who read.  Pad my hit counter kids, stuff my ballot so to speak!  I need to live in a bubble in which people check my blog a lot so I don't feel unloved!  You  may call it low self-esteem, I call it continuing my dream world...refresh people refresh my blog again and again!  ...or maybe I should just take it off...thoughts???               "

"                 So, one of my good friends has left the lovely environs of LA.  That leaves me with about 2 close friends left in LA.  Down from 20 or so friends that I had from my grad school program and from back in the day.  This is a very sad state of events!!!  One of my two friends says that LA is very transient and that people come and go often here.  I agree...So I will probably be leaving town as well.  We shall see...  But why do I only have two friends left in LA you may ask!!?!?!  Both of which I knew before I got here???  I am not THAT weird, I know how to make friends...I promise...but I have decided that west coast people and east coast/southern people are very different.  To the point that I can actually lump east coast and southern people together because these usually different groups are one and the same when comparing to the west coast.  They ask the same questions...Why do these west coast people stay on the west coast and never leave?  Why are everyone's boobs also used for flotation devices?  Why are Uggs at all stylish when the weather doesn't drop below 70?  Why is the weather so eerily nice but the people aren't?  Why do people surf in the cold ass Pacific to almost get eaten by sharks?  okay, enough with the questions.  But seriously, I cannot seem to get on the same wavelength as the folks here- even at the most fun world of where I work.  Lest you think I am crazy, many of my friends who have left town and the ones (2) that are still here feel the same way.  It is an odd odd land of the west.  So, I figure I will go to NYC where they may be odd as well, but at least they are the east coast kind of odd.  That I can deal with.               "
"                 Did anyone see the Wedding show yesterday on ABC, I think???  For all my Wellesley friends, do y'all remember Christine(a?) Hrul???  I remember chrul from the message boards- anyway she was on this show because she randomly decided to marry her HLS boy in Prague in a castle.  And she showed some Bridezilla style that I am sure other Wellesley women will show in the future.  But I was very annoyed because they said she was from Wesleyan- but I think she went to grad school there or something...but you never know.  The Wellesley/Wesleyan mix-up may have lived on in tv land!   My past weekend was marred by a SERIOUS hang over from Friday's activities (the drinking tales continue!)-  I couldn't eat or drink until 9pm on Saturday.  That ain't right.  The night included almost getting thrown out of a bar, someone falling, and someone waking up with vomit on one side of the bed and themselves on the other side of the bed.  I won't tell who did what- but it was a rough night had by all!!!               "
"                 Well, the weekend held quite a few surprises for my friend, shermain from the sherm, and I. On Friday we went to see The Manchurian Candidate, a lovely little movie with Denzel in it. It was a good movie but there were some random/disturbing parts that came up throughout the film. One of which involves Denzel biting the crap out of someone, ala Mike Tyson. Despite that, and a few other crazy actions, Manchurian was pretty good!  Saturday night, after some vegetarian grub and a failed attempt at getting our palms read, we went to check out a party posted on a Yahoo online group called 'LA Fun'. Joining this online group was our attempt to connect with our west coast peeps. And connect we did....with one person...who has the same name as my ex which I promptly pushed out of my head to give him a fair chance. This party was supposed to be pretty big, but we only met this one guy- but he was a bit of a party himself- he ran around the bar trying to find other 'LA Fun Clubbers' and when he determined there were no more, he told us many, many stories. Stories that involved his friend punching his wife in the stomach and about his job as a satellite technician for the air force with an incomprehensible work schedule that boggled the mind...he entertained us for an hour and then we got free...only to have my ass grabbed while trying to get into shermain's car!!! Ahh Venice...what fun!!!  So, while we didn't get attacked by a serial killer or get punched in the stomach, it puts into question these online activities. Do you really find normal people through them??? The guy we met, I will call him by his Indonesian name, budi, was okay but odd. And what about online dating??? I have friends who have done this, but it hasn't turned out so well...short guys and uggers galore! Any online success stories?? Whether it be friends you meet or dates??                 "
"                 So I heard that The Village was extremely dissapointing- if anyone out there in Blog world has seen it, let me know.

"       For shear genius,  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  swings ellispse's around  The Da Vinci Code . The protagonists of Foucault's Pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the Knights Templar would believe anything...so they make up their own phenomenal history of man--complete with prophesies and death rituals. They soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers...and, of course, satanic death rituals.  For genius and plot  Foucault's Pendulum  stands heads above the Code, yet it suffers one fault: The book is long and tedious. I suspect if I really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories, I would find it all long and tedious as well. Three quarters of the way through the book, I was fed up with all the cultist idiocies, and just wanted the book to end. There's a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin...now get to the end....please.  It is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies. Even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas. They kidnap young girls, they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time. They read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride Trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies. (For those who are wondering. If you ride inbound Trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book. I was watching one of these creature one day. The creature was literally shaking as he read. He suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that I had ever witnessed. The creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found...ingraining them in his memory. I was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creature's enemies. The creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop.  There are times when I really question why I live in the place where I live. I like the mountains and deserts, but I really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation.  Back to fiction. In many ways, I agree with Orson Scott Card that Science Fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts. When accepted as fiction, the format really lets our minds explore different ideas. We can connect absurdities like Umberto Eco. The open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment. The method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists.  Fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks.  Yet there is also a strange point where cultism, theology, guruism and pure fiction collide. This is what I find troubling. We create a fiction, then people build on that fiction. They destroy that which does not fit in their world, etc..  I guess I should mention, when I was reading Foucault's Pendulum, I had a rather dull witted boss. He could not understand the ending of the book. Caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book, he could not understand why Umberto Eco ended the book THAT WAY!!!!  Could there have been any other way? The ending seemed obvious from the first page. There was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about.  In this regard, the plot of the Da Vinci thriller was better designed. We did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter. More of a thriller, the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled, all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people...while the ending of Foulcault's Pendulum comes off as a let down. Even worse, some of the 'normal people' suddenly seem like monsters.         "
"       I finally read the  urlLink Da Vinci Code . It was a fun fast paced read. It was much better than  Digital Fortress .   In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown put together a nice coherent plot, likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking. Apparently, people are eating the book up. It has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category.  Overall, I found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history.  I do have to admit. In many ways, I am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior (more rational and or more balanced) form of spirituality than christianity.   Yet, overall, I think the primary message of the book was on target. The book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history. Trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years.  The political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient Greeks. The destruction was similar to what we saw the Taliban doing in Afghanistan and we see the Islamic clerics doing in Iran. In order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons, there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought.  As for people destroying history for religious reasons, here in Utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful University that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the Maya, Aztecs and other native Americans to fit what is, most likely, a fictional account of the Americas.  To add an element of conflict to the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts...the conflict between man and women. The primary premise of the book is that the Vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female. The priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women.  The idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling. This is much like what Hegel was doing with his Philosophy of History. He had the world moving through these thesis/antithesis conflicts. Claiming to be a scientist, and claiming his conflicts were scientific, Hegel gave the world a very compelling history.  Having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device. I can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the Da Vinci Code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy.   As for real history. A few days ago I saw the tale end of an interview by Richard Rubenstein for a work called  Aristotle's Children . I placed an order for the book, and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep.  If we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society, I think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion. It seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic, the society rises. When the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo...it declines.         "

"       I just made my first electronic quarterly tax payment with the IRS EFTPS tax payment system; So, I saved a stamp, saved Cliff Clavin the effort of sorting and delivering mail, and saved the effort involved in having an office federal letter-opener-person open an envelope. &nbsp; Having done all that, I now need to make my complaint about how stupid it is that we pay taxes on estimated amounts.

In all&nbsp;likelihood sanity will&nbsp;prevail and I will&nbsp;keep having to work temp jobs for food. &nbsp; Personally, I think the best way to handle taxes would be to define a special tax account at a bank. Taxes would be assessed as money is withdrawn from the account. If the taxes were taxen out automatically as we did our day to day business, people could better manage their tax liabilities...rather than playing this silly estimating and tax return games that the IRS requires.

"       I've only seen bits and pieces of the hype surrounding the 9/11 Commission report. Everything I've seen has got my bogus meters flashing full.  The main gist of the 9/11 commissiont is that there was just too much of that freedom thing going down in the United States and now we a more powerful centralized police to protect the nation's interests. Yep, their&nbsp;conclusion seems to be to do unto the US what Al Quaida wished to do unto the US...curtail freedom.  The report claims that 9/11 was a failure of the imagination. Then they go on to report that the security experts&nbsp;are now&nbsp;imagining things much worse than 9/11 . The implication is that we are much greater danger because security experts are imagining more.   If anything, there is an reverse relation to what the security experts imagine and our overall safety. The fact that people are much more attentive has increased security.  Now, the fact that we are actively&nbsp;engaged in a war means that security risks are greater. What the experts are, or are not imagining does not dictate the extent to which the US enemies wish to do us harm. The experts' imaginations affect their attentiveness. It does not affect the sentiment of Al Quaida.  The big failure of the pre 9/11 world was not the lack of centralization of security forces, nor even the imaginations of security experts. It is the fact that the US and the western world had turned a blind eye to the oppressive regimes, overpopulation and disaffection of&nbsp;the Islamic world.  If the puppet governments in Iraq and Afghanistan simply turn into the corrupt nepotistic regimes that the US has installed in the past, then we have two new breeding grounds for anti American terrorists...just as the corrupt Saudi Arabia was the breeding ground for the 9/11 terrorists.  If we end up with states like those put in place by George Bush the first, then America is in deep trouble...between now and the next war, the technology gap is likely to lessen.          "

"       I caught the end of  urlLink le tour france  on cable. I have to admit that cycling is truly a beautiful event. Watching the waving motions of the peloton is truly hypnotic.  I've always seen cycling as a lone wolf sort of sport. It is a challenge against one's self. I enjoy being way out on an empty country road cycling by myself grooving with nature. I never really understood why there were teams, or why people bothered competing.  Quite frankly, in recent years, I've been extremely turned off by the Utah Mountain Cylcling scene ( urlLink iMoab.com ) which is into this extreme 'tear up the desert' free falls down the face of cliffs. Yes, mountain bikes can do as much damage to the wilderness as a jeep...or a stick of dynamite. I tend to limit my mountain biking to roads. Trail ride does too much damage to a trail. The mountain bike is the best way to experience canyonlands or the swell...but there's enough roads already in existence. I don't need to carve a new one with my fat tires.  Anyway, seeing, a well formed peleton is rejuvenating. I can now understand why cyclists go through all the hassles of the professional racing circuits to build up the skills ncessary to ride in such a formation. The race itself forms a work of art. If I were to try and ride in such a formation, I would twist the wrong way and knock everybody down. They other cyclists would get reall upset.         "
"       Oil prices hit historic highs. The stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result.  The one biggest fault that I find with the Bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil.  Conservation is not simply about having less...it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume. In this regard, I think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing people's attention on efficiency. For that matter, one of the first jobs I had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks. The rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed.  I also had temp jobs in construction. The firms I worked for were actively eying the cost of materials. When the cost of wood was high, they would employ people to salvage the wood. When it was low, the wood added to the landfills. Pulling nails from lumber is not the best job, but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose.  I think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low.  Anyway, hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil. Is is possible to shorten the commute? Or perhaps it is possible to own two cars: a economy car for every day travel, then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions?  Sadly, our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation. Oil prices are rising and Bush's circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever. Bush looks at the economy. His circle of friends is getting richer than ever before. Nothing wrong here!!!!!!!  As for my get rich quick schemes (I really should call these a get to minimum wage quick scheme), I've added a  urlLink Back to School  page and a  urlLink Earth Friendly  products page to the various web sites. In my attempts to put your money where my mouth is, it seems that what I should try to do with the sites is emphasize quality over quantity and sustainable living.          "
"       The income side of the equation is still too weak. I've been very good about lowering expectations, but the old income seems to be lowering itself even faster than the expectations.    Anyway, I end up wasting the first several days of each month brooding over the income question. Yuck! Anyway, I was thinking of concentrating the money making schems in the area of  urlLink personalized products . The area of custom engraving is a place where the internet can excel.  At least marketing takes up very little brain cells...it just eats up pride. Of course, none of the other little projects are going that well. I keep finding areas that I need to research before completing any of the other sites.         "

"                 Doli Incapax   and the 50-egg cake   I was at my friend  urlLink Joy's Blog   the other day, and read something interesting, called  doli incapax .  Basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility can't be held accountable for wrongful actions/ crime that they commit 'coz they can't yet tell right from wrong, and may not understand what they're doing.  Just what is the 'legal age of responsibility'? Hmm...maybe the argument can be used for certain *ahem* 22 year-olds?  I'd love to plead that case. Especially for me, the  bumbly butter-fingered buffoon .  Well, it was Shawn's 24th B'day party today, though his b'day's tomorrow (that's the surprise!), and I kept doing bumbly things. Like dropping Joy's camera (classic 3 stooges stuff), biting into my plastic fork, and worst, accidentally hitting E-Gene's still-recovering-from-ligament-operation knee. ARGF. After  I was so careful not to. (He was in pain - you should've seen his face.) Oh and did I forget to mention that I left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through it's own rubber insulated wiring? How one day can go so wrong I don't know...sigh...  And it's not just today. It's EVERYDAY. I'm constantly making a fool of myself, either putting my foot in my mouth or causing/being involved in accidents. Charles says I should just try to be more aware, but as you can see from the knee hitting incident, it makes no difference. I'm just bumbly lil' ol' me. Ah wells.....    Enough of my whinging and whining...   Shawn's party was pretty great, organised by his girlfriend Joy. We stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches, pasta and nachos. BURRRRP. And of course, later, the DENSEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. It must have had 50 over eggs in it (I'm extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of Peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it. I'm not kidding.) ACK...feeling the pain now...  I think the highlight of the party has to be the 'What do I hate/love about Shawn part' where everyone got to air their grievances. For more information, check out  urlLink his Blog  . Let's just say we had a ball of a time...hee hee hee...  Whatever it is, we all had a great time. Too bad Shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after. :-) Now THAT'S what I call a good party, when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration. (No lah, he's not that pathetic...he was only let in on it 'coz there was no way to get him out of the way. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! doodeedoodeedoo... His pasta was pretty good though.)     Bit of a borin' ol' read innit?     All rights, that's all for today. Sorry it's a bit of a boring read so far, only 'coz I'm too busy/lazy to write with my usual *ahem* creative flair.

He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm.  Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed 'seeing him off' to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm.   He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident...  Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page!     Just a quick update on my iBook situation.    Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook.  It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule!  Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had.  Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem.   (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?)  The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those 'dude' IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying 'no dramas' meaning 'no problem'. So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha...  Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up...           "
"             It hasn't been a good day.  Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!)  I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend.  Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH.  Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!!  I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!)   I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it.  Sigh...why don't I ever learn?           "
"                 AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHHGGGGHHHHHH        I dropped my iBook. My precious precious iBook. On the ground. From a chair. I knocked it over. By accident. Honest.    Ack! Now my Microsoft Word application won't open, and certain folders in the Finder can't be opened either.    And I have 3 MAJOR essays due soon.    HELP!! I'm almost in tears. This is terrible. And I really wanted to finish an essay by today so I could start on the rest. But I guess it's not meant to be. The scary thing is, I think I may have to send it into the Apple Store and get it fixed, and they might wanna change the hard drive or something. Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff.       WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW??      I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something.  Either that or I should just be less  lun-zun .   Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always  lun-zun  ;-)  Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents.   But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it.   Or Can You??    I don't know. I really don't know.   As a famous man once said,      So Help Me God!!               "

"             All rites...  Well then, things are starting to heat up for me now..lotsa essays and stuff. Feeling the pressure a bit..sigh. Not sure what to do. Plus i have to struggle with the various assignments, and i keep procrastinating.   I think that's (one of) my biggest faults...  Anyways, am eating butter and sugar on bread right now - the poor man's brekky hehe. But it really doesn't taste fantastic on sourdough bread. My advice is, stick to plain ol' white 'lo-ti'.  I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was  feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz...  Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait!  As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system. But I'm supposed to wake up early and go for Brekky at this place called Fruits of Passion. It's got really good brekky, but a lil' expensive. Ah wells...pancakes yay!  Nitey nite!

"               Bras 'n Things    Woohoo...went shopping again today. Myers is having a sale, today and tomorrow only, so i ended spending $88 on lingerie!! But i bought like 7 items, so that was pretty worth it (usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear...).  So yes, am pretty happy. Going crazy shopping i know. I spent 2 hrs there, SOLELY in the lingerie section, while poor Charles had to wander around the department store alone...poor guy.  But all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job. Eeeks..praying for a good and fun one.  Anyways, we had a nice night after all that shopping...came back to Homebush (my old apt. where Wally, E-Gene and Shawn still reside) and cooked dinner, then had our Monday TV night. Yay, nothing like good food and good company (friends and the telly heehee).  Tomorrow my friend Joanne's supposed to arrive from Canberra for a visit. That should be fun! I'm also supposed to watch 'I am Sam' tomorrow as well, can't wait.  By the way, everyone's vacating Homebush on July 7. Wally's moving to stay with a church friend, Shawn's moving to Jon's place (and therefore becoming my neighbour!), while E-Gene may or may not be returning to S'pore for good. I feel sad..it's like an end of an era or something. Had good times here, plus both Michelle's and Kenneth's places are in North Melbourne. Sigh...Wells, we're having a going away party on Thursday, have the whole gang over to bid this place a fond farewell.   Getting late, better sleep now.  Nites             "
"               It's been awhile...    Yep, i'm back to blogging again...it's been quiet, mostly 'coz i've been tied up with assignments n essays n stuff. But it's the hols now, at least till 29 July!  Been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th. Went skiing at Mt. Buller with E-Gene's family, and that was really fun. His whole family was there, including his sis and bro-in-law and nephew. Boy, the baby's cute! His name's Ethan, and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would, but sadly...need to find erm, some server or something b4 i can upload pics right? (Hmm... i think i can put it up on my mac site...will check that out.)  Anyways, skiing was really fun, had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe....would have loved to ski more, or at least try a longer distance, but it wouldn't have been much fun without E-Gene around...he couldn't ski 'coz he didn't want to risk injuring his knee again.  Watched the England-Brazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon (the telecast here was at 4.30pm). The crowd was a good mix of Brazilian and English fans, so there was an equal amount of cheering going on. We had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city, but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away. So we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead.   The match was pretty exciting. Let it be known, I'm not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer, but i do enjoy watching the game now and then, especially between good teams. But i think i still prefer watching it by myself, or with a smaller group of people. I guess when you don't share as much passion about the team as the VB-drinking bloke next to you, it's hard to cheer the team on (and in the process slosh beer on your clothes).   But there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too, watching the game, having chips and wedges and the occasional Lemon Ruski. They looked as out of place as I did, me with my calm claps, plastic smile, and feeling torn between rooting for England (which my friends were, and i'm 'supposed' to by default as E-Gene is a Liverpool fan...), and Brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills. Plus Brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after Owen's goal. (AND!! Ashley Cole wasn't too friendly to Ronaldinho who'd placed his hand on the former's shoulder as a friendly gesture, or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least, only to have Cole shove his arm away. Plus Cole was equally rude to other players later on.   erm, if anyone disagrees, drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette  Which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the Brazilian players after a while...)  Well, two Bacardi Breezers and many contraband hot peanuts (we bought some from the Asian grocer and snuck them in) later, Brazil's in the semi's for the World Cup. No surprises there i guess, although it would've been nice to see England in the semis after all this time...    Wow...i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh? Amazing...    Oh wells, anyways, it being the hols and all, i'm trying to find a job now. Either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something. Both seem pretty fun to me... :-) Less boring than an office job. But i need a good environment (pple and boss must be nice), good flexible hours (so i can still enjoy the hols, and spend time with my sis when she comes over), and good pay (not too worried about that, pay here is pretty decent, from $10-15 at least, depending on the job). So praying for opportunities...  All rights, almost 1am now, am planning to go to church tomorrow (after a looooong hiatus...bad huh?) so gotta go sleep! Nites!  Okies, it's late. Will write more (hopefully) tomorrow.  Drop me a flooble yah?           "

"               We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta.  The allergy symptom is described as a 'red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck.' The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe.   According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a 'walking asthmatic lobster with bumps', she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and 'wind' in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort.  Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment.  According to Miss Wong, 'My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried.'  After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night.  'I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it.'  After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week.  'I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?'  30 July 2002 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme...           "
"               Chest Pains Part Deaux     Why do I seem to always hurt the ones I love the most?  Why do I lash out?  Sometimes I just wish that they'd disappear. Even when I don't want them to. Or maybe I do.  Sometimes I just want to  yell  and  scream  and  shout  at people. To just fully release!  But I can't. I'm trapped. I worry about consequences and their feelings and remorse that I know I'll feel at the end.  I wish they wouldn't take it personally if I really did that. Even if it really is personal.  If I could have said something just now, I would have said :  Actually I don't know what I would have said.  My heart's beating way too fast for its own good now. It hurts. Can't breathe. Heartburn?

"               Today...   I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and I mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact.  Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all.  Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!!  There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing  - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here!  Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the 'concubine' you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the 'wife', the one he's married to, while Shawn's the 'mistress', the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever...  No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too. Miss his sudden rants about society's faults and the various places in Melbourne which are 'a bloody rip-off!!'  Welcome back Shawn.          "

"               Chaddy and Dandenongnongnenong   I had a truly wonderful time today. Woke up, went shopping in Chadstone Shopping Mall with my sis, and then drove to Mt. Dandenong where I had terrific devonshire scones, the hugest sundae you've ever seen, and lovely asparagus, chicken and cheese fingers, accompanied by Taylor's tea. Yummm....  Not by myself of course - with E-Gene, Tess and Charles.  Later, it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner, which unfortunately i cracked much later that night. (No fear, it's still usable - one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish).  Added to the depletion in my wallet's funds was the $$ spent on a nice new 3-for-the-price-of-2 book at Border's, which turned out to have a 20% discount for Uni students today. (Charles and EG returned at night to make more purchases).  And that was my day.   Tomorrow should be fun as well - prepping for a b'day party for my sis, who turns 19, and who'll be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today. It'll be a medium-small affair - about 10 pple for a potluck dinner. Little cocktail sausage  hors d'ouevers  anyone?  But tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day I'll see my sis for a really long while. She'll be in Bristol from September/October onwards, for the next 3 years. But she'll be back at least once a year, so that'll be good. Am planning to visit her in Bristol one day, so we can get a Euro Rail pass and travel round Europle. Excitement!  Having Tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow. In many ways we're so much alike, bumbling, making mistakes as we find our way through life, and it's hard when I realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when I do it too. Ack. Plus I also seem to nag a lot at her hehe...(which incidentally is very much the same way EG used to nag at me). As she puts it, I tend to treat her like a living doll, often mothering, (even smothering?) her. I guess 'coz I'm too used to being the older sis.  Am trying to let go I guess.   One thing's for sure though, I'm definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on Friday. I can imagine it now, me blubbering away at the airport. Eeek. Really for all the stuff that irritates me when she's here, like not having my own space, small quibbles about inane stuff, I really love having my sister around. Especially 'coz we both share the same warped sense of humour (we're the only 2 idiots who laugh at each other's half-assed jokes, which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people). Underneath certain differences, we   get   each other. Plus it's also cool when we can trick other people over the phone 'coz we both sound the same. Muahahahah....  Ah well, mushy eh? Ahhh, I can still recall the times when we'd fight and scratch and pull each other's hair. Woohooo...  Time to sleep.My bed awaits.           "
"               Conversations with my sis    Tess: Namu? Me: er..namu? Tess: Namunamunamu! Me: You have namu-itis... Tess (shock, horror): Namu is NOT a disease! It's a way of life!!   (Note to readers: I still have absolutely no idea what Namu is. A term purportedly invented by my sis, it still dares to do the unthinkable and defy definition. One up for the think-out-of-the-box-ers) .            "
"               Tess and Tas    In the last few weeks I can safely say I was never for a moment bored.  Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...)  School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting.  On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack....  Going to Chadstone ('the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere') and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character.  Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat  - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me.   I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage. Woah nelly...)  Not that I'm really a fan actually. I just watch it once in awhile when I happen to flip the channel. Demons and witches, pardon me for my lack of liberal-minded thinking, still pretty much freak me out. They might seem harmless on TV, with their wisecracks and all, but that's what the Devil wants you to think doesn't he? Hmmm...  Anyways, time to sleep. Wondering if I should bother to sign up for the Melbourne Blog Meetup or not. Hmm...    Ciao bella!              "
"               The Name Game    I like the name Aidan (Ay-dun). Guess it must be all that   Sex and the City   that I've been watching. I dunno. It just has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  I also like the name Arian, or Arienne, or whatever spelling permutations there are. Pronounced  Ari-ahn  . Or maybe   Ari-ann  .  Nice name for kids don't you think? I can imagine yelling at them to tell 'em dinner's ready. AHHH RIIIIII!!! or DANNY!! Sounds nice eh?  Although I also would like calling my kid by his/her initials too, which is why a middle name is needed. Like CJ or AJ or KC or something. hehe... i once thought of calling my daughter Caitlin Josephine just so i could shorten it to CJ.  E-Gene, sadly, thought naming his kid Aidan Samuel Soh would've been a laugh (yeah we both like the name Aidan. Whoever gets a boy first gets that name! dammit...tick tock tick tock...). Can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground? Who wants his kid's initals to be ASS??!! Wah lau eh...damn cruel...  Ah wells, who gets the male mind eh?         "
"               It's one of those days    It's one of those $&^$(*&^& days when you just hate everything and everyone and everything around you. Everything.  I don't understand why I'm so edgy. I just am.  And it's annoying that it just comes out in tight-lipped strained tones when I speak. I apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today.  I hate that i can't express myself properly, fully, and without whining. As one of my good friends Michelle says, 'Sarah and whining just go together, but we accept it i suppose. It's part of you.'  Sigh.  Sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hard-core sailor blush.           "
"               Drew drew a picture of drool...   Yeppers, this week is Drew Barrymore week. With highlights on TV Wed and Sat (Best Men and Home Fries), plus me n EG are watching Riding in Cars with Boys tonight. Yay...  My friend Elaine is flying off tomorrow morning to see her bf in San Fran. He's a sailor she met at the WTC in Singapore. Quite exciting really. I hope she takes lots of pictures!  Anyways, gtg watch RICWB now. Seeya!            "
"               Coffee, Tea or Me?    Thaaaaaaat's right. I'm becomin' a *ahem* barista, or in more colloquail terms,  ka-fei mei . Yep, just applied at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf round the corner from my place, and hopefully will get a job there, serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes. Yay...can't wait.  No seriously. I can't wait. Need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping, eating and taking public transport. You'd be amazed at how much I spend a week. Not to mention groceries, rent and phone bills.  But being a  ka-fei mei  isn't too bad an idea. I don't really mind it actually, mostly 'coz the hours are flexible, you get to interact with people and you aren't stuck behind a desk and computer. It's fun actually, which is why I'm pretty excited about it, IF I get the job.  The funny thing about Melbourne is, to get any job, you've gotta have a resume. EVEN for part-time work at coffee joints. Strange huh? Back home they just make you fill up a form, and if you look pleasant enough, speak good english, and can tell the difference between a mocha ice-blended and a mocha caramel ice-blended (it's the caramel,  duuhhh ), you're a shoo-in for the job.  Here, they get you to fill in a form, and a resume with REFERENCES mind you, people they can call to vouch for you, just in case you're a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot Special Dutch Chocolate. Can you just imagine that?  Sttstttsttt....must get foam just right, stttststttt, just right, caramel mocha, mocha...waitaminit. Did she just give me FIVE CENTS LESS?   Hey lady, you're five cents SHORT. It's four ninety-FIVE lady, FIVER at the end lady, heard that? Says so on the screen! FIVE CENTS LADY! FIVE CENTS GEDDIT? FIIIIIVVVEEE CENTS!! FIIIIIVVVVVEE WHOLE CENTS!!!! What, you don't know how to count huh? AHHHHHHHHH!!!   and I suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers, screaming like a banshee, spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere, a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple.   Phew!    Erm, in case my future employers are somehow reading this, I'm NOT REALLY INSANE. I've NEVER been institutionalised at a mental hospital before (unless you count my secondary school years...)   Thank you. Just needed to clear that up.  Well, the job's all in God's hands. Praying for it, and going by faith. I really want a job that has a good working environment, good colleagues and boss, good flexible hours, and good pay (it's pretty standard pay here - The Bean'll prob. pay me about $10-12 an hour, a rate I'll never get back in S'pore!). Hours-wise, i wrote on my application form that i'd prefer the morning 7am-12pm slots Tues to Fridays (although negotiable), simply 'coz that frees up the rest of the day, and my sis is coming to visit. And i don't really have to wake up that early 'coz i live pretty near. So praying! They'll probably call me soon to arrange an interview. I'll sell the fact that I can spell most people's names, an asset when writing them down on the plastic ice-blended cups. (can you imagine? The Bean at Junction 8 Bishan spelt my name as Sey-la! Wah lau eh....)  Okies. gtg now. Nite nite.  Drop me a flooble yah?           "
"                Daisies and Daffodils     Oh yesterday was wonderful. Helped out with Daffodil Day, which is basically a day the Cancer Council of Victoria has to raise funds for Cancer Research.  It was really fun - woke up at 6 plus am (can u believe it??!! And I'm NOT a morning person...), went down to Flinder's St. Station and sold all sorts of Daffodil-type merchandise, including pins, ribbons, pens, a cute teddy bear (which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws), a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils! I got to wear this Daffodil Day t-shirt, which I even managed to keep (though I really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in, but couldn't. Shucks....)  So there we were, a bunch of girls at a table outside the station, selling stuff. 3 of us decided to wander down a lil' further, outside Maccers on Swanston St., and managed to sell quite a bit too. We even got our picture taken by this passing photog.  All in all, a really fun start for yesterday. I'd definitely do it again, esp. since it was for a good cause (or as Ew Lee puts it, 'buy a daffodil, support a chawitab...a chawribaba...a cha.. ah-fegget-it, it's for Cancer Research!!') and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause. Best of all,   hello , yellow is   so  my  colour !           "
"               The Big Issue   I saw him at Flinder's Street Station today. Got off the tram and bought a copy.  At least I think it was him. He sounded different. Maybe he was just another gruff old man.  I hope it was him.            "
"               ARGH 2    ARGHHHHHHH. No TIME to look for one either...           "
"               ARGH    ARGHHHHHH. No job......           "
"               Why?   I don't have a regular job any longer. They told me yesterday, after my shift, that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something, and would call me as and when they needed me. So now it's a casual basis kinda thing. They were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen, and I was still under shock so I didn't press for details. I figured maybe 'coz they had 2 new pple, this Shanghainese woman and man, who seemed like new partners or soemthing. Ah dunno lah.  I honestly think it's a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely, YET keeping them hanging on your lil' pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone.  This REALLY sucks. I mean, what the? After 2 weeks of training etc. And I really think I did pretty ok, and got along with everyone. If it was just a trial, tell me it was a trial. I shifted my classes around so I could fit the job in. Now they do this. I have a bleedin' 4 hour break on Wednesdays for goodness sake!  I'd better cancel the scheduled transfer that's supposed to move $$ every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one. Was planning to put aside $$ each week, earn interest, and have $$ at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols. Now  that  idea's shot.  Happened to my friend, who was working the Mon & Thurs shift too.  This really stinks.  On the upside, at least I'm using the time to get some research done. ONLY 4 weeks left. Haven't done much. Arrrghhhhh.  Stomach hurts now. Gastric and wind. Am not daring to try Mylanta again. Tried 3 other forms of medication though, to no effect. Sigh.  Only looking forward to the presentation for TV Cultures we've been working at. We're gonna majorly impress the pple, and whoop everyone's ass! As Michalengelo (of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) would say,   Cowabunga Duuude!                "
"               Regret   Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it  never really quite comes round again?  Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges.  He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?' said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head.  'You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. 'Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs,' he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. 'No,' he replied simply.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me.  He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend.  I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette.  The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one.   I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed.   19 August 2002             "
"               It's been awhile...    Yep, sorry haven't been on for awhile, mostly coz v.v. bz with school and all. Subjects this sem are  TV Cultures  (expert on this!!),  MarComm  (although unlike the one i took in Mass Comm...more theoretical),  Italian National Cinema   (must read up on fascism etc etc..), and   Contemporary Hollywood Cinema   (can someone PLEASE explain '2001: A Space Odyssey' to me please??!!)  Special Mention Alert: Welcome PRIYANCA!! Yes, this is my blog....however, if you are reading this right now,   get back to work!!  . Tsk tsk... I wonder what AWARE would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading people's blogs instead of doing her job... tsktsk...hehehe  Am v.v. tired nowadays, mostly 'coz of the early starts. Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow!  The  job so far is pretty cool.  Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-)   I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits.   Phew   I hoped all that made sense.  Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated   daily  , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-)  Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon...  1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices  2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh  3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek...   Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows   that   for revenge??!! Creeeppy...'come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!' eeeek.....   4. Start on essay research, which eek, are ALL due in FIVE weeks time! (one of the classes is TV Cultures, and have been doing   tonnes   of research for it - heheh watching the tube that is....)  5. Finally change the 'Shpiel of the Week'  And now off to bed. I hate early classes. zzzzz  Drop me a flooble or  urlLink SIGN MY GUESTBOOK!!               "
"               A new dawn awaits   All right! I have a new job up, and it's starting tomorrow! Excitment - it's just a simple cafe job, and I'm not sure what my duties exactly are, but it's in school and it's income so I'll try my best. Really need favour in the manager's eyes!  Phew, getting this job was such an ordeal, mostly becasue I've never received any replies to the resumes I sent out over the hols. But maybe it's good 'coz mebbe God wanted me to hold out for this, esp. since in school, and I got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing me-stuff, and hang out with my sis.  Well, the cafe is run by these Shanghainese. I have no either what posessed me to do so, but I spoke to them in Mandarin! Argh, my half-past six broken Chinese. Eek.  It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too.  The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form:    Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing?   (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?)  To which he replied: Oh,   Jah-mes    Teeheeheee...yeppers,  Jahmes  teeheeeheee  He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11  a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at   such  an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went:    Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma?   (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?)    Ahh..shi shi!   (Yes, yes!)    Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de.   (I'm calling from XXX cafe.)    Oh dui dui dui!   (Oh yes yes yes!)    Oh dui dui dui.  (Was he making fun of me??)  Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma?   (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?)    Oh hai mei you.   (Oh not yet.)  Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh.  Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said,     Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question)   I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head.    Hah??   (Hah??)    Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?)    Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language.   (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.)    Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba.   (You can speak in English then.)    Oh hao, hao.    (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness)    Xia ge xing qi jian.   (I'll see you next week then.)    Ah, dui.   (Ah, yes.)  E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: 'Man, your Chinese really sucks!'  Sigh.           "

For your compassionate concern and calling me all the way from Singapore after reading my Blog and finding out about my short hospital trip, worrying when I didn't answer the phone the first time, and for also reassuring my sister that I was all right (who incidentally didn't even KNOW what had happened 'coz she hadn't been reading my blog - so much for keeping tabs on me), I dub thee my GREAT BUDDY!

Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of this year's Physical Protection Award 3 years in a roll is E-Gene Soh of Southbank!  [crowd cheers and screams]  For dropping everything and rushing me to the hospital at 2 am in the morning, and staying by my side as the anti-allergy medication took effect and I dropped off to sleep, and then getting up again later that morning at 7 am to fetch me home from the hospital, I dub thee my KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR!  [wolf whistles and a standing ovation ensues]  An Honorable Mention also goes to Jonathan Chew of Southbank for allowing me to use up his download credits on the last day of July. Thank you for ensuring that my Mac is now fully equipped with the latest software applications (and also for that really nice salmon lunch.)

"               JM is playing   Just found out that John Mayer is playing at the HiFi Bar at Swanston Street on 29th October! That's exactly one month from today!! Woopeedoo! Will definitely go check it out man...yay!!           "
"               That Purple Vegetable    Music: Am listening to  urlLink  John Mayer's  Room for Squares   . VERY VERY nice!! I highly recommend it for your (easy) listening pleasure...   Here's another Silly Song with Sarah!!    The Brinjal Song (aka An Ode to E-Gene)    You're a Purple Brinjal You like to dance and sing When you shake your brinjal butt It makes a sound that goes ding ding   Ok ok I know, why is EG a brinjal? Just thought he looks like one lah. Btw, do you know the other names for Brinjal are Aubergine and Eggplant? Teeheehee...that said, I don't really like eating it, unless it's the Lasagne-version that Wally taught me to make....very very yummy!   Brinjal-Lasagne Recipe   1. Fry brinjal till translucent (like how you would an onion I guess) 2. On baking tray lined with baking paper, place a layer of fried brinjal 3. Pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4. Repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5. Top off with a sprinkling of cheese (parmesan, mozzie, tasty, chedder, swiss, whatever you like) 6. Bake in oven till cheese has melted (I usually put it at a really high temperature so I don't have to wait too long...but that means you gotta watch it so it doesn't burn)  Voila! Yummy brinjal-lasagne!             "
"              What a day...  I spent a very enjoyable weekend so far. Friday was spent at the DFO near Moorabin airport, with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy...got a pair of Just Jeans for $39.95, and EG bought me a pair of slippers for $12. And I got sidetracked by a $12.95 top which I was totally indecisive about, and I didn't buy in the end...was too conscious that I'd eventually decide it wasn't flattering after I bought it and wouldn't wear it in the end...eep...  Yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends, a bunch I got closer to through the Alpha course we take in church. We had Yum Cha, then watched The Bourne Identity (featuring many out-of-focus shots), then watched a lil' footy (it was the Grand Final after all - the Brisbane Lions beat the Collingwood Magpies 75-66) on the big screen at Crown Casino while our friends played a lil' rapid roulette hehe...  I think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around, playing cards and a lil Twister. All in all, a very enjoyable day spent with them. I know how I've totally not really felt comfortable at ACCF, primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with, mostly 'coz they were  Aussie-Asian so there was a huge difference when we talked, even for simple slang terms and the wavelength. But this bunch is pretty cool - mostly Malaysians, but still got the   lors   and the  lahs  hehe... It's a great funny bunch of people - funny as in we laugh a lot.  Last night me EG and Shawn (and Evie for a lil' while) played Upwords...imagine the ingenuity that is involved when you really can't build any more words...we came up with stuff like 'Quita' (for quitter, said 'hood-style), 'Sista', 'Gemz', and we allowed Shawn's 'Fie' 'coz it's Ye Olde English...hehe. I really like playing board games with people, it's fun. I remember how every birthday and Christmas 'til I was 12, I'd get my parents to bring me to Toys R Us so I could get boardgames. I had Payday, Monopoly, Go for Broke, The Game of Life, Taboo (bought it on my 12th Christmas, and am still playing the game 10 years on, even though the set is a different one 'coz I lost the old one) and lots more. I loved, and still do love, boardgames...  My new obsession right now is crosswords puzzles, which I do with EG or whoever is available to hazard a guess at a seven-letter word for 'practiced boxing' (answer below*). That said, I'm stumped at an eight-letter word for 'announces'. The 6th letter is an R though...anybody can help? Please post a flooble or a bl00p if you have any clues....thanks!!     * The answer is 'Sparred'           "
"              Jazz and the Charleston  Oooh..went to watch  urlLink The Cat's Meow   starring Kirsten Dunst, Cary Elwes and also Edward Hermann, Rory's grandad in Gilmore Girls, who plays William Randolph Hearst, the 1920s newspaper titan. Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann).  The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh...  Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.  Am plannign to watch Lilo n Stitch later, prob at Highpoint. Some lighthearted 'toon eh to jazz up the week. Man, I've really been watching lotsa movies these couple of days...prob to make up for the months of abstinence hehe.  okies, cheerio. And please remember, flooble's down, so leave a bl00p (comment lah)!             "
"               Yueah Babay...   I have returned from watching Goldmember. Hmmm...dunno why, didn't laugh as much as I thought I would...maybe my expectations were a little high? I know, I know...how do u have high expectations when u watch Austin Powers right? But no, I actually like watching shall we say, *Doctor Evil-style finger quotes* 'stupid'  movies...like American Pie, Road Trip (although Tom Green was *trey* gross) and the list goes on...  Overall, i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the West-Side Story song n dance sequence... pretty nifty legwork I would say. Beyonce Knowles had great abs, bland acting - no sparkles there.   The highlight was doing the typical Singaporean thing after the movie - supper! Except it was more like dinner 'coz we hadn't eaten. We took our first trip to Bismi! A regular Prata shop, in Melbourne! With yummy prata and teh tarik, and it was pretty cheap too...full meal (2 pratas n tarik) for only $4.90. Yummers...  Oy...so full now... edge of puking.  My sis is leaving for Bristol tomorrow night. Just reading her blog makes me sad in away, like she'll be so much further away - it's not just a 2-3hr time difference anymore (depending on daylight savings), but much much more - the other end of the world! I will really miss her.   Somehow I feel and wish I could be a better sis n I dunno...be able to give her greater emotional support. I think I'm prob. one of those 'church'-type people who she referred to in her blog, who don't really know what to say and give tried-n-true advise, 'coz I probably don't understand the emotional turmoils she goes through. I'm less angsty I guess. The 2 of us are quite different in many ways, even since we were young. She tended to rebel and question the system, and still does (which i'm very proud of actually, she doesn't just accept things 'as they are', unlike me), while I just happily went about my way... sure we'd fight all the time thought - hated each other when we were kids, and I really thought she was a pest when I was in secondary school  - i remember once, when i went back to get my 'O'-level results, n she popped by to find out how i did (she was in Sec 1 then), and I was like 'Why you come?...aiyah just go back to your class lah'. I guess I really hurt her then. And even when she started hanging round my friends, like the Old Awake friends, and the Tsunamit people - i guess i didn't like her infringing on my 'territory'.  Irony is, she's prob closer to them now than I ever was... :-)  I think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic. On a trip to China, she stood at the front of the bus, in her little white jumpsuit and rainbow-coloured checked shirt, and sang into the mike connected to the bus' audioo system, while everyone clapped and cheered along. Wah lau eh - attention seeker! haha...But there was a really sweet side to her too. We had had a fight, or a brawl should i say, what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc. I think i hit her too hard, and she started crying and ran to my mum, who took the cane out. I ran to the corner, and was really prepared for a whacking man, 'coz she really looked pissed. And then my sis ran in front of me, spread her hands out, and said 'No! Don't beat   jie jie !!' So sweet right? In my head I was thinking 'Wah lau eh, trying to act again! Watch too much Channel 8 serials ....' but at the same time still relieved coz my mum's face softened....haha :-) Oh the stories of childhood.  To Tess, if you're reading this b4 your flight tomorrow. Take care, God bless, and you'll do fine in Bristol. I love you very very much.  Goodnight.           "

EEk..the last leg of my essay mash..trying to read all the stuff on domesticity for TV Cultures essay, except I did EXACTLY what the readings said lotsa pple so with TV..watch it in the background.   How intertextual/postmodern is that? A reading of me reading my readings while participating in the reading of televisual forms. Burp.  Ever tried speed reading? I did what I was taught eons ago in secondary school - place a finger in the middle of the sentence, and try to read the whole thing without moving yr eyeballs. Theory is to encapsulate the sentence at a glance, letting your mind fill in gaps in the sentence (ie pick out key words). IT'S NOT POSSIBLE without incurring any serious injury. Verdict: V.V. painful, only try if you're already   pah ciao    I saw my TV Culture's lecturer at the gelati place just now - what a coinkidink (sarah-speak for 'coincidence'). Don't think he recognised me though. Which was just as well...  Sleep now....             "

"               Feminista   I've recently come across this website, called  urlLink Big Bad Chinese Mama  . It's a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to, as the manifesto says, catch men in the act (of porn-ing).  I sent the website's url round to a couple of close friends, little knowing the stir it caused. But it was a really good stir, as in we started debating about the site's effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression, whether it's too controversial and nihilistic with the male-bashing and all.  This was what I wrote:   In my humble opinion, I figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today. However much we can argue about gender equality, about our roles in society, about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony, she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today. (I've personally used the same approach, albiet in a less confrontational way, to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year - yes yes, boast boast teeheehee)  It's a pretty in-your-face, confrontational gesture i suppose. What I think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking, through parody. Yeah, we're pretty much living in a post-everything world, post-feminist, post-modern yadayada. The fight has been fought, the battle has been somewhat won, but the war for equality still goes on (wow, how prosaic...). Like Velle said, the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide; i think it's all down to the whole personal-as-political approach again - i.e. if you feel that women and men play diff roles, so be it. If you feel we should use whatever power we have (sexual or otherwise) to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within , so be it.  Personally, I'm more of the humour-works-to-deconstruct kinda thing. Mostly 'coz (a) my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image (yes i can hear the coughs in the background! i know who you are!!), and (b) i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn, i'm proud of it!  Also, i think the fact that we're debating and thinking about it (the website as well as feminism at large) legitimises the topic anyways - yay! one up for the womyn!!   Another point I want to make is also this:  The fact is, that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism, or taking up the cause or whatever. When we discuss women's issues casually,  (even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem), and I say that i'm a feminist, it's always greeted with a blank stare and 'oh, so what do you do?'. Everyone equates feminism with activism and the bra-burning butch stereotype. I think feminism today is more subversive, and with the use of new technology (unfortunately a world equated with the techno-geeks-are-usually-men idea), that's what bigbadchinesemama.com aimed to do.  I mean I told my friend I use to clean my boyfriend's bathroom for him, and she said 'oh, you're definitely not a feminist that way'. I had to explain, firstly I liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way (must be all the fumes i've been inhaling from the Jif bottle), and secondly he wasn't free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agent's inspection, and thirdly it's nice to do something for someone, man or woman. If she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her, I would have (if and only if it wasn't in too deplorable a shape!!!).  Sigh...the defences we have to keep coming up with...

"               Alpha and Omega   I just returned from Alpha camp over the weekend, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. It was pretty far from Melbie though, in Upper Plenty, so far it was hardly on the Melway map. Eep. But the place was so fantastic! The  dorm rooms, the toilet, all really neat and clean, esp. the bathroom. All the amenities you needed, great food plus A REAL FIREPLACE. What more could you ask for!?!!  We spent the 2D/2N there enjoying each other's company, and learning more about the Holy Spirit - part of the Alpha course I'm taking at church, sorta like a foundation back-to-basics of Christianity kind a thing. Real good stuff.  EG had a great time too. Probably 'coz there was some serious male bonding going on. Him and a bunch of other like-minded noisy guys, sitting around after lunch, talking about cars n stuff. SO blokey...I made my friend Alan promise never to turn into them, guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe. He said no guarantees there. Sigh. What happened to all the Sensitive New Age Guys?   One highlight was learning Mafia, this really interesting game where someone gets 'killed' and you gotta find out who did it. Think Murderer meets Bluff meets Survivor and you get the gist. 3 Mafiosi, 1 Doctor, 1 Spy, and the rest are Civilians (9 people in all, plus 1 Game-master). You should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out. VERY layered game, and you never know who's bluffing. Very fun, and also very interesting 'coz you've got this group of Christians who are essentially lying to each other...hmmm....hehe  Anyways, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely do it again if I had the chance. Right now, slogging n trying to keep up with the essay schedule. Cheerios           "

"               It All Makes Sense Now!!    As you all know, I've been writing Silly Songs (aptly named Silly Songs with Sarah) for awhile now. To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head')   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive')   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J. Kitchen!! So now this ditty I came up with a YEAR ago, FINALLY makes sense!   *Ahem*   Kill Kenny Chicken....But don't kill the Kitchen.... (repeat)   Please don't ask me who Kenny Chicken is. I have no idea. Just some figment of my subconcious I suppose. BUT! Now we DO know how kitchens can be killed - when they're human!! Heeheeheeteeheehee... (Previously,  'don't kill the kitchen' came with a 'with germs lah!' reply to people's perplexed expressions.)  There of course have been times when these ditties have come back to bite me on the ass, unintentionally of course (no malicious content, and all G-rated songs ok?!). I recorded one as my voice-mail message, and left it there for quite awhile. Thing is, a potential employer for this job I really wanted to try out for after I graduated, but which I thought wouldn't come through 'coz he hadn't called for months since I put the application in, finally gave me a tinkle on the phone! And I didn't hear the phone. So it got redirected. And he heard the song. And this was the message he left:  'Er, wow...that's er real interesting er....anyways, this is Colin Gomez from Perfect 10....just wondering blah blah...'  ARGHFFF!!   5 September 2002           "

"              The Day When Many Things Happened  Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start...   12 pm   Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick.  So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, 'That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger'. Was it Arnie? I don't remember.  So I decide to just pick one of the topics,  Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English.  Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God.   1.30 pm  Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said 'Anonymous', so it was from a private number. 'Hello? Is this Sarah?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?'  In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me.   3.15 pm  Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class!   3.25 pm  Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works.   3.55 pm  Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub.  Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures.   4.00 pm  Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny.   8.00 pm  Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!!   8.30 pm  Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, 'Two's Company' (at least that's what I think the title is).   9.45 pm   JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!!  It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too  - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night.  Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into  'John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version'.  Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so  ngim-jim  over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica?  Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. 'How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?' 'No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?' 'Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?'  Hehe.  Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee!  Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission  - apparently the GA ones are sold out. BOOHOOOOOO).   11.50 pm  Walked out of HiFi Bar.   2.26 am  Just finished this Blog entry. Going to sleep now. Nitey nite, I've an interview in the morning.  29 October 2002            "

As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing.  On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite  bibik  in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time.  Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications.  On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it!  Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe.   Tata  Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out   urlLink this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless.           "
"               Bel's B'day  I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-)  Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like  Or Jian  (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert.  The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha.  Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends!  Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea...  Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too.   But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain.  I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe            "
"               My Mobile Phone...Literally (Part 2)   I walked slowly towards the tram stop... all the while feeling sad, and praying. 'Oh Lord...help!'  Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. Waitaminit! Wait a minute! Before I left the lecture hall, I threw a plastic bag into the bin. Now it had made an unusually loud 'thunk' when it landed, which was why I picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin. But I didn't see anything, so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when I threw the plastic bag in.  That 'thunk' could've been my phone! As I recall, I was holding my phone in my right hand - I must have let it go along with the plastic bag!  Excitement bubbled up inside me. I ran for the security station again, praying in tongues all the while. Panting and out of breath, I knocked on the window. 'Angelo! I..gasp..think...gasp...it could be in..gasp...hold on, I'm gasping too much...'  I explained my theory, and he just laughed good-naturedly. 'Sarah! You're killing us!' He called Keith again, and I ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre.  We walked back in anticipation, as I apologised to Keith for making him walk back there again. I was telling God, 'if I can find it, I'm just gonna say 'Thank You Jesus!' and use this as testimony man! I was so sure...   We reached the theatre, and I ran for the bin. Pushing my sleeves up, I dug into the bin, which housed a few coffee cups, my KFC plastic bag, and used tissues. No phone.  But I knew I heard a 'thunk'! So I shifted the bin aside, and lo-and-behold, it was there!! Neatly resting against the wall, undamaged.  WOOPADEEDOOO PRAISE GOD!!  I jumped up and down in excitement, and even grabbed Keith's arm, shouting 'Thank You, thank you!' He smiled, and said, 'That's ok, as long as you don't make me come back here again!' I grinned back.  We walked out, and I kept thanking God. I suddenly remembered that I had promised to proclaim Jesus' name in this situation, and I'd forgotten to. Suddenly I felt nervous about it saying it out loud. I whispered loudly 'Thank you Jesus.' - don't know if Keith heard.  I realised I was being a chicken about it, so as we were walking I said, 'Wow, that's amazing, I really thought I'd lost my phone!' Keith turned and nodded. 'Yeah, it's really a MIRACLE that I found it, I mean, most people never find their phones! I really THANK GOD man. It's just so amazing. AMEN, amen!', I said, stressing on the erm...Christian-sounding words...  As we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark, I looked up at the sky, and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me. The trees, the damp ground, the cold air. I raised my hands a lil', and whispered 'Thank You Lord.'     EPILOGUE  I walked back towards the guard station with Keith. Before he left, I said thank you agian, and asked for his name, giving him mine as well - just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus. I walked up towards the guard window and waved at Angelo through the glass, holding my phone up for him to see. He smiled. (Praise God btw, that the bunch of us were the last few to leave - that way I knew who was locking up, and so could locate Angelo at the guard station.)  I boarded the tram, and thanked God once again for his blessings. I bumped into another friend on the tram, and shared my testimony with her .  Our God's really an awesome God!              "
"               My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?'  'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...'  'Have you checked it?'  'No, not yet. Probably later.'  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.'  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed'  DUH, I knew that already.  'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!'  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.'  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!'  'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...'  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally              "
"               Why?    Why is it   that you can never repeat that fresh-from-salon look, even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair?  My hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky. I don't know how the guy at the salon did it, with his creme and his scrunching fingers, but it looks weird now....sigh. Or maybe 'coz I'm trying to do it with bed-hair, and not freshly blown & washed hair. Whatever it is, I can't repeat the look. Sigh...sob.    Why is it  that even though your body is aching and tired, your mind is still awake so you just can't fall asleep?  I spent the other night in an insomniac stage, and ended up watching informercials. I am actually seriously considering buying one of the products, Winsor Pilates from the website! Hmmm...    Why is it  that even though I have things to do, like essays and such, I can never fully concentrate on them?  Instead I end up getting distracted by TV and the like. Oh there's the computer, oh, maybe I'm hungry...hmmm maybe I should go mend the hole in my t-shirt...    Why is it  that even though I have school later, and I haven't done my readings, and my stomach's rumbling 'coz I haven't had lunch, I'm still stuck here blogging, drawn like a moth to a flame?

"               Highlights of the Day    I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point.   After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from 'wicked!' and 'gorgeous!' to 'don't go back to long hair in a hurry!' and 'eh, quite nice ah, hor?'  Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws?  Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked 'unreal' heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape.  The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY!  And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo!   Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round...  After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud.  Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!           "
"               Yummers   Had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt ice-cream. It's sitting in the freezer now, setting, and by tomorrow I should have a delightful dessert! Woopadeedoo!  That said, tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work, 'coz I've an essay due on Monday. It's the Cont. Hollywood one, which I caught a lucky break - i.e turned out I had 2 extra weeks to do it. Eep. But have I spent the time wisely doing more research? No....Why? 'Coz I deserve a rest dammit! teeheehee...  Oh yes, went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans. One was the Just Jeans one which I bought on Friday, the other a Sportsgirl one which I've been wearing a lil'  sua-ku-ly , i.e. with the hem folded up a huge chunk.   Did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day? I didn't! Thought I'd had to wait a couple of days 'coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do. Well, as I found out, JJ has an in-house seamstress who does it on the spot. Unfortunately, she wasn't in today, so I left it to be collected tomorrow.  As for the Sportsgirl one, they send it out to be altered, to a place just across the road called Melbourne Central Tailoring. It was on the 1st Level of an office building, in a tiny little room at the corner. I almost thought I was on the wrong floor 'coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitor's office, with its tinted glass windows and couches. It was only after hearing voices from my left, and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that I found the place, run by this really nice n friendly couple. The lady was talking to a Jeans West salesgirl (I figured JW also sent their jeans to be altered there...she was holding a couple of bags), so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile. Real nice. And the price was right too! After calling several places earlier in the morning, I found out they were the cheapest, charging only $10 (yes, yes, please don't compare to Far East prices ok? If I were back home, I'd have gotten my grandma to do it for me for FREE - she was a seamstress after all). I'd have sent the Just Jeans pair to them too, except for the fact that JJ charges only $5.50 to do their own jeans, with a receipt of purchase of course.  All in all, am quite excited to collect them tomorrow. Yippee-kai-yay!           "
"              Beautiful Collision  She was shy, and looked a little uncomfortable to be on stage for all to see. But her voice was beautiful, enchanting, ephemeral even, as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air, like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness. She was funny too.  'Is someone smoking pot in here?'  'Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes  (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well.'   The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit.  After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album 'Drive'), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are 'last song' performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore.  Confession: I teared when she sang 'Drive' as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose. Sigh, whadda wuss I am...  I think I might end up liking her first album more - will go take a listen and see if I'm right.

"               Lock 'n Loll...   urlLink  Killing Heidi   ROCKED man! The gig was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed (KH came on at 11.55pm!!).  There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going 'Wooohooo!!'. A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you. Two (banging) heads are a whole lot better than one!  Whatever it is, I highly recommend doing this. It's therapeutic. Let's lock 'n loll duuuuuuuudes!!              "

"              Nice...  Had a nice day today, hanging out with Charles watching The Banger Sisters, and then having dinner and a date with EG.   I was bugging him after dinner to 'be spontaneous' and to 'go somewhere', like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time.   Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching.  In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo?  *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....)  Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat's right...              "
"              Music makes the people come together...  How would I describe by taste in music?  I say, eclectic. Or in other words,  rojak .  I never really listened to music, other than Christian Praise n Worship growing up, since I was living with parents who thought 'rock music is not edifying to your soul. Why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good?' Not quite 'rock music is from the devil', though pretty close. But it does make a lotta sense in retrospect I guess.  After discovering that there was alternative Christian music (ie. same genres like rock, dance etc. but with Christian or more sanitised language), I was into that for awhile. Esp. since Jars of Clay was pretty cool.  Then it was Bossa Nova, and all that Jazz.  Now? I dunno. I listen to anything and everything. A bit of Killing Heidi, a little Diana Krall, some Foo Fighters, some John Mayer, a twist of Disco Montego, a dash of Bebel Gilberto and Jobim, some Cafe del Mar series.   Like I said, it's pretty rojak. After a long time trying to figure out my music tastes, I realised I can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as I can in a mosh-pit (like this Sat. at the KH gig - phew, gonna get me some bruises). Woohooo! I shall not be typecast! I am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music! hur hur...  Most underrated band? A New Zealand outfit called  urlLink  Eight  , who came down to S'pore a couple years back. I met the guys, and they were really really nice, and funny too (although a couple of the ones I knew have left since). Their music's really different, so if you get a chance to check 'em out, it'll be great. I personally can't really describe the music, or put it in any category. I call it weird-but-definitely-listenable. They call it rock.   And they're playing for Big Day Out in New Zealand next Jan too! kewl huh? Darn, too bad not in Oz, although NZ is a hop skip and jump away...hmmm...holiday?   PS. Happy Birthday Kenneth!!   21 November 2002             "

"              Training  It went really well, and the time just flew past. 3 hrs taken up in a whirl of coffee making and pounding. And there's more tomorrow. I can honestly say I'm really enjoying myself. It's was really fun, and not too stressful, 'coz the Queensberry n Lt. Bourke store isn't as bz as the rest of the GJs outlets in town.  In other news, my silly iron has broken down. Maybe the fact I'd dropped it accidentally from the ironing board has something to do with it. Maybe, just maybe. Whatever it is, it's gonna be hell to fix. Erp.  My cough and slight flu is still going on. All the honey drinks and gargling with Listerine doesn't seem to help. Dangnabbit!            "
"              This post was brought to you by the letters B, H and G, and by the number 33  Arghf. It was a high of 33 degrees celsius today. I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one!  It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh.  So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening  - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before. I can only describe the feeling in one word: bleuuurghghhffffgg. I felt extremely bleuuurghghhffffgg.   And the next coupla days promise to be worse. It's rollercoasting up and down, from 23 tomorrow, to 33 the day after, to 19 the day after that, to 23 on Thursday again. Wah lau eh.... well, weather predictions change on a daily basis, so maybe it wouldn't be that bad.   I can only hope.             "
"              Birthday Part Deaux  Yup, yesterday went well, although the picnic at the beach became a picnic behind the bathhouses 'coz the wind was so strong. It was nice and sunny at Mid Brighton Beach, but way too windy. Overall, it was fabulously delicious, I got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles - ie. very squishy n small.  Oooh we went to Hunter Gatherer at Acland Street, St. Kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about $19. Kewl eh? Charles says it makes me look like Jungle Girl, ah but what da hey, you only turn 23 once.   Sigh...23...soon it'll be 25, then 30. How life zooms past. Ever get the feeling?  Anyways, for dinner, EG brought me to this v. nice restaurant by the bay/beach in Williamstown, called Anchorage Restaurant. I had the Sirloin, he had the Eye fillet, even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint. We ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu. By boy, delicious! And the company was good, although it strayed to topics like 'Is it possible to make drunken fries? Or like flambe it or something...', to which we started enacting how we'd do it, like  (cup hands together)  here's a potato,  (jerk arm as if adding seasoning)  add wine, followed by  (flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette)  lighting it, and then  (move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom)  TA DAAA!!!'  10 mins later....  EG: 'Hey, what are those?' Me: (Chewing a rather large piece of medium-rare steak...)  Cup hands together, jerk arm as if adding seasoning, flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette, move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom  EG: 'Potatoes?' Me:  Excitedly pointing left index finger to nose, and right index finger to EG, nodding vigrously, cheeks full of food   The highlight?  EG: 'Eh? You don't want the mushroom ah?' Me: 'Mushroom? What mushroom?' EG: 'Er...that.' Me: 'It's a mushroom? Oh my goodness! I thought it was a really burnt slice of potato! Like, flambe-d or something!'  Yes, my blonde roots were showing.  My parents called later, to wish me a Happy Birthday, as well as my sis this morning. Tho Thweet. And Bart too, half and hour ago (Note to Bart: It's OK!! I still love you! :-) )  How does it feel to turn 23? I really don't know. Ask me again the same day next year.             "
"              Shameless Plug  It's my Birthday today! woohoo! Was born 23 years ago, at 1.41pm (GMT +8hrs - i.e.S'pore time).  So far I've gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly iBook from EG, Charles and Wally, and very adorable Sabi underwear from Bel. It's blue striped with a goldfish in front - she was very excited about it hehe. (Although Charles insists it isn't a goldfish, it's just a fish that's orange-gold in colour. Looking at it, yeah, maybe, but me and Bel will insist it is a goldfish! For my (name)sake!)  We're going for a picnic at Brighton Beach later, and a nice dinner, just me n EG later tonight. Can't wait.   How we decided on Brighton Beach was really amazing! We were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic. So I thot, hmm, somwhere not too far out, but still away from the city. Maybe a beach, or the countryside. Figured, hey, we've passed Brighton beach a coupla times on our way to Ikea in Moorabin, why not give it a go? I still wasn't sure though...  Then EG came home, so I asked him, 'Where should we go?'  'How about Brighton Beach?' I stared at him, while scrambling to find in my brain whether i'd mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something. Nope-didn't.  'You're kidding! I thot of it too! Oh my gosh!' 'Yeah, Shawn's been there once, siad it was pretty good.' 'Oh my gosh! It's a sign I tell you! I even asked Evie about it just now. Maybe God wants us to be there or something...heheh'  Hmm..maybe he does? We'll see. It's amazing how excited I get about the lil' things in life...very easily amused hehe...  Okely dokelies. Will let ya all know what happens next!            "
"              The things she said...  'Did you know that how you hold your chopsticks means how far away your future partner is?'  'Did you know that you can eat the fish's bones? If they're fried enough.'   (Qn: 'Which part of Singapore are you from?')   'Oh, Singapore isn't very big, it's actually smaller than Victoria...we don't really have states.'  Yes, yes, such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting. I really hope people didn't leave thinking 'god, that weird Chinese girl talks waaaay too much'.  'Coz that's what I think I did. Left people with bits of information that they didn't really want to know. Sigh.  On the up side, I think overall it went pretty well. The other staff pple were nice, and so was the meal, at Kun Ming Restaurant at Lt. Bourke St. It's been there for ages apparently, and got a huge do-up recently, leaving it looking pretty posh. Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk.  I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess. But I have a good vibe about the job...the boss, the pple, the place, the uniforms (which me Boss has to re-order 'coz they were a lil' too big). They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....)  Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues! And I gotta study for a Gloria Jeans' exam regarding coffees and the machines etc. Lotsa things to do...and remember. Like 'once a customer enters a store, how soon must you greet him/her?' Answer: within 8 seconds....oooohhhh.....  That's what I'm talking about...             "

"              Bow down to the Red Dragon!...   To paraphrase Ray Fiennes. Just returned from the movie - it wasn't too bad, albeit a lil' predictable towards the end. Does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book? Kenneth believes its different - shan't say more or I'll be accused of being a 'spoiler'.  Anyways, just thot some areas could be developed more, like the relationship between Reba and Francis (aka Mr D. aka Red Dragon aka Psychotically Repressed And Emotionally Abused Serial Killer). Stellar performance from Mr. Hopkins . Wasn't much space for Edward Norton to strut his stuff though. Same goes for Ray Fiennes. Emily Watson was very convincing as Reba, the blinking kewpie doll.   That aside, I also went to Borders and almost bought a book - 'White Teeth' by Zadie Smith (was it Smith?), although was stopped at the last minute by Shawn who said it sucked. He said he was willing to give me his copy, which was back in Singapore though. Damn...  I spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading  the Glamour mag that I'd started the last time I was at Borders. At $11 a pop, I don't have the moola to spend on buying imported mags, so it's Border's free browsing for me. Never got to the last page, but did read an interesting article by Kristen Gore Schiff (Al and Tipper's daughter btw) regarding women, work and motherhood, and why can't women have it all without compromise. I'll prob. read it again, to relook at the fine points she brought up. Did you know that Australia and America are the only two developed countries which have UNPAID maternity leave? tsk tsk....UK has 18 days while Hungary has 24!  A couple months back there was a huge hoo-haa regarding a bill that a women's coalition was trying to pass, that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave. Some said it wasn't economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned. Me? I'm not quite sure where my stand is, 'coz I don't enough about the properties of the bill, nor do I know how much maternity is enough, nor do I know what the so-called economic costs are. So, gotta find out so I can weigh out the costs, and see where I stand.  I do believe, however, that the company she works for should be supportive, and allow her enough time to spend with her child, and not penalise her in monetary terms. In short, motherhood/household maintenance etc. is work!   I wonder if anyone's written a thesis about the whole leave-the-nursing-to-the-maids issue in Asia. How does that affect a woman's stand and her power relations with men and other women? Other than the gender issue, it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too.  Any thots? Leave a bl00p!              "

"              Epitaph  Picture a quiet graveyard in the long-distant future, with craggly grey stones, the smell of green green grass, the trees overhanging as the sun streams through in the fading twilight. You stroll among the chirping birds, the flittering dragonflies, the people walking their dogs amidst the calm serenity.    Then you stop at my tombstone, and etched into the granite are words of wisdom that will follow you eternally.    I CAN'T REPLY TO THAT BECAUSE I AM DEAD.   Aaahhh...a cryptic message from beyond the grave, yet quirky enough to embody my character, my nature, my innate...er...quirkiness.   Whatever you say,   I can't reply to that because I am dead .

Essay garble on dominant ideologies perpetuated via melodramatic forms on television such as the soap opera and even my fav. tv show of the moment,   24 , due to their associations with the domestic sphere and the lack of final resolution. Essay crap on how  Looking for Alibrandi  can be constituted as part of Italian National Cinema even though the entire film is set and shot in Sydney, Australia. Essay vomit on Omar Calabrese's ideas of television seriality and the five dominant prototypes. Essay blobs on the uses of comparative advertising. You get the idea.  I AM FREE!!!

Downside tho's that some pple won't hire you, knowing they have to fork out more). Even after tax (which I can claim back anyway), I'll still be taking back a pretty decent wage. Woohoo!

"              Have you ever?  I'm just wondering is it just me or does everyone sorta put on an accent when they speak with  ang mohs ?  After years of thinking such people as   le poseur , I've come to the conclusion that we can't help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly. I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta.  Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode.   Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing?    Yep, we sure do.     Oh, how much does it cah-st?    Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America.   Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent.   Uh, yeah, I am.    Oh, which part?    Sawrry?    I mean where are you from?    Erm, America? But I'm in Melbourne now....    Oh, erm, er, that's all right, heh. I was trained in San Francisco myself, so I know that you're getting a good price here. Are you a Melbourne Uni student?     Erm yeah, I'm an...exchange student.    Well, Melbourne Uni students get a discount, so that's about (calculate calculate calculate) $63.    Oh cool, ok. Yeah so if I decide to make an appointment I'll ring you guys yeah? Thanksverymuchseeyabyebye.   Dooooot....doooooot....doooot......    Sheesh kabab....

Other than that, the play was hilarious and Ivan Heng was great as everyone's favourite Peranakan Bibik. Especially when Emily started interacting with the audience, and pulled this woman on stage as she was getting to her seat (she was late - thank God we got to the theatre just as they were closing the doors). Made her stand in the corner while everyone laughed, but the woman was laughing too, and enjoying herself. She was finally allowed to return to her seat though, after apologising to the 'class'.

Hehe, yep being the innkeeper at the Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn in Bethlehem has its advantages :-) Whatever it is, portraying a loud brusque  sampat  brothel owner at which the baby Jesus was born proved quite a risque performance at tonight's church Christmas dinner. But it went down pretty well, everyone laughed, and I kept having the aunties and uncles coming up to me and patting me on the back for being such a good actor heeeheee...although some people say it wasn't really acting, I was just being myself. I wonder what they meant by that...hmmm.... :-)  People laughed at unexpected bits too, and especially at the last part where I started coming on to one of the Three Wise Men. Speaking of which, their rendition of 'Dancing Kings' to Abba's tune was an instant hit, coupled with Steven's portrayal of a not-so-wise man bumbling around in his jester hat. It was priceless, to say the least! Also spot-on was Uncle Jimmy's Angel Gabriel, complete with flapping arms substituting as wings, and a lab coat. 'Remember Joseph, what Mary says is true, for women are ALWAYS right!! Ask the married men in the audience!'  Aaaah....the wisdom of an angel.  Special Mention goes to Emily's and Amy's graceful dance, who pulled in the serious note of the play. Sigh, it's just as well that I was  Mamasan and not one of the dancers lah - would've probably fallen flat on my face. Teetering on high heels are fine, but swishing and turning and curving around to a ballad? I'll leave that to the professionals.                  "
"              And the Results are...  Yippee, didn't do too badly for my essays, better than I expected, considering all the last minute work I did hehe. Praise God it all turned out fine...  Yesterday night was a movie marathon as I spent a couple hours under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, watching Y Tu Mama Tambien as part of the Moonlight Cinema festival. The festival runs for about 3 1/2 months till mid March, with screenings of shows like Grease, or Frida or My Big Fat Greek Wedding - basically an eclectic mix of shows, and even Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the festival closer.  Following the nice picnic under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, EG and I joined Charles, Alan and Shawn watching double-o-seven on the big screen at 12.45 am - explosions and diamonds for everybody! I have to admit though, the film's storyline was slightly more interesting than the bland catch-me-if-you-can scenario played out in the last, what, 19 or 20 Bond flicks? This time, he's Renegade! (And the Lorenzo Lamas/ Robinson Crusoe look does become him somewhat, although, Pierce baby, you gotta work at those abs! I spy some double-o flab...)  Recommendations: Lying on a mat under a star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens accompanied by good food, hot chocolate, a blanket and a warm hug. Yumsss...             "
"              Pedal to the Metal  Had my first driving lesson with EG today, at a quiet carpark in Kensington. It was awesome! Had lotsa fun, even though it took me awhile to get the hang out changing gears, releasing the clutch etc. EG said I did pretty well for my 1st lesson, and that I caught on quickly. Hehe - he's a real good teacher actually, encouraging and patient..awwww.....  So I could start all right. The only problem was stopping! Hahaha....took me a long while to get the hang of braking and coming to a gentle stop for some reason. In time...  In other news, I'm playing the mama-san of the inn where Mary and Joseph crash at for the night in our church's Christmas play, held next Saturday. Quite funny lah, me teetering around acting like a Cruella Deville / ham-sap middle-aged lady. I think my favourite line would be when I say to Joseph 'Aiyoh...leng zai (handsome boy)...' and pinch his cheeks. (Either that or 'Welcome to Mamasan's Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn! How can I halpchoo?')  EG's flying back next Sunday...we'll be seperated for about 6 weeks! I'll definitely miss him, n i think it's about the longest we'll be seperated for (or was the Hawaii stint longer?), though it'll also be good to have some time apart and regroup. :-)  How's everyone doing btw?

"              Whoosh  Ever felt the rush of wind against your ears as you take hairpin turns at breakneck speed? Yep, just did it - paid 60 buckaroos to whirl around a go-kart track for 1 hour.  I left thinking, 'Man, I'm such a wuss!' and how I didn't get my money's worth for the 3 runs round the track (Australian Grand Prix rules), 'coz I didn't overtake and cut corners as much as I should've. Next time, I will. But dammit, I was afraid of crashing, and my arms were really tired from turning - really had to use my arm strength. Added to that I'd injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey. Sigh - the injuries from my go-karting expedition happened b4 the race'd even started!  But going at pedel-to-the-metal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience. Some people call it a speed rush; me, I call it time to pray. I think it was scary 'coz the turns came up too soon - didn't get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding. And when someone crashed into me, boy was it painful - lurched forward in my seat.   I hate having other drivers really tagging close to me too - so I just give way. See? Whadda wuss haha.... :-) I guess that'll make me a semi-safe driver in real life (which reminds me, EG's supposed to teach me next week. Woohoo!) Anyways, I think I'll try the other track up in Sunshine soon - the Port Melbourne one, in a converted warehouse, just seems too small. Oh, and with a smaller group, so I don't have to keep slowing down when the amber lights start flashing 'coz someone's just crashed.                "

"              Intense  That was the expression on Eminem's face in 8 Mile. Either that or Intense-stoned. The only 2 expressions captured on camera thoughout the movie. Oh yeah, and when he gets pissed off - then that's Beat-the-shit-outta-you-Intense.     Phew!  The pic was pretty all right - very character-driven, although it tended to drag a bit. Parts I liked? The scene where he raps/sings to 'Sweet Home Alabama', in his words of course. Also the touching couple of minutes when he's tucking his younger sis (or daughter? the movie's pretty vague about it) into bed and sings her to sleep. (Side note though; Emmy, baby, stick to da yo-ho-ho-rap n leave da singin' to da professionals, ya know what I'm sayin', bro?). Oh and the mandatory shag scene, I'd like to think, was thrown in for good measure just to prove a) he digs Britney Murphy's character, Alex,  b) to show how trite and meaningless sex is today, and c) just to please the bulk of the movie's audience made up of adolescents wanting to Be Like Em, who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh, esp. Murphy's (although let's not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lily-white ass to the audience as part of the Rap Battle Royale sequence at the end).  That said, with those intense close-ups of Emmy's face, I think he's actually kinda cute. Symmetrical features, piercing blue eyes. In fact, he could down right be a nice sweet ol' guy. He's a romantic, a passionate poet at heart, his melodic lyrics inspiring this shattered world to greater heights. Save for the parts where he wants to kill his ex-wife of course.              "

After a long while trying to figure out where she lived (her English wasn't very good - I think she's Italian), and after calling Charles countless times, and after rearranging my meeting with Bridget, I was finally off to Ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my blood-line, my mobile phone. Where all my contacts (and the free pass-SMS to 'Chicago') were stored.   Mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me, to which I gave her an impulsive hug, so relieved I was. Phew. That's almost-losing my phone twice within a few months. I really have to get into the habit of looking behind me before I leave. Bugger.             "

"              CNY just around the corner   Yep, it is. And I have many things to prepare for the church picnic that's going on then, on  chu er  specifically. Like source for goodies, and prepare flyers, and organise transportation. Many things to do!  But I guess it keeps me busy.  To my fiathful readers (yes, all 3 of you...), sorry I haven't been updating regularly, just been caught up with the daily grind of life (ironic seeing how Gloria Jean's slogan is 'Escape the daily grind' - geddit? coffee? grind? oh never mind...). So as you can tell, the blog's been a little anorexic. That and coupled with the fact there's really nothing much happening in my life now...doodeedoodeedoo...  Let's see, maybe I should change my writing style. Instead of a journal-esque what-happened-today kinda report, maybe I should just deliver quirky excerpts, or at least working harder at putting a spin to the events that unfold daily.  How's this for a change?  'Driving...euphorically exciting, especially the feeling of controlling a revving machine under my feet. A small tap and it roars, a release and it stalls. Machinery built for ease, yet deadly in so many ways. Can't wait till the next lesson. I love driving.'  Hmm...maybe I should just stick to my day job.               "

"              Cruise Control  I had my first  paid  driving lesson today. Let's just say I'm starting with another instructor on Monday. 'Coz Sprint Driving School's instructor really sucks in the personality department.  He was this guy in his 30s, gruff, with curly hair, Nike sunglasses and Bunker shoes. Spoke with some pseudo-French accent, and was talking to me as if I were a small ant, nay, the food that ants eat. Harrumph.  So I'm going with Shawn's instructor. Was planning to do so, until he quoted me a slightly higher price - $27 for 45 mins, compared to Sprint's $25. So I figured, since Sprint's first lesson is $20, with a free one before the test, I'd just go for it, then decide. Sprint sucks. So I'll be meeting David and his late-model Toyota Corolla at the VicRds carpark on Monday.  Horns kept honking at me today as I took to the congested streets in the Southbank area. Never again! Eurgh... 'Phress youhr brahkes, hwhy youh afrhaid of phressing yourh brahkes?...Tuhrn here tuhrn left here...' while nary a smile cracked his  kwali -face veneer. Sigh.  Hope the next lesson goes better.             "
"              Bleepin' Fooo   *Parental Guidance advised. This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).*  Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose.  There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett.  The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess.  'Hey!' I said when I felt the push.   'Stupid fucking chink' he said at the same time, as he walked on.  I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, 'What an asshole!'  Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back 'Hey what's the matter with you?'  The Pudge turned around. 'She didn't move outta the way.'  'And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man' Shawn replied before turning around.  The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than 'you wanna piece o' me', and more cheesy than 'bring it on'. Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of 'Settle!!' while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end.   Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating 'So what?'  'Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?' I said. I was ignored.  There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers.  And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)?  Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed 'Ow' she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter 'Bitch' UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it.  So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful 'thank you for being so niiiice', and 'God loves you'  (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of 'whatever'. And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men).  As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, 'hey we can do this right now, man. Come on...' The Pudge just fudged his battle.  Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to 'ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that'   We smiled, 'yeah, that's good to know. Thanks'. They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile.  It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a  Woman  of  Asian  descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe]  If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today.   Try calling  her  a stupid effin' chink.    5 January 2003           "

"              Hair again  It's more or less faded now, so it isn't that orangey. Unfortunately the streak that I like on the front seems to have faded too. Not as dashing!  EG's family have arrived and are doing well, holed up at Oakford Mews, off Commercial Rd in South Yarra. Really looks quite new, very poshy and nice, serviced-apartments.   And Ethan is soooo adorable! He's only a year and a half, and he's already speaking and READING! and COUNTING! He can count to a hundred! And in multiples of two! And read Chinese words. And he knows the names of the authors who wrote his books, like 'Eric Hill' for his See Spot Run books etc. WOW. What a kid. And everytime he goes 'Aunty Sarah, Read' I just melt. What a guy. Cute, intelligent, and he smells so nice. Yummers.  EG got his new maroon Holden Vectra today. Not bad. Hehee...can't wait till I get to drive it around...muahahah...  Yeah..I guess that's more or less what's been happening. Haven't had much of a chance to blog 'coz been busy. Haven't even been on the Net all that often either! I really wanna get away for a weekend though, just to recoup and feel like I've actually had a holiday/vacation this summer, before school starts. And it's starting in 3 weeks! EURGH. SO not lookign forward to it. But it's the last leg. Shouldn't be too bad...             "
"              Hair today, gone tomorrow...  Hate my hair. Not the cut - love the cut. Just the colour. What was supposed to turn out as a pink block at the bottom of my wispyish chin-length bob turned into a chalky orangey-red mess.  And the best part was, I'd spent 1...2...3...4 and a half hours doing it!!!!!! Wah lau eh....  3 hours to bleach it, and it was still not white enough, but me and the stylist, a 17 year old sweet young student, decided we should just go ahead a try it. Then she had to mix up some colour 'coz they ran out of the one I wanted, and the teacher said the mix'll do. But combined with blondish hair, it came out less funky Pink and more Hong Kong Ah Lian.   What should I do now? Should I dye it all black (and maybe do a couple of red 20-minute streaks)? Or should I wait a week (as suggested by one of the supervisors) and bleach it again, then do the colour myself, using the Fudge range of semi-permanent colours?  Dammit....good thing it was only $32.10 for the cut and colour.                 "

"              Picnic  Wow, today's CNY picnic for church was a load off my mind. Praise God for the good weather, and everything went smoothly, and everyone had a good time. All the running around, blood, sweat and tears was worth it.  We had games - a group skits, CNY karaoke competition, and of course, a Lion Dance! Oh man, spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes. Darn...what a waste.  If I had server space, I'd upload some photos so u guys can check out...but unfortunately...ah wells. But trust me, we had a lot of fun, and lots to eat, and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves, and we also had sparklers too! And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh?  A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying 'I'm not Asian!' under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled.  I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults.  I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.   They can thank me for it later.             "

"              Back home  EG flew back yesterday to settle some visa stuff, and praise God, he's got it down n settled, and it lasts till March 31st 2005. Woohooo!  I called me mum yesterday to talk, and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers' future. Seems like the older one's acting up again, understandable seeing how he's going through the teenage angst years, but he's more difficult than she's imagined it to be, and she's worried over the company he's been mixing with, who've recently been caught shoplifting. Stealing for the Winona Ryder-esque thrill of it. And we're talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here. Bored rich kids who don't understand the value of money, who bandy about their fathers' wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys, sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them, like my brother. Maybe I'm being judgemental here, but I honestly don't care, just wish my bro would wise up. Sigh, the  financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone.  I'm hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses, at least till I graduate. I missed the boat on the rent one, which subsidises about $60 a week, but hopefully  there are others I can apply for. It's no-strings-attached, so prayerfully, that'll work out somewhat, to alleviate the financial burden on my parents.   It's quite pathetic how I keep running to God only when I'm in trouble or worried, however understandle it is, being a part of human nature. Yet sometimes I wish I could find the passion I once had about church and reading his Word, yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that I can't find a reason to, or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my Bible to read and meditate.  Although I see myself reaching out some way, in my little human form, for that vast expanse that is 'spirituality' and 'passion for God' yet coming up short most times.   Is it the engagement of the topic however? Does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate? We (and I say we in the broadest sense 'coz I think most of us tune out once in awhile) learn when we're receptive and humour creates such an environment. How much then, do we learn when we switch off or don't connect with the speaker sometimes? But beside the Sunday agenda, there's more work to do to, on a daily basis, building such a close relationship, which to be honest, makes me wish I could have a proper conversation with God - as in hear audibly and see physically. Are real relationships based on this? The seeing and hearing and touching and feeling? The tangibility of the other?  Ah wells...back to my little worm hole I guess...         "
"              Numb  Today was a day spent waking up late, rushing to work at 7am (was supposed to be there at 6.30 only to be woken up by a piercing phone call at 6.45), rushing to school, going to bridge road, walking around hunting for a pair of good black shoes to wear to work and with jeans for winter 'coz the pair I'm wearing right now is literally falling apart, failing to do source said pair, going to Myer in the City, finding a good pair only to find out they'd sold out of the black one in my size (curse my status-quo size 7 feet), having the salesgirl call up all the Myer stores in Victoria, finally finding the LAST PAIR in the WHOLE of VICTORIA and thankfully not too far away, grateful for fiance for offering to drive me and my numb tired feet to Doncaster to pick it up, only to arrive at his office to sit about for one and a half hours waiting for said kind generous fiance to finish work and whisk me off to buy shoes.

"               A Tribute to my Father  I will always remember my dad as a strong man, with shoulders broad enough for six-year-old me to perch on; he with the round tummy, a twitch in his moustache, and a twinkle in his eye.  I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing 'I Spy with my Little Eye' as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out 'No Pa! It's the TV lah!'  I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me. And how he embraced the next, now my fiance, into the warm folds of our family.  For all this, I say, Thank You Dad, for being the head of our household, for being inspiring and uplifting, for being the earthly image of our Father up above. Thank you for caring, thank you for loving, and thank you for leading me in my life. God bless, and I love you.            "

I know I haven't been blogging much, so to calculate, I would have to say it's the number of people who actually know about this blog, coupled with the trajectory of minute comet fragments floating down from space after burning up in the atmosphere, multiplied by the incessant number of phone calls answered in the cinema by a loud 'ah, an zua? watching movie lah', divided by the intensity of Fear Factor contestants' projectile vomit after searching for objects in a tank full of live maggots WITH THEIR MOUTHS, which brings me to a grand total of...two, yes TWO people who read this blog regularly besides me.

I haven't been there, mostly 'coz I've been away of course, and I'm not exactly the type you see raving up the clubbing scene.   So tell me, is it all right to feel that slight wee bit nervous at impressing former classmates whom you want to think that you are  a) beautiful b) witty and intelligent c) thin?

I feel lost, often directionless when it comes to this new project.

Such a privilege - and I'm getting paid for it too! Yay!!!  It really brings home the lesson 'I'm Strong in your Weaknesses' (to paraphrase the verse). Praise God - He's been so good to me.

"              Another 'ilarious encounter  Here's an excerpt from an email from my mum, who'd quote-unquote 'nearly 'pengsan' laughing after reading the grapefruit account (Sat 25 October's post):  ------------------------------------------------------- Hi Sweeties,   Read Sarah's blog linked to Bart's blog on the Grapefruit episode, I nearly 'peng-san' laughing. Good fun for the week.   Maybe share with you this one just heard from a visiting pastor from Malaysia.   Pastor Gan from Malaysia shared that some years back, he offered his home to shelter a village girl from Ipoh, who was an orphan. One day, she had some food particles stuck between her teeth and asked this pastor friend of mine what to do. Pastor Gan offered her a string of dental floss and taught her how to do it. She went into the bathroom and didn't come out till quite some time. Pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes. Then, handed the dental floss string back to Pastor and said 'I washed it many times already. Return to you.'  hahahhahaha...some ulu kampong girl....  Mummy....  -----------------------------------------------------   Disclaimer: 'ulu kampong girl' is not descriptive of all girls from Ipoh, nor the greater area of Western Malaysia...           "
"              Kaploink  Just some random thoughts  1. Congrats to Karen and Jon, for entering a period of courtship!! May God bless you in this journey of discovery together! 2. Terence and Brenda have decided to name their son Joel Ong Li En!! (and mind you, it's 'Jo-EL' not 'Jo'll'. El as in Hebrew for 'son'. In which case, shouldn't he be named 'Ter-El' or 'Bren-El' ?) 3. Feeling bloaty. I pity the people around me when the gas gets expelled, one way or another... 4. Living the righteous life, dying to self, living and serving the one true living God...... is DAMN hard!!! (pardon my french). And tho' I know it's worth it, the turmoil of making conscious right choices has turned my world upside down, on end. We're not called to lead the easy life, we're called for greater things, to be dynamic infusions that pervade humanistic, hedonistic society...to Live. And sometimes I just want to crawl under a rock and give in to the tempations that rock my world, that provide relief and not rest. To not think and just carry on in the doing of things.

"              Halp...  There are just some days when you come off feeling inadequate, and often times, insignificant. Tuesdays are those for me, often times 'coz the Exec. team meetings are long and arduous, and whatever little I contribute seem of even lesser importance.   But that's just today. Most times, it's pretty all right, it's just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of God's kingdom is pretty intimidating. Plus the fact that it starts at 8.30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodness-knows-what reason.  Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake. To be honest, the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his Word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this. Need discipline!!  Ah wells, just a bit of a whinge s'all.            "

"              Friends and friend-sters alike  I'm currently hooked on this whole  urlLink Friendster  business, and am unearthing friends and acquaintances from eons ago.  It's like Six Degrees of Seperation gone mad!  Currently, with my personal direct network of 23 friends, I'm linked to more than 140 000 people! How bizarre is that?  Although, I'd have to say, a friend did make a pertinent point. How many REAL friends have we made thru' this crazy machination? Or are we just content finding long-lost friends? Or is it the fun of bragging rights (hey, i have 245 friends and you only have 18!! How pathetic are  you ?)  So far the experience has been interesting. Hooking up and messaging ex-classmates and realising they know people whom I know too.

"              Jesus (Pop) Freak...  Came across  urlLink this article  via  urlLink Winnie's  xanga blog, and a whole lotta questions ran through my mind.  It throws up a lot of issues to do with the convergence of religion with mainstream pop culture, and the harkening of 'being the salt and light of the world' - to influence (rather than be influenced). In this case, who's influencing whom? Mass media or Christianity? Are we merely using whatever means necessary to reach today's jaded youth? To 'reclaim' popular culture? Or has popular culture claimed us? Is usurping pop culture a means to an end? But to what extent? Has it become a turn-off? Jesus can be cool, and he sure can be radical. But so what?  Any thoughts?            "
"              I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes...  So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of 'Love Actually'.  And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch!  The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances).  Truth be told, the movie should really be titled 'Lust Actually', or 'Luff Actually'. It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love -  choosing  to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the 'sweet pure agony of being  in  love'.  One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as  (can you believe it?)  the British Prime Minister!!   Like i said, it was hilarious!  (Although I must say, Mr Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways...)  Look out for the cameos!          "
"              Ponder  I've just finished a book by Francine Rivers called 'And the Shofar Blew'. It's a very real, telling, tale of the lives lead by a Pastor and his wife, called to serve a local community when the church's pastor retires. The book weaves intricately, and into depth, of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry, into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad, the respected leader of a well-known mega-church.  It's not a plot-driven book. The climax is almost predictable, and the pace tends to dawdle at times. But the attention to emotional detail is amazing, and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do, while facing their daily demons.   I expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment, of longing, that the journey I'd begun had ended all too shortly. But surprisingly, it left me cold. A cool splash to wake me up, to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry, of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel. Are we building projects too fast, steamrolling whatever (or whoever) gets in the way of progress? Am I constantly listening to the Spirit's guidance? Is this what the Lord wants? These questions were whirring through my head as I finished the last chapter.  And I have no answers. Not yet anyways. And I'm glad for reading that book - not just due to its entertainment factor - but for the fact that it got me thinking. And to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry, my calling (which may throw doubts in the face of faith - always an unpopular approach). To think of what I'm doing, and how it ties in with the Purpose of My life, and to think about why I choose to do what I do; why I work on the projects I do right now; whether I'm going along with the flow 'coz it's my job; do I truly believe what I say I should believe in for 2004?  Questions questions questions.   It's good, I think. At least I'm thinking, and not following along like a blind herded sheep. The answers, I believe, lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my Self - the Self that's lazy, unmotivated, procrastinating, happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me. And I  know  that's not how life should be; rolling with the punches, drifting from pleasure to pain and back again. There's more!  Wake up Sparky!!             "

Really feeling the change in taking an active role of leadership in the church. Even friends have pointed it out, although a part of me is still reluctant to accept that I have changed, and for the better too. I'm more passionate, more vocal, feeling the zest to be close to God. (Yet strangely hypocritical 'coz I havent' been reading my Bible or spending time praying as much as I should. And it's not for anyone's, or God's sake that I do it mind you, it's really for my own.

One old friend shouted 'Oi, you asking your 'chingay' what is the time or you asking 'what time will be chingay be on?'

Just watched Honey - am inspired once again (though not by the stilted acting) to 'shake my tailfeather'. 8. Thinking of taking dance class so I 'booty to the beat, 'yo' like Jessica Alba in Honey (and to lose said CNY kilos). 9. Thinking of volunteering at local campus radio station to 'get back into the game'. 10. Should really stop annoying habit of speaking in 'quotation marks'.  Also, I confess, in my MTV-fuelled madness while back home, I bought 'In The Zone' (simply because  I can  and  I like her ok? ). Needless to say, my friends have disowned me, my brothers loathe me, and my pet fish and I are no longer on speaking terms.  Sigh.   ;)             "

In a space of only 15 minutes at Mark Teo's b'day dinner/bunch time, in between the meal and cake-cutting (it was a challenge by the fellow bunch members) last week! *pat pat pat on the back* haha...  Am v. excited. Have gotten good reviews so far, and it's even inspired a cabaret-style performance idea, with life-sized props to illustrate the story, with Ellen (Philpott) and assorted backup singers/dancers in shiny costumes bobbing up and down, holding top hats and canes! Very showy, but what would you expect from a song to the tune of Copacabana?!  Imagine...a darkened theatre, a solitary spotlight focussed onstage, where a lone figure sits on a barstool, her head bowed down, capped by a black fedora. The tune plays over the sound system, and on cue, I pop my head up and start singing, softly at first, then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me, while the dancers carry the life-sized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and..and...and...  Phew!! Gotta get my head outta the clouds....            "

"              Hellos agains  I have so much to get done before the week/day's up, especially in terms of the Annual Dinner that I'm planning that's coming up. So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to  NOT  work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn  exams  just get in the way!!  Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me.   I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in 'teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime', that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.)  As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!!  Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!          "
"              Just  what  are collared greens??!!  Tonight was spent, quite lovely in fact, in the presence of like individuals who enjoy the oftentimes eccentric humour shared intrinsically. Yes, we're all kooks. That's why our bunch's called 'Out of the Box'.  That aside, it was pretty fun to revisit the Veggietales 'King George and the Ducky',not least Larry's silly song on Barbara Manatee. BUt mostly, it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our song-and-dance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner.  In the words of Bob the Tomato, 'have we got a show for you!!'  Suffice to say, we're ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it. They're songs that kids would appreciate I presume, not least for the fact they're composed by a bunch of adults with very kid-like mentalities. I can imagine the spiel: 'Bible characters come to life in this charming stage rendition of stories like you've never heard them before!' Cue spotlight as the cast emerges.  I'm lovin' it!          "
"              Brrr...it's cold in here...there must be some Torros in the atmosphere...  It's officially the start of Winter, and the chills are setting in.  Surprisingly though, today was still pretty warm. I guess 'coz it's only the 9th day of winter. Which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an Intern at ACCF!!  (applause applause)   Today's BIG QUESTION:  What does it mean to live a life that's  adventurously expectant ?   Romans 8:15 [MSG]: The resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike, 'what's next, Papa'?   I guess for me, a life that's lived adventurously is one that's on the edge (however cliche that sounds!), built in faith. Expectancy calls for faith, calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities. Adventurously - that's a call to be daring, to leave our comfort zones.  So today, I shall begin like this: I adventurously expect...  Post your adventurous expectancies, people! (in the comments section)              "

"              Dissociative Identity Disorder aka Multiple Personality Disorder aka (only by popular usage) Schizophrenia   A word can trigger off many emotions, and the consequent turmoil as the mind and spirit tries to grasp one that befits the occasion is...well...confusing. It's like playing word association, where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses.    These are the words for me: Aunty Yvonne CNY Angpow Chicken Wings Wedding Funeral Life Support Heart Lung Breath Cancer Crash Distant Close Love Home Tim Danny Adeline Daisy Telok Blangah Short hair Maternal Peace Heaven Love  I wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations, stop-gaps to create a sense of connection, like I'm grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers.   I don't know what to feel, and I'd gather most in my situation wouldn't as well. Sad, yes but yet, at times, not really. It's only when triggers appear, or when I'm not distracted by something else, work, people, church. Like I'm trying every emotion in the spectrum for size, to see how it fits. Do I grieve? Yes I guess, where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably, but not very long each time, and anyways, just what are the rules for the mourning process? So new, this is. So very new.  I wonder if my Grandma realises what's happened. And I wonder what that would trigger in her too - will she babble and smile, and greet familiar faces at the wake, not comprehending its significance? Or worse, understand the full painful  measure of the loss of a child?  Too many thoughts to ponder...         "
"              Embarking  In about an hour's time I'll be on my way to Flinders, in the Mornington Peninsula area for an overnight camp/retreat/intensive with the rest of the community. We're going to be Equipped in tools, teaching, and the bonds of friendship, this Weekend, to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world.  I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial.  She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now...  I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a 'she  might  be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family.  We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully. Uncomprehendingly.           "
"              Lull  Am suddenly filled with the depressive haze that assaults me in periodic moments.  After the high from learning and utilising my brain at the Rikk Watts seminar over the last couple of days, coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal, I'm suddenly feeling really, really, for lack of a better word,  sian .  I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job.  And there's the praying meeting in an hour-and-a-half's time, which I don't feel like going to, yet don't wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching TV or a movie. It's a waste of time, which I've always known, yet can't seem to tear myself from. Hence I've to put my foot down on that one right now. Which is why I'm going for the meeting. Altho' of course, a huge part is so I won't disappoint the people who expect me to be there - BUT! If that element serves to stop me from distracting myself with other meaningless objects, then so be it.  ARGH. The groans and pains of a growing Christian living in the POST-post-modern world. Blech.           "
"              Grandma  I was suddenly reminded of my grandma. Of the fraility of life. Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision?  I wrote this in response, to that reminder:  'I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned.  But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist.'  To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength.  He  is. And will be.            "
"              Food Alert  Am reading a book Charles  lent to me called  Eat Chocolate, Drink Alcohol and Be Lean and Healthy  by Andrew Jobling.  Sounds impossible? Yeah it does to me too.  But catchy title aside, it's pointing out that nutritional dieting may not neccesarily mean a deprivation of all luscious food, great and holy. From the glimpses I've had, it's pointing out how moderation is key, understanding how your body works, and maintaining a healthy relationship with food to ensure quality life over YEARS. So that means a good balanced meal of protein, veggies, and YES! CARBS and FAT even! HAH! Take that, consumer marketing....No fads. Watching your Glycemic intake, eating smaller but more frequent meals, among other things. So bring on the chockkies, (just not as much tho'!) :-)  On another note, am also checking out this supposedly free weight-loss programme, also touting long term effects, by watching calories. Hmmm...  Oh well, we'll see how it goes. Don't worry folks, am not planning significant weight-loss, just wanna tone up and de-train myself from the unhealthy obsession with processed junk food (that's not just at Maccers but in your local supermarket too! Sob....). Am signing up with the Arrow gym too! Can ya believe it? Target date: by Yuli's wedding in December...         "

"                     I'm so sad right now.  It's sad that I feel the way I do.  I shouldn't be this upset over a person.  Letting this feeling ruin my mood and my evening.  But it's happening.  I don't know if this is real or my mind and my heart are distorting my actual feelings to make it seem like I should be feeling this bad or that I actual love him this much.  I just wish he would just take me back so we can be happy.  I know I can make him happy.  If only he knew.  I feel like such a loser, it doesn't even make sense.  Someone should get a gun and put me out of my misery because I am making a fucking mockery out of my self not to mention embarrassing my self.  God.  Love Sucks!  It just grabs a hold of you and jerks you all around and then throws you on the ground and leaves you there all bruised and bloody.  Not to mention hurting and confused.

"                       I am so in love.  It is ridiculous.  I'm sure that he loves me too, but I don't know if he loves me with the intensity that I love him.  Shit I'm thinking of him throughout the day.  Talking about him constantly.  It seems to come from out of no where.  Natay this, Natay that.  I know people get tired of it.  I do too.  It only makes my fall harder and stay deeper in the feelings I cannot seem to control.  I just want to be with him forever.  It sucks, because when it doesn't happen I am going to be sooooo hurt.  Man, I can almost feel it just thinking about it.  Why can't I just have him.  I don't know if I can't, but I don't know if I can either.  This not knowing sure sucks.  I don't like it.  What did he do to make me fall for him so.  He is just wonderful.  He's beautiful.  He has a beautiful person.  He's so true and so honest.  How many guys out there are this good.  There probably are  a lot, but how much rubbish do you have to crawl through to find them.  Too much.  I just want to keep him.  It makes me feel so dreamy and so longing and the same time thinking about it.  I think I'd be so happy if I could be with him forever.  We have so much fun together.  Laughing, talking playing, smiling.  We just genuinely have a great time in each other's company.  Love, it is something funny isn't it.  The emotions it takes you through.  But it can feel so good.  Just being in love.  Man I want to see him right now.  I can wait until I see him this weekend.  I'm like a kid getting ready to go to Disney land for the first time.  May the lord bless me with sweet dreams tonight.               "
"                   God I miss my ex so much.  We broke up about a month ago.  He broke up with me.  He says he has a lot on his mind and he doesn't know what direction his life is taking and he doesn't want to hold me back.  Hold me back from what?  From who?  He's who I want to be with.  Does he really mean he doesn't want to hold himself back?  He says that he's not even sure he wants to settle down for good.  He doesn't know if I'm the last girl he wants to date.  Oh.  Okay.  Now I'm sitting here missing him.  The wierd thing is at first it didn't even seem like we had broken up because we still did all the same things.  But now that I've moved out, we're not together all the time anymore.  So now the reality of it is setting in.  We're not together.  I love him so much.  All I can do is shake my head, sigh and hope for the best.                 "

"                 It's been  urlLink mentioned before , but I just can't stand the way people with infertility&nbsp;are&nbsp;portrayed&nbsp;by the media, especially those who choose to pursue ART (assisted reproductive technology).&nbsp;Unless they are celebrities like Courteney Cox Arquette or Brooke Shields, chances are they will be portrayed as&nbsp;psychopaths with ulterior motives.   For once, Hollywood is lined right up with the  urlLink religious fanatics  who believe IVF is a mortal sin and&nbsp;equate the process to a 'sloppy high school science project' in which lives are casually discarded&nbsp;because the parents are too selfish to accept 'the will of God' that they were 'not meant to have children'&nbsp;( real quotes  from Human Life International's website.)&nbsp;In&nbsp;a different situation, these statements would be seen as ludicrous: 'Oh,&nbsp;you have cancer? Well, sorry, looks like it's not the will of God for you to live.&nbsp;What?&nbsp;You want treatment?&nbsp;Oh no, that would be selfish! Why don't you go pray for a while and let us know how it works out. If it's God's plan for you to live, you will live.'&nbsp;No one in their right mind would actually say this to someone with cancer. But when it comes to infertility there is an astonishing&nbsp;lack of compassion for those unlucky enough to have to deal with it.   You don't have to watch much primetime TV to get a glimpse of some of the outrageous views that are out there. Just the other night I was watching  Law and Order: Criminal Intent , an episode entitled 'Ill-Bred.' (I know, already you can see where this is going.) The episode is set on a horse farm where there have been some mysterious activities going on. The detectives suspect that the female owner of the farm is using the horses to smuggle&nbsp;cocaine&nbsp;into the U.S.&nbsp;from overseas. When the truth comes out, they discover that in fact, the smuggling was orchestrated by Paige, a stable worker. In addition to running her own little drug cartel using equine uteruses as transport (proving right off the bat that she's a sicko), Paige had also manipulated her husband into having an affair with the married stable owner and made sure that a pregnancy would result by slipping fertility drugs into her husband's chewing tobacco and poking pinholes in his condoms. Her plan was to blackmail the rich owner and&nbsp;then buy her own horse farm, leaving her unsuspecting husband in the dust. Her plan works, until the detectives show up.   Now, what frustrates me is that most people won't realize how ridiculous the entire premise of the story is. Most people have no reason to understand how fertility works; it's not something they ever need to think about. As my sister Keegan remarked the other day, 'You don't care how electricity works until your lights go out.' Unfortunately, my lights have gone out and so I've done a lot of research and consequently I&nbsp;know way more about infertility than the average OB/Gyn. (I'm only exaggerating a little.)   There are multiple problems with the story, but here are the most glaring.   1) Paige secretly gives her husband the fertility drug gonadotropin in his chewing tobacco.  -Gonadotropin cannot be administered orally; it can only be given by injection. I am going to be taking this drug soon, and believe me, if there were any way to take it orally I would know about it!   2) The gonadotropin makes him produce extraordinarily large amounts of sperm, guaranteeing that he will impregnate Paige's boss.  -Gonadotropin is regularly used in women to stimulate ovulation. It is rarely used in men, and when it is, it is only for existing problems like an extremely low sperm count. It will not produce 'super sperm' in men who are already producing sperm normally. And among men who do have sperm problems, gonadotropin only succeeds in increasing sperm for about 15% of them.   3) While questioning the husband, Detective D'Onofrio tells him he's been taking fertility drugs. 'That's impossible,' he says. Detective D slyly asks, 'Have you felt an extra 'spring in your step' lately?' 'Yeah,' the husband counters, 'what of it?' Detective D: 'Thank you, fertility drugs.'  -This one annoys me most of all because it perpetuates the myth that sperm production is related to libido and sexual prowess. In reality there is no connection. You can't tell how many sperm you're producing by how sexually charged you feel. Fertility has nothing to do with libido. And fertility drugs are not a more expensive alternative to Viagra. In fact, they often have the opposite effect and cause the patient to lose all interest in sex because of the hormonal roller coaster his or her body is subjected to in the course of treatment.   So, to sum up, real life&nbsp;people who use fertility drugs are not all crazy, manipulative and&nbsp;greedy. And  Law and Order 's writers need to do better research before writing their scripts. Thank you, and good night.                 "
"                 I remember the first time I went on the pill, just before getting married, and how awful and pukey&nbsp;I felt for the first few weeks. So after two days of ingesting my little pink friends, I was feeling&nbsp;rather proud of myself for feeling absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Until yesterday afternoon. At around 4:00 I felt a slight twinge in my forehead, which gradually developed into a full-blown, jackhammer-through-my-temples headache.  &nbsp; When bedtime came around my head was still pounding, so I decided to do a bit of yoga to get centered and relax it into submission. I was about 10 minutes into my practice doing a forward bend (and I must say, a pretty&nbsp;good one too,&nbsp;with my chest flat against my legs and my head gently stretching towards the floor)&nbsp;when all of a&nbsp;sudden I was wrenched out of my peaceful zen-like state by a spasm in my esophagus.&nbsp;Before I could&nbsp;utter a single 'om,' I was watching the contents of my dinner&nbsp;plummet towards&nbsp;my sticky mat.  &nbsp; Now, I know it's normal to feel nauseous while practicing yoga. But tossing my cookies in a completely inverted position was&nbsp;a brand new experience for me, and one I hope I don't repeat. After cleaning up I decided I'd had enough yoga for one night and crawled into bed with Alverice, who stroked my hair until I fell asleep like the amazing man that he is.  &nbsp; Today the headache is still hanging on. I think tonight I'll skip the yoga and go straight to bed.              "
"                 Yesterday was the official start of the IVF process, and what a start it was! I&nbsp;had&nbsp;an 8:30 a.m. appointment for&nbsp;my baseline sonogram and day three bloodwork. Since the clinic is about half an hour away, I set my alarm for 7:15, figuring that would give me plenty of time to get nice and pretty for Dr. Ambrosine. Alverice had volunteered to cover for a coworker and was at the office from 11:00 p.m. on Saturday until 6:00 a.m. I never sleep well when he's gone. It's not that I miss him - although I do - it's just that I am such a creature of habit that when something is different it throws me off. Couple that with the fact that Walker&nbsp;has a cold and kept sneezing directly into my face&nbsp;every 5 minutes or so, and that added up to a long night with no&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp;The last time I looked at the clock it was 4:30.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The next time I looked at it, it was 8:15. What the eff?!? As it turned out, Alverice had climbed into&nbsp;bed at 6:30, and when my alarm went off 45 minutes later he reached over and turned it off without even waking up. Knowing that if I didn't make it to my appointment&nbsp;we would have to postpone our IVF by an entire month, I was frantic. I threw on a t-shirt and jeans, stuffed my hair into a ponytail, ran out to my car and sped all the way to the RE's office, half-awake the entire way.  &nbsp;  When I got there at 8:50 I dashed into the waiting room and apologized profusely to the receptionist. She gave me a quizzical&nbsp;smile and said, 'Well hello Chelsea ... what are you doing here so early? We have you down for 11:45. Didn't the scheduling nurse call you?'  &nbsp;  No, in fact, she had  not  called me. But that's OK, that's OK,&nbsp;the good news is I almost killed myself trying to get to an appointment for which I was three hours early!  &nbsp;  I waited for an hour, reading National Geographic through bleary eyes. Finally they called me back to get my vein punctured by a very grumpy phlebotomist. I couldn't blame her for being grumpy; who wants to be at work on a Sunday morning? And knowing that your day is going to consist entirely of sticking bitter,&nbsp;barren women with needles? I couldn't blame her one bit. After&nbsp;taking a nice&nbsp;little vial&nbsp;of my blood she directed me back to the examination room with the oh-so-friendly ultrasound machine and told me to strip.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For those of you not familiar with the&nbsp;fertility sonogram process, it is not at all like the ultrasound you get once you're pregnant, with the little curved&nbsp;transducer&nbsp;and the&nbsp;goopy lube on your belly. That is a much cuter process than this one. When the doctor is checking out your ovaries, she uses an internal wand. Here's a photo to tickle your imagination.   &nbsp; urlLink      The ultra-friendly ultrasound wand, AKA the 'dildo cam'.&nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  Thanks to my insanely bad menstrual cramps, it wasn't such&nbsp;a fun time having that thing probing around inside of me. I mean, I'd take it over an HSG any day, but still. I distracted myself by pretending that Dr. Ambrosine was my fairy godmother, waving her wand at my ovaries and giving them&nbsp;magic powers.  &nbsp;  When the probing was over, she told me everything looked great and we were good to go for IVF #1. She gave me a prescription for birth control pills, which are used to suppress egg production so that when you start the stimulation drugs, it's like 'BAM! Take that, you lazy ovaries!' and they respond&nbsp;by churning out dozens of eggs.&nbsp;I'll receive the details of my protocol in the mail sometime later this week. Basically, my treatment will go something like this:  &nbsp;  1)Birth control pills for 4 weeks for suppression  2)Lupron injections for 5 days  3)Gonal-F and Repronex injections&nbsp;for 8-12 days, depending on how I respond  4)Trigger shot  5)Egg retrieval  6)ICSI  7)Blastocyst transfer  8)Heparin treatment  9)Beta test  &nbsp;  So there it is - 9 easy steps to an IVF cycle. The one thing that makes me the most nervous (besides the fear that it won't work) is the fact that I have a slight needle phobia. Of those 9 steps, 7 involve needles. At one point in the cycle, I will be giving myself 6 injections in one day. Yikes. This is going to be interesting.                 "
"                 Four years ago today, one of my best friends died. He was 23 years old,&nbsp;a victim of depression and alcoholism.  &nbsp;  I met&nbsp;him when I was 19, the summer after my freshman year of college. We instantly became friends, and after knowing each other for a few weeks we started dating. He was my first serious boyfriend, and it was with him that I learned all of those things you learn in your first adult relationship. We were decidedly amateurs when it came to communication, trust, and balancing time together and time apart. In a couple of months we went from planning our wedding to absolutely hating each other. I was convinced he was lying to me, and he was convinced I was lying to him. (We were both wrong.) After Christmas, I decided not to return to school for winter semester so I could have some space. On Valentine's Day we broke up.  &nbsp;  For over a year&nbsp;we had no contact. The next&nbsp;summer he came home, and because we attended the same church we inevitably ran into each other. After a few tentative and awkward conversations, we talked about what had gone wrong. We talked about our regrets, and we forgave each other for the hurt we had caused. We developed a friendship that was far more understanding and open than our&nbsp;romantic relationship had ever been. He called me for advice about his new girlfriend, we played our guitars together, he taught me how to make pesto. When I decided to go on a mission to France, he was my biggest supporter, and one of the last friends I hugged good-bye.  &nbsp;  There's a lot I don't know about what happened in the next several months. I was working hard&nbsp;and going through some enormous challenges on my mission.&nbsp;He and his parents wrote me encouraging letters, and I assumed everything was fine and that he would be around when I got home.  &nbsp;  It wasn't. And he wasn't.  &nbsp;  In the four years that have passed, I've learned a lot. I've&nbsp;learned to forgive myself for being so caught up in my own life. For&nbsp;being unaware of&nbsp;the absolute hell he must&nbsp;have been living in.&nbsp;For being powerless to help in any way that mattered. I'm grateful for the time we spent together before I left for France and that I got a chance&nbsp;to say the things I said. Not everyone gets that chance.  &nbsp;  Most of all, I'm grateful for the peace I have found in my life. I am so blessed with a wonderful husband who is the best friend I could ever ask&nbsp;for, and who makes my&nbsp;life more spectacularly happy&nbsp;than I had ever imagined it would be. I strongly believe that we go on after death, and so I like to think that somehow, my old friend is looking down on me and wishing me well.&nbsp;   So today, on&nbsp;the anniversary of a terrible event, I remember&nbsp;all that he taught me, and I thank him.

"                 My husband Alverice* came home from work today and found me lying on our bed in a fetal position, moaning and cursing the day I was born. Naturally, he thought I was dying. Then he saw the heating pad and the bottle of oxycodone and realized that I was just having period-induced cramps.  &nbsp;  Three weeks ago I had a laparoscopy to investigate my innards, specifically the innards that are related to producing babies. My RE (Reproductve Endocrinologist, AKA Really Expensive fertility doctor)&nbsp;found endometriosis on my ovary, bowel, and the back of my uterus - in endometriosis land, what they call the cul-de-sac. Because of the torture I endure every month, I was not surprised with my diagnosis. In a way it helps to know what's causing the pain and to know that I am not a hypochondriac. There's a cause for what I feel. So I'm glad I have some sort of explanation.  &nbsp;  Dr. Ambrosine* removed all the endo she could, using a laser (or possibly a light sabre), and also scraped some polyps out of my poor battered uterus. She warned me that my next period would be a doozy. She wasn't lying.  &nbsp;  I've never been more grateful for percocet.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *all names in my blog have been changed (using the  urlLink Mormon Name Generator ) to protect the innocent.

"                 Since graduating from college last year, one of the greatest pleasures I have discovered is reading. That may sound odd, considering that I was an English major and did nothing but read (and write about what I read) for a good four years. The difference is, now I can read whatever I want to, and I can do it at my own pace. I've re-read a lot of the books I had read hurriedly for classes and discovered new ideas I missed the first time. I've re-read the entire works of Orson Scott Card and was reminded of why I fell in love with his writing at the age of 13. Yesterday on my way to take a bath (ah, the luxury of my life!) I picked up my copy of  The Red Tent  by Anita Diamant. I enjoyed it the first time I read it several years ago, and this time it took hold of me so completely that I didn't even notice the bath water growing cold around me until my cat jumped up onto the side of the tub and peered down at me like I was crazy.   The Red Tent  is a fictional retelling of Genesis 34, the story of Dinah the daughter of Jacob. Following the Jewish tradition of midrash, Diamant makes Dinah the narrator of her own story. In a simple but poetic voice, Dinah recounts the history of her family. Some aspects are familiar - the jealousy between Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wrestling with the angel, the sons of Jacob slaughtering the men of Shechem.  The difference is Dinah's voice. She speaks to the reader as if to a friend sitting in the same room. 'We have been lost to each other for so long,' she says in the prologue. 'My name means nothing to you. My memory is dust. This is not your fault, or mine. The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing.' The heart of her story is in the traditions of her mothers, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. She tells about the work of their daily life: gardening, tending animals, cooking, spinning wool, carrying water, making beer. At a young age she becomes a midwife and learns how to use herbs, incantations, and birthing bricks to help mothers deliver their babies.  She also describes the religious traditions of the women, which were completely separate from those of the men. Long before the revelation of the ten commandments and the injunction to 'have no other gods before me,' Diamant speculates that the women likely worshipped a pantheon of goddesses. Some of those mentioned are Gula, goddess of healing, Taweret, goddess of maternity and childbirth, and Innana, the Great Mother and the Queen of Heaven.  The center of the women's spiritual lives is the red tent, the place where they gather together to separate themselves from the men while menstruating or giving birth. Far from being a punishment for impurity, this was a time of rejoicing and celebrating life; as Leah puts it, 'In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleansing the body of the last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks -- for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes from between our legs, and that life costs blood.'  The women's lives revolve around fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth. The first time I read the story, I was fascinated by this at an intellectual level. Diamant provides many details about the herbs the women used for contraception, the prayers they uttered to induce labor, and the lengths they went to in order to achieve pregnancy. I guess it shouldn't have surprised me that this time, my interest was much more personal. I cried as I read the story of Rachel, who was infertile for many years before finally conceiving. 'Rachel could not smile at her sister while her own body remained fruitless. She was often away from the family's tents, seeking the counsel of Inna, who had a seemingly endless list of concoctions and strategies to open her womb. Rachel tried every remedy, every potion, every rumored cure. She wore only red and yellow -- the colors of life's blood and the talisman for healthy menstruation. She slept with her belly against trees said to be sacred to local goddesses. Whenever she saw running water, she lay down in it, hoping for the life of the river to inspire life within her ... But all these things did nothing for Rachel's womb.'  I relate to her feelings of desperation, to her willingness to try anything. That's the same thing I feel as I give myself shots each day and go to seeminlgy endless doctors appointments. And I count myself lucky that I was born in a time when effective treatments are available to me.  But there is something they had then that is missing now. Inside the red tent, the women care for one another and remind each other of the miracle of their bodies. While giving birth, the woman in labor is held up on three sides by her sisters while a midwife catches the baby. After the baby is born, they all care for the newborn and the mother until she is well enough to resume her normal life. The world we live in now is very different. Fertility treatments are not discussed openly, and are often kept a secret. Women give birth in hospitals with a husband and often no other women in the room. When she goes home with a new baby, she does it alone, unless she is lucky enough to have a mother who lives near by who can help. We live our lives largely separate from the support of other women. And at this particular time in my life, I grieve that loss.  Dinah speaks from the past, reminding us of the stories that are missing and urging us to remember them. 'And now you come to me -- women with hands and feet soft as a queen's, with more cooking pots than you need, so safe in childbed and so free with your tongues. You come hungry for the story that was lost. You crave words to fill the great silence that swallowed me, my mothers, and my grandmothers before them...It is terrible how much has been forgotten, which is why, I suppose, remembering seems a holy thing.' At the end of the book, Dinah leaves us with a promise that if we remember her story we won't be alone. 'Blessings on your eyes and on your children. Blessings on the ground beneath you. Wherever you walk, I go with you.'              "
"                 I've been taking Lupron for seven days now. So far it's gone well. The worst side effect has been the headaches. They start every day at around 2 in the afternoon and grow steadily worse until I go to bed. I'm very lucky that I don't have to deal with stress from work or school. I can lie down whenever I need to, do yoga, cook, and just focus on getting through this cycle.  The part I was most worried about - actually giving myself the injections - in reality has been the easiest. The first time I did it I sat there with the syringe pointed at my belly for 10 minutes before I finally got up the courage to plunge it in. I did it - and all I could think was, 'Is that it?' The Lupron needle is so tiny that I barely feel it going in. The medication itself does sting for a while afterwards, but it's nothing terrible and I feel much better now about the prospect of giving myself heparin injections for nine months if I am lucky enough to become pregnant.  Other than the headaches, the only thing I can complain about is the mood swings. And really, Alverice should be the one to complain about that. For a while he was puzzled every time I'd have an uncharacteristic outburst, but now he seems to be catching on to the fact that I'm going to be crazy as a loon for the next little while. He's been absolutely marvelous.  I have a tentative calendar for how this cycle will go. Come on and follow the bouncing fertility ball with me!   Phase One: Ovarian Suppression   August 4-13  Lupron 10 units daily; Dexamethasone .5 mg daily     Phase Two: Ovulation Induction   August 14-24  Gonal-F 2 vials daily, Repronex 1 vial daily; Lupron 5 units daily; Doxycycline 100 mg daily (Alverice will take this as well to prepare his sperm for ICSI); baby aspirin therapy I'll be closely monitored during ovulation induction with daily visits to the RE for blood draws and ultrasounds.     Phase Three: Egg retrieval   August 25  I'll be under general anesthesia (hallelujah!) while the doctor aspirates multiple eggs from my ovaries using a long needle. Begin progesterone-in-oil injections; begin heparin injections. Alverice will give a sample of his sperm the same day, and the lab fairies will combine a few of the good swimmers with a few of my eggs through ICSI (a procedure that has only existed for a few years in which a single sperm is injected with a needle directly into the egg. It is used in cases of severe male factor.)     Phase Four: Embryo Transfer   August 28-30  Depending on how well they develop, up to 3 embryos will be transferred into my uterus either 3 or 5 days after they are created in the lab. Continue progesterone-in-oil and heparin injections.   Phase Five: Beta Test   September ?  This is where we find out if it worked or not. If it did, I'll continue PIO and heparin shots; if not, we'll decide whether to go straight on to attempt #2 or take a break.  The really scary part is that anywhere along the way the whole thing could fall to pieces. I could be a poor responder and not produce enough eggs. I could produce  too  many eggs and develop OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome) which can be very dangerous and result in a cancelled cycle. Our embryos could fail to thrive in the lab. Or they could simply fail to implant after the transfer. As straightforward as the process seems to be, there is so much that could go wrong. Our chances of success are about as good as they possibly can be, but I'm doing my best to prepare myself for disappointment. I'm assuming we'll have to do this several times before succeeding. That way if it happens on the first try, I'll be pleasantly surprised.              "
"                 Today is the official start of IVF/ICSI cycle number one. Yesterday I had a hysteroscopy to follow up on the D&C I had during my lap in June. They removed several polyps, and before we begin the IVF process we had to make sure those hadn't resurrected themselves. My first hysteroscopy was last October, and it was a breeze. I actually enjoyed it because the nurse turned the TV screen so that I could see the images they captured of inside my uterus. This time...all I can say is  holy frijoles ! As soon as the hysteroscope was in I had cramping like I've never experienced before (and I have endometriosis!) I think my innards were still sore from the lap/D&C because every time Dr. Ambrosine moved the instrument it felt like she was stabbing me from the inside. Luckily the whole procedure was over in about 5 minutes.  Today I had my baseline ultrasound (date with Mr. Dildocam) to see if the birth control pills have suppressed my ovaries enough. They have, so Dr. Ambrosine gave me the green light to begin Lupron injections tonight. That is, assuming my meds arrive today. They were supposed to come yesterday but there was a mix-up in shipping at Freedom Drug. The last person I spoke to assured me that I would receive them between 8:00 and 3:00 today, but it's now after 2 and there's no FedEx guy in sight. So we'll see what happens. I'm more than a little nervous about injecting myself; I'm trying to be a grown-up about it and mostly succeeding by forcing myself to think about other things.  The most surreal part of today's appointment was making out the check to the fertility center. We're participating in their shared-risk program, in which they require you to pay the full amount for 6 cycles up front. I won't shock you by mentioning amounts, but let's just say it'll be a long, long time before I write a check that large again!              "
"                 Well, I promised to return with great tales of familial dysfunction, and I am as good as my word.  On our way to the Outer Banks we stopped off in Williamsburg to have a short visit with my grandmother. We have a cute nickname for her which all the grandkids use, but after this trip I think I’ll have to come up with a more descriptive name to call her. (Not to her face, of course.) Within minutes of being in her presence, she looked discerningly at Alverice and me and said, “Hmm, both of you have put on quite a bit of weight.” Now, after knowing her for 26 years I’ve come to expect her to be downright bitchy most of the time, but somehow it still shocks me when she says things like that. “Thanks for noticing,” was the best response I could come up with. A few minutes later when A and I had left the room my dad (who has been under a great deal of professional stress lately and is literally on the verge of a breakdown) took his mother aside and sternly told her she had been rude and demanded that she apologize to us. She refused, then asked my sister Keegan, “Were you raised to disrespect your elders?” A few minutes later we left, and our vacation was off to a joyful start.  The week at the beach was actually rather uneventful this year, which is a good thing. Because of my dad’s emotional state, my parents decided to rent their own house separate from the rest of the extended family. This turned out to be a great move; most of the drama usually involves one of my uncles saying something inflammatory and my dad freaking out about it. This year he could just go over to his own house when he started getting annoyed. Also, because everyone was aware he’s having a hard time, there was much less provocation than there has been in years past. My uncles are the kind of people who like to “stir the pot,” so to speak, and they don’t normally have the sense or the emotional maturity to know when to quit. So it was encouraging to see that they’ve learned how to keep quiet, if only for a few days at a time.  I think the best part was hanging out with my cousins. There are 12 of us, and we only see each other once or twice a year. I had a great time sitting in the hot tub late at night talking with Chalissa and Rehanna, who are 16 and 17 and both getting ready to apply to college. Every time I see them I’m shocked at how much they’ve grown, and impressed with the wonderful people they’re becoming.  Another fun part was that Paradise, my aunt by marriage to my uncle Benteen, brought her mother Audeanne along. It was nice to have a grandmotherly person there, especially since Audeanne is the exact opposite of my own grandmother in every way and is one of the sweetest women in the country.  On Thursday night at dinner all of us remarked that the week had gone exceptionally well. The weather was perfect, the water was warm, we ate amazing food every day, and we were all getting along. In retrospect, we really should have seen it coming. On Friday morning my uncle Arville and my dad had a run-in about what to do for dinner that night. I won't get into detail because frankly it's extremely silly and boring. Suffice it to say, words were exchanged. That evening we all went to see  The Village  (which I loved) and back at the house we all sat in the living room having a nice discussion about the film’s meaning. I wasn’t in the room when it happened, but apparently Arville said something that provoked my dad in just the right way and a nasty, nasty argument promptly ensued. It ended with my parents back at their own house and my uncle fuming at ours until late at night when he seemed to calm down a bit after sitting out on the deck by himself and coming back with an oddly grassy smell.  On Saturday morning they apologized and everything was OK again. Just in time for Alverice and me to head back home.  So to summarize, we had a good time, and we are now more tired, tan, and fat than we were when we left. Long live the family reunion.              "

"             Even though I am exhausted after today, I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep. My sister freakin disgusts me. I'm completely serious. Those who've kept up to date with my family drama knows what she's like, but it's like she gets more disrespectful towards my parents, me, whomever, every day. And the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh** astounds me. KICK HER OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HOUSE!! I'm sorry, she no longer has gas money to get to/from work until her next payday because she's giving it to her deadbeat, no job, I-scam-my-own-kid-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-work boyfriend. Make her walk to work Dad, take the bus, whatever. MAKE HER GROW UP!! Stop bailing her out, literally, figuratively, you name it. Just stop. Stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers, stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch, stop letting her order beer with dinner after two DUI's, stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him. STOP ENABLING HER! I'm beyond angry at her now-- there's no point anymore. She is and will probably always be a me-me-me person, and the way she treats my parents, she can frankly go to hell at this point. But the fact that my parents keep taking it over and over, saying that they're finally going to draw the line and enforce rules but then get lazy about following up with it, I'm about ready to distance myself from all of them. If your own lives, household, health, or sanity isn't worth fighting for, nothing I can try to say anymore is going to change your minds. You pretend to listen, but apparently I'm the only one who feels your existence is worth it. Kick her out, for the love of god, and let her finally live with the consequences of her dumbass decisions. She's freakin 24; she'll learn to deal.  My God! Are there any non-dysfunctional families out there anymore, seriously???  Okay, I'm done now. Really can't wait for the holidays now....            "
"              Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards. In an attempt to do so, however, we discovered the true meaning of hell on earth as we know it. This hell is otherwise known as U Village. You may be familiar with it, what with its trendy, overpriced department stores and coffee shops, orange-fleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduation-gift Lexuses with their pristine Ugg boots. Hell. We honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits. Parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they, after all,  do  have the right of way. Stay at home moms in trendy Touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot, no matter how long the line behind her was. HELL!    It all connects to a bigger picture to me, the things that rank high on my pet peeve list. It's why I hate leaving home on weekends. The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God! I hope people don't mind more internet shopping this year; I fear that with my lowering tolerance and increasing road rage that my braking foot might fail at a very inopportune time for you, dear affluent family with your triple-seated stroller walking down the very center of the road without any regard of my approaching bumper right on your Tevas. Come now, would it really be such a shame to have one less of you out there? I thought not.           "
"             Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much, it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world. For those who do learn of my existence here, expect nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing. You should know by now that I am a quiet one, not as politically savvy as the men-folk in my life, opinionated still but just choose to keep it to myself more often than not. So here goes, some inner thoughts.  I just read some of Foutsy's previous postings, and I have to say it, he's an outright liar.  When referring to the 4th's fireworks display, he states that he's 'just not as impressed with big flashy things.'  And yet not a single other person could outjump him or squeal louder than his shrill soprano voice could at Tim's bachelor party.  All of the other men had fallen silent at the sight of the groom-to-be's scrotal bling, but not the Fouts.  It was blinding and it was magnificent.  I like boobs. Most of you do too, admit it. They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun.  Picture two octopi rubberbanded together, and poke.   Neato.  Last night the kids and I went to a local eating establishment and met Tim's new coworker, Gina.  Sweet girl, funny, outgoing, cute for a borderline midget.  I, however, hope that we can use young Gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name.  Run and hide,  Tora   Teenus , for you shall have no peace once you are found.          "

"             What goes bzzzzz bzzzzz silence ouch!  me being stung by a wasp.  Yes an angry brute declared me lunch today at work, and now I've got a hand the size of a baseball glove.  (okay, it's not that bad or I wouldn't be able to type, but there is a pretty nice swollen lump on the back of my right hand that doesn't want to go away despite repeated icings).  I had to call first aid so some one could bring me up some 'sting stop', which didn't really help that much anyway, and the guy had to fill out all this paper work, just for one little sting.  But I guess for insurence purposes...  I kept working anyway, although it was hard to serve ice creams because I was trying not to bend my hand.  I guess the sting was payback for the many wasps I've sacrificed to hot water for the common good (and our sanity up at the Soda Fountain!) but I think I would have rather slammed my finger in the door - oh wait, I did that too!  Not having much luck with my hands today...  at least I'm about to sleep so I can endanger them with knives and other potentially hazardous items.  Words of Wisdom:  stay away from wasps drunk on sugar, and angry because you've just tried to drown them in really hot water, and when shutting doors behind you, hold firmly to the handle.  That's all for now. :)   p.s. I'm really not a bad person, I only killed those wasps because they were a danger to us and the visitors, and our (by us and ours I mean me and my coworkers) mental health - have you tried to pour a pop with five angry wasps buzzing around your head and hands?  not a fun activity!)

"             Whew!  While moving upstairs has been great because we don't have to repack and then unpack everything, it's a little like a bloody 5-day marathon! Okay, we've only been moving stuff up since monday, and it's been up and down those freaking stairs I don't know how many times with books shelves and beds and laundry baskets full of plates and food and blenders and more!  Not to mention that my previous bedroom now looks like a closet threw up on it - clothes everywhere.  I am definately going to have to do some weeding in that department because I don't think i can fit them all in my 'quaint' new closetless bedroom.   And I still can't decide which door to leave and which one to put my bookshelf in front - the door leading to the kitchen (closer to the food and the bathroom), or the one leading to the living room (potentially a quieter way, closer to the front door) ...  any suggestions?  I am still enjoying my colour choice, and the few pictures I have put up go very well with it. (yay)  But it's late and I have to work, again, early...  so goodnight           "
"             Yay!!! Who gets to move upstairs today??? We do! Yep, we just did the 'walk around' with our landlady and now the floor is ours (and by floor i mean the main suite of the house). We're pretty excited, and danced down the stairs. It's time to start packing and hauling stuff up to our new abode. Wahoo!          "
"             Horray for having the same days off as my roomates, finally! today was splendid - we started our morning with blackberry infused pancakes (need i say yum?) and then headed out to the Sooke Potholes, a 45min drive and 20 min hike away. It was glorious - the water was cool, but oh so refreshing, and when we came upon Crystal's favourite swimming spot, there was not a soul in sight... soooo nice, just us, the sunshine, and the water. But then, 2 minutes later a rather large group of people ambled down the path... sigh, so much for solitude - but what can you expect from such a divine swimming place? After swimming up the river aways and watching some boys jump off cliffs into the water (yikes - i just keep picturing my cousin with his lacerated spleen from landing badly off a 30 foot cliff a couple weeks ago), we swam back an prepared ourselves for some much needed sunbathing. (well that only lasted for a little while until we had to break open the food bag and munch for a while - mmmm more good food like samosas and veggies and trail mix, and crystal's homemade candied ginger, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies!) It was a wicked way to spend the day. When we arrived home, it was time to check out some of the summer olympics - rowing and gymnastics to be specific (those gymnists can do some crazy shit i tell you). Then my good friend Oona came over and we got ready to go dancing at Steamers Pub where Velvet plays dance music with some funk every sunday night. Good times were had. All in all I'd have to say it was a pretty stellar day, obviously (sorry, but that's been the word of the day). :) But sweet dreams are awaiting me, and my eyelids are going on strike.... p.s. Happy Birthday Grandma!          "
"             early morning delights: Arriving at work for 7:30 or 8:00 am rarely has any perks (besides that of getting off by 4 or 4:30), except on those glorious days where I get to ice the cinnamon buns.  Yes, spreading soft cream cheese icing on still warm, gooey, sweet buns, and then swirling it with my fingers (gloved of course) to make it look simply irrisistable, is one of my favourite jobs.  The funny part is that I don't even like cream cheese icing, and our cinnmon buns are made with corn syrup, not honey, so they're way to sweet.  But making food look asthetically pleasing is something I love to do...  perhaps I should go into the culinary arts?  I think I'd probably have to expand my tastebud tolerance if i were to do that because I could make everything, but then I wouldn't be able to tell if it was good because I would probably dislike most of the ingredients I put in it...   sigh...  I'm working on it.  My roomate Crystal provides tough love when it comes to trying new things so I've now aquired a taste for previously untouchable items (according to me) like peppers (although I mostly like the orange and yellow ones), lentils, zucchini, spanikopita, and soy milk.  I'm sure most of you are shaking your head at me right now, but at least I'm trying right? :)  However, I think that tomatoes are always going to be on my ewww list - I've tried to eat them, but there's just something about the combination of juicyness/watery flavour/peel texture that I can't deal with.  But I was supposed to be giving an ode to cinnamon buns.  Now, if you want to treat yourself to a truly divine example of what a cinnamon bun can be, you should take yourself over to the Kooteney Bakery Cafe in Nelson, BC (a long treck for some of you I realize, but I'll put it out there anyway) where my dad makes a delectable pecan cinnamon bun with a buttercream icing.  And so I shall leave you with that scrumptous vision.  I think I'm drooling a little... ;)          "

"             People who can hack being in the front row of a concert shouldn't be there in the first place! Ah Matthew Good, a great show, a great band, a great location, and a stupid audience - what else is new. This is not to say that I didn't throughly enjoy both the opening act, Wil, and Matt Good, they were amazing - especially from our hard won front row spots, but why do people think that shoving as hard as they can the people in front and to the side of them is going to make anyone's experience any better? I seriously had to elbow this guy a few times because he kept pushing up against me, and believe me, I wasn't planning on moving anywhere - we were about as close as you could get without being on stage. I understand that with a rock crowd in a bar, there's expected to be a little pushing and such, but three people body surfing in a not so large venue, come on now that's just a little ridiculous. I think that the aggressive side of me comes out when placed in those sorts of situations, I was just as ready to shove back, and I don't think that me and Tara moved more than a couple of inches the whole night. I certaintly wouldn't want to be a security person at one of those things! When it started getting rowdy, the girl next to me started freaking out a little, and I thought she was going to throw up, so we had to let her out - the security guys were pretty good at making sure the smaller people were doing okay (not that they asked us - we must have looked pretty determined). But I'm ranting. The music was great, he played mostly from his new album and a couple well chosen older songs like 'Picture Yourself' (forgive me if I have the title wrong...). And at the end me and Tara managed to pick up one of the set lists and a drumstick (yes, it's a little obsessive, but fun nonetheless) which we got signed by the man himself! Tara was tempted to stalk him back to his hotel, but we decided that would be way too creepy as the streets were fairly deserted and he was walking with two body/security guards... I swear that we're not that obsessed (disclaimer - I was mostly following Tara... really...). One girl asked to have Matt's half finished glass of beer and she got it! ewww, what would you do with that? What ever tickles your fancy I guess (well, not like I can do much with a drumstick, but at least it's keepable). Anyway, if you're a Matthew Good fan, I highly recommend you see him live, but just be prepared to stand your ground if your in the throng.          "
"             Well, upon contemplation, neither previously mentioned colours fit, and so I ended up with a light green titled 'spring fest'. Me and my roomate then proceeded to apply said paint to the wall at 9:30pm - not bothering with a coat of primer to help cover the dark purple currently covering the walls of my soon to be bedroom. Needless to say, we were tired, the purple showed through, and I realized how small this room really is. It shall be me, and my bed, and then the walls. Okay, it's not that bad, but it's definately the smallest room I've ever inhabited before! (It does, however, have nice big windows, a cool built in cupboard, and a funky old light fixture - having been designed as the dinning room). The colour is bright, but I think once I get everything in place it will be a happy medium.  I think that the idea of painting and choosing colours and decorating etc is always more exciting than the actual hard labour (big surprise there), and I am happy it's finished.  one more week and then we can be moving upstairs!  Yay for hardwood floors, a plethora of cupboards and shelves, a fireplace, and our own mailbox!  I'm planning on having a 'moving up' party around then, so anyone living nearby who wants a nice dinner for the price of carrying a few items up the stairs, please give me a call. ;)  Well, it's time to remove the tape from the walls of my affectionately dubbed 'medicine cabinet' room, here's hopeing no paint bled through!          "
"             i've discovered the joy of blogs.  blog blog blog. If only I could remember all the great things I wanted to write about...  Today my biggest problem was choosing a colour to paint my room, I'm waffling between 'windy hill' and 'tropical mango'  any suggestions?  (windy hill is a lighte bluey colour).           "

"                  Negative energy, don't we all have some of this within? I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us. Is there a way to completely block it out and if so will it make me a happier person. You see, I am a fairly happy person. I enjoy laughing and being silly and letting the inner child in me come out to play every so often.      So last night I and a few friends were having a little get together. Ya know some jokes a few bottles of wine couple hands of cards. The usual. Well I had heard this news story on the radio earlier in the day that just made me think....wow....Weird. Crazy. So let me enlighten you guys on this rather odd and extremely disgusting news tidbit that fell into my lap while driving.         In some state that I'm unsure of last week there was a dentist who had his license taken away from him for injecting his 'happy juice' into the mouths of his un-suspecting patients, telling them it was a dental rinse, and then asking them to swallow it. Well, apparently a few of the poor women this happened to knew what it was they had just tasted and got together and sued him. Upon a search of the dentists office they found several syringes in his desk drawer full of said 'happy juice'. YUCK!      Ok so the point to that was... my boyfriend walked in the room where me and my friends were all hanging out after he had come out of the bathroom and wiped his wet hand on me. Triggering me to think 'ewwww he just wiped pee on me' which then triggered me to think of the news story I had heard earlier cause it has to do with bodily fluids. So I tell my friends the story, mainly to gross them out as it did me. Then this guy, we will call him John. ( not my friend) starts telling me what a negative person I am and how he doesn't even listen to things like that because he doesn't allow negative energy to consume him. Okay, I am thinking John is a complete fucking moron. I was just sharing a news story. Then he goes into how he has this forcefield around him that no negativity can withstand. To quote him ' It would be like a spitball hitting an airplane.' What the fuck, dude??? By this point everyone is confused now and they all we all just keep saying, Huh? Huh? What? I'm confused.      Sometimes I just do not understand where people are coming from. Maybe someone reading this will understand where he was coming from. If so let me know. Until next time---        "
"                 I would like to start out with a little explanation as to who I am and why I have created this little corner of my world. Although, I feel like who I am will probably reveal itself to you readers through these blogs more than I could ever explain. So on to why I have created this blog then shall we? I stubbled across this the other day while 'taking a little break' from work. You see I always read the Real World/Road Rules Blog spot. I just love both of those shows, it truely is an obbsesion. So somehow I ended up here and I thought to myself; this would be a neat thing to do. I can truley express real feelings on all kinds of subjects and the worse thing that will happen is no one will read it. Not so bad. I also could use the typing practice and learn a little more about my computer, also. So I am going to learn as I go, hopefully I wont do too bad. I do feel like I should tell a little basic history about myself though so here it is. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama where I grew up living a twisted version of a somewhat normal life until I was 16. At that age I got married ( yes I know 'married at 16, lives in Alabama' I am not that stereotype. Though I do meet all the qualifications!) and stayed married until I was 19 and living in Tampa, Florida. I left my husband and came home to Alabama. Then I met someone and left for Cleveland, Ohio, where I resided for three years and returned back to Alabama at the age of 21. For the past five years I have been living with my boyfriend in our house here in Alabama. I have had all types of jobs and many reasons for the choices I have made. Some not very good ones I will have to admit. However, I would not change a thing. I am mostly happy with the person I am today and where I am at. I do fight inner-battles constanty it seems and struggle with the state of the world and the people in it among many other things. I do not want to overwhelm anyone so thats where Im stopping for today. Till next time------        "

"       Well, I've finally taken to reading other people's blogs and I've found that diving into the minds and lives of others can be quite refreshing.  I have also recently reviewed one of those internet profiles of a friend I thought I knew.  Apparently, I never even knew his real name and have been calling him by an alias all these years (yeah right).  His profile describes someone only vaguely like the man I thought I knew.  It's like finding out your husband is a secret agent for the CIA after 15 years of marriage - you saw the movie.    Anyway, as I am terminally honest in all aspects - even internet life (perish the thought) I find it extremely funny that we feel that we need to embellish online.  The internet has provided us with endless opportunities to communicate with our friends & loved ones, to express our ideas and beliefs, and to meet that hottie we've always dreamed of.  Trouble is, once you meet face to face you discover that you prefer the online fantasy to reality.  Oh, and I immediately deleted all quotes and quibbles from MY profile - no one would ever believe anyone is that perfect... they'd just assume embellishment. ;)          "
"        More Ying & Yang  Reviewing my last entry, I realize that I only gave one ying & yang example.  I could give more, like how great it is that my youngest daughter is home after living with her grandmother for the past three months.  It's great having her back where she belongs, but it's not great waking up three times in the night - bottle break, potty break and day break.  She was up at 6:45 am saying 'Mommy, its a little bit morning, time to wake up!'    Gotta take the good with the bad, right?    And have another cup of coffee to get me through the day.           "
"       As I burned my tongue on my oatmeal this morning, I started thinking about how my life has lately been a pure example of ying & yang; a complete balance of good & bad.  Examples being first of all, I had to cancel a very chi-chi dinner I had planned to include a 5 course meal under a full miami moon, oceanside with 4 french wines to accompany the meal.  Masquerade, gourmet cuisine, great people - to say the least I was extremely dissapointed in what, to me, represented complete and utter failure on my part.  But then, on the day of the cancelled dinner, someone handed me an article extolling another, past event that I put together.  The writer, bless him, described the event as cozy and refreshing with the company of 'gentle folk'.  As, he described it exactly as I remember it - and I felt really good to know that someone else besides myself really enjoyed the fruits of my labor.  So I am once again reminded that you take the good with the bad.  Even when I am at my lowest point, it takes so little to bring me back to the sunny side of life.  Thanks, Mr. Dolen.          "
"       Day 2.  It's so exciting!  I realized last night, while pondering today's entry, that I have actually misnamed my blog.  What I meant to call it was 'Diva-lish Drivel'.  However, after looking up dribble in my webster's, I realize that Dribble is exactly what I meant to say.    After all, this will be a slow and steady flow of my thoughts and afterthoughts.  So, while it won't include anything about basketball (except maybe a word or two about the WNBA Miami Sol) it really will be dribble.  Besides, drivel is such an ugly word.           "
"       Hmm... a captive audience.  Where do I begin?  Welcome friends to my blog.  I'm very excited to have you here and hope I don't bore you to tears with my diva dribble.  Through this blog, you too can learn to be a diva ;)  So, day 1, page 1, paragraph 3.  Life on the internet begins and life as we know it is forever changed... or not.           "
"        Raise a glass  Last night I hosted my Wine Club.  Well, its not really MY Wine Club, I just come up with the theme then plan the event, write up the invites, mail the invites, coordinate with the wine suppliers, and manage the RSVP list.  Oh, and then I host the event.  I am the 'hostess with the mostess'!    Any way, last night I had high hopes of attracting over 75 people.  I was lead to believe that the suppliers had at least 60 confirmed reservations.  Suffice it to say that out of the 15 or so people there, none of them came from those 60 confirmed reservations.    Nonetheless, the wines were good - notice I used plural wines, as I did partake of more than one.  The event was a success in so much as those who attended were sophisticated and social.  Several groups of conversation developed and everyone mingled throughout the evening.   Did I mention that I did partake of plural wines? *grin*  I still have to say it... I love my  urlLink job!

"        Rock the Vote!  I received a very powerful e-mail this morning from a dear friend who has served in the Navy.  I'm sure he speaks for many of the men & women serving our country's military.  I'm not exactly pro-military but I certainly do value and appreciate the rights and freedom we enjoy because of their service.  So, without further ado...  Subject: right to vote!   Hey folks this is Jason. I am just sending out this little reminder that election time is almost upon us. This is a very important issue for me because i know a lot of people take our right to vote for granted. right now there are American troops fighting to protect what we have and many more (including yours truly) that have served in the military. please take the 15 minutes out of your day to register and another hour out of your day to actually vote. i would be very disappointed to find out some of you just didn't feel like it or were too busy. Imagine how bad you would feel if we didn't have that right at all.  Thanks,  Jason          "

"        Thank you, your honor!  I have finally had my 'day in court'; I think everyone should have one of these.  It's like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame, except mine took about a half hour.  Without going into all the sordid details, let me just say that the judge and state attorney were not impressed with my dead-beat-dad ex-husband (my, he's earned quite a title!) and they were NOT having any of his excuses.  Lesson to any dads out there considering not paying child support: no matter how hard you try to justify not giving the mom child support money - your ass is going to jail.  That wonderful humanitarian of a judge told him to show up next week 'with money or a toothbrush.'  She's giving him a chance to keep his sorry ass out of jail, while at the same time getting me a little of what I'm due...that's fair.  She's my hero!             "
"        More blogster diving goodness  While I am actually managing to get work done this Mundane, uh, Monday morning, I did click that fabulous little NextBlog button.  Its an addiction I have, I need caffeine and NextBlog every morning to get me going.  I don't know how that button works, or how it selects which blog to go to next, but today there was a sort of theme woven into the melange of goodies.  I found one blog totally devoted to the daily doses of medication and inevitable deterioration of one woman's 14 year old cat, as it dies from some form or another of cancer.    Then there was  urlLink Not my dog , which didn't mention anything about a dog.  She has a cat though, that kept her up all night recently.  Anyone who's ever hated their cat due to an all night howling session can relate.  And finally,  urlLink Jason's Blog , which didn't mention any animals at all, but has a picture of a dog's tongue hanging out of a huge gaping dog mouth.  All made for some good reading today.  This blog is turning into a blog journal of my blog travels.  Geez, have I no life of my own to blog?  Oh, wait - I went to a wine tasting on Saturday night.  There, I do have a life.  Of course, it was free, at a liquor store.  Not much more than a poorly disguised marketing ploy to sell liquor.  At least my events are social and entertaining - and you get more than a thimbleful of the stuff.  My event is next Thursday, can't wait to see how that goes.  Oh, crap its this Thursday... with only 5 RSVPs. *gasp*  Undaunted, I'm going to have a good time no matter how many people show!         "

Anyway, I am so proud of myself.  I have managed to dress up my page quite nicely today.  As we tour the page, you will notice in the upper left hand corner my new counter.  My pathetic hunger for recognition requires that I know exactly how many people have visited my page.  The down side to this is that this could end up like the little red 0 on my answering machine.  Screaming at me the blatant fact that NO ONE has called. *sigh*  Also, you will see the sexy little weather pixie, announcing the perfect tropical weather here in sunny South Florida.  From what I've seen, the tramp changes her outfits according to time of day, temperature and weather patterns.  Pretty clever.  And did I mention that she's looks just like me!  Then, just below the tramp -- I mean the weather pixie -- I've placed a Tag Board.  Here you can give me your thoughts, comments and other worthless... uh, that is...worthwhile input.

"        Tired, but smiling   Perched on a bar stool in a Moulin Rouge-like bar/restaurant, with drag queens and old queens milling and spilling all around me.  That is how I spent last night.  If you've never been to a drag show, let me assure you that you have not yet fully lived.    Went to a new place called Madame's last night and saw some of the most entertaining performers wearing more makeup than Tammy Faye - and looking good.  I especially liked the Bette Miller impersonator and the very large black, um, person - s/he really enjoyed singing and dancing on that little stage with the hot blinding stage lights and lively crowd pouring down on her.  My goddess friend Gloria left the bar moaning, 'I can't believe I sucked face with a gay man!'  And, according to her, he was 'very competent'.  He admitted that, while he prefers men, the last woman he slept with glued her phone number to his coffee table.  Competent indeed.  And all this on a school night, when I knew i had to get up in the morning but didn't really care.           "

And what could be more appropriate for us than to go to a dinner and cabaret show - drag queen style.  This should be a blast - I need a good laugh.  You know, the kind of laugh that shakes your whole body; the kind where the next day your stomach reprimands you for doing all those damned sit-ups but you were only laughing.  Laughing till your face hurts.  Then there's the meal that comes with the dinner, the great conversation and company of Gloria and the piece de resistance  *typed with a french accent*  -- this is a free meal.  There's no better dinner than a free dinner.  I'll have to put it all in my blog tomorrow.  BTW, if Andre Gide were around today, do you think he would he have written his 'Journal' via blog?

Oh, and another thing.  My extremely weird friend Fred Gerbilman - he's not rich enough to called eccentric - says I'm weird, which is why he loves me.  This is like the pot calling the kettle black.  He sends me some of the most bizarre links to sites ranging from mundane to profane.  But I'm the weird one.    I may have to start sharing some of the more bizarre sights/sites he sends me just to prove my point... And just to prove my point, *raising my hand with finger pointing triumphanly toward the sky* you can visit his Rant blog at  urlLink Gerbilman Rant  .    The fact that I've figured out how to add links to my page could really piss him off - this could have lots of entertainment value.         "

"       I wonder, does it make me a bad person because I'm enjoying putting the squeeze on my dead-beat-dad ex-husband?  After 10 months of no payments in child support, we're finally going to court at the end of this month.  He now has less than 2 weeks to come up with the dough he owes me or he'll sit in jail until he pays me.  I've had 2 years of struggle - of wondering how I'll pay the rent and the day care and still manage to buy food for my two children.  In the meantime, he's living in his girlfriend's house, driving her car, sleeping in her bed and eating her food.  OK, so maybe I'm a little bitter about the whole thing.  Maybe after he married me he finally realized that SHE is his one true love and he couldn't bear to live a lie by being married to me.  Or maybe he just got in too deep and needed her to bail him out.  Well, now she may have to do just that - literally.  (Although I really hope it doesn't come to that - I would prefer getting paid.)  Does it make me a bad person?  I just want to get paid.  And see him squirm just a little.   As for my two wonderful little girls - I must say that I got the better end of this whole divorce deal.  I have the pleasure of the company of two of the most beautiful and charming little girls I've ever known.  Never mind they're my children, they are two exceptional human beings.  Every day I get more and more joy from knowing them and seeing them grow.  There is nothing more valuable to me than one of their hugs, or seeing their faces light up when I pick them up from school or grandma's house.  I know that, in spite of all the struggle and hassle and frustration that comes from being a single mom with less than adequate support from an absentee father, having them in my life makes my life worthwhile and fulfilled.

"        Waxing Philosophical   Seems like I'm coming to an end of another chapter in my neverending novel of a life.  Well, actually it will end eventually - only I won't be around to comment on the final chapter.  It just feels like I've had a very rough two years, much of the drama created by my own actions of course.  And now, I'm reaching a very anti-climatic point in the story.  I can't say 'ending' because that's not what it is.  Any ending is really just another beginning.  And that's where I'm at - another beginning.  Opportunity disguised as loss - I take every loss as an opportunity for something else. I've had plenty of loss these past years and I just know that its time to forge ahead into some new beginning... but what?           "
"        Next Blog bringing the world closer together  Found another interesting blog today.  I love that Next Blog link; when I get bored at work I follow that link where ever it wants me to go.  Today, along with a really boring blog on handhelds and another one in portuguese, it took me to  urlLink  Mercury Frog   .  He's getting married in a few days, and apparently pondering the realities of grown up life.  Can't wait to hear about the big day.    Oh, and as for my cake-eating friend... apparently the bakery is closing down.           "
"       This will be the second time I'm trying to get this blog entry in.  Yesterday I discovered, much to my dismay, that there is another blog under the same name as mine.  Can you believe it?! Only, I've spelled it differently - her version is Diva - liscious.  You can check it out if you like - she's got an interesting life and pictures to prove it.  Go to  urlLink  Diva - liscious    And, now for a little self indulgence and pity.  I've decided that life isn't finished with me yet, and I apparently have more growing to do if I'm ever to be ready for real, soul-shaking soul-mate kind of love.  And if I hear one more time that I'm a nice girl, or a good girl I'm going to scream.  All that goodness and niceness is getting me nowhere in the romance department.  I mean, really - even the most horrid, ugly troll bitches get to have boyfriends and/or husbands.  Yes, I've had a husband but that one, apparently, didn't really count.    One of my friends has reminded me that anything worth having is worth waiting for.  Easy for him to say, now that he can have his cake and eat it too.   But enough of that.  Onward and upward - and hope springs eternal.  My horoscope insists that things are looking very good for August and I'm betting the bank on it!         "
"       Not going to dwell on what i've done... just forging ahead blindly into the possibilities. But there is hope, as he is thinking about me still.  I wanted to comment on a funny coincidence that has given me a strange perspective into a stranger's life.  a neighbor's life actually.  5 or 6 years ago, a guy tried to pick me up in a club.  He gave me his number but i left it at the bar and never called him.    I actually saw him at a few other places around town, always with a group of friends - apparently we liked the same places.  He didn't seem to remember or recognize me, and I never tried to say hello.  Now, it turns out that when I moved into my new apartment in January, I moved into HIS building.  We really do like the same places.  But being his neighbor has afforded me a greater insight into this man's life - and on a greater scale, I think into the lives of many people just like him. Young, professional, sufficiently successful, and single.  I know what car he drives - by seeing him parking in the garage one day.  I know he lives on the 23rd floor of my building, since we ride in the elevator together frequently.  He leaves for work at 8:30 and gets home around 7pm.  I've even seen him walking out of the 'gentleman's club' around the corner from our building.    And finally, I've seen him with maybe 2 different women - so i've seen his taste in women too.   It's strange and deep in my heart it makes me a little sad, because I see this man's solitary life and some of its private details.  I sometimes wonder how it feels to be him - solitary -- no children, no wife.  I wonder if he's happy living alone.  Maybe he has a pet, but I've never seen him walking a dog... a cat maybe?    So many of us walk together, live together and are so alone.  We think that no one knows our sorrow or cares; we are all looking for something more.    I've still never really said hello to him.  I have no interest in really getting to know him, although he may be a very nice person.  It may be cowardice, but I'm just happy knowing his secrets.  And in some small way this makes me feel more connected to the world as a whole - it reminds me that we are all the same, we come from the same source and we are all one.         "
"       Well, I've done the unthinkable.  I've opened up to contact with the one person who is both heaven & hell, wrapped up in one neat package.  Love and hate, together in a fiery passion... god I've missed him!  Still not sure what I was thinking when I ruined it all, or why I think I could ever fix what I f*cked up. But, onwards and upwards.  Maybe I'm just craving another escape to NY? Or maybe there really is a reason why I can't get him out of my head.  Let the ride begin...          "

You know how mercurial we gods can be ;)  I gave up, and he called. My divine Diva-ness proved irresistible.         "
"        Back in order...?   Well, I think I've got my page back in order.  If not, this may be as good as it gets for a while.   Just wanted to give thanks to my friends.  I was having one of those 'poor me' moments over the weekend.  Single mom, all alone with no one to talk to, yadda yadda yadda.  I am ashamed to admit that I was feeling very down - it was really quite pathetic if I do say so myself.  But - hey - even a diva can have a moment of weakness!  Then I opened up my e-mail this morning and was reminded once again that I do have friends - really good friends that love me.  They just live to damn far away to be hanging out on my sofa every weekend.  *sign*    But thanks for the little notes and nice thoughts that you send to me.  Just to say hello, or to give me a word of inspiration - all of those little things mean a lot to me - especially after the weekend that none of you could have possible known about.

Slept waaaay too much on Saturday and then refused to be such a sloth again on Sunday.  I actually cleaned my apartment, did some laundry and went food shopping.  Which, in mother-speak, translates into picked up so the kids can mess up, washed what will be dirty again and too small very soon, and spent money I didn't have on something that won't last more than a few days.

"        Cleaning House   First of all, thanks to Birth Control? for this fabulous offering.  If you love popping bubble wrap, I just know you're gonna dig this...  urlLink Virtual Bubble   Now, for the subject of the day... Cleaning House.  Has absolutely nothing to do with bubble wrap (although I did find some forgotten bubble wrap tucked away in a closet).  But that's besides the point.  For some odd reason, I don't do 'spring cleaning'.  The urge comes later in the year - right around now.  Or maybe its early; depends on how you look at it - half full, half empty.  So, the urge struck me Saturday and I struck back by spending about 6 hours clearing out cards, letters, old drawings from my kids, WEDDING GIFT CARDS.  Even found the bill from the hotel on the wedding night.  *sigh*    I got rid of 4 big bags of what used to be treasured memories.  Now they're just junk to load into the landfill.  And I can't tell you how gooooood it felt ripping up a few last straggling pictures of DBD.  Talk about cleaning house - that emotional closet is stripped bare now!    But I won't share too much here - just suffice it to say that I now have lots of happy memories stored away in all my little boxes that I love to collect.   And, I have empty boxes ready to collect all the happiness I have yet to create.  Diva out.         "

"        September 11th again  There's a lot in the media this morning about remembering this day.  Some people around me are down, others appear to not even know of the significance of today (although I suspect affected appearances).  Personally, I woke up with the radio reminding me of the sadness of this day, of the impact felt by families around the world and of the continued feeling that nothing has been done still.  A friend spoke to me of the families of the victims, and those of the firefighters and policemen lost in the attacks.  He wasn't concerned with how they've all managed to go on while mouring lost loved ones.  His point was that firefighter and police families have received $900,000 in financial relief while victims' families have 'only' recieved on average $100,000 in relief.  Something like that - my figures may be off.  He was disturbed at the unbalanced totals of money.  So, I'm wondering... why is it that a living family member has no dollar value.  You can't buy that loved one for any amount of money.  No decent mother would sell her child to someone (these days) no matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars you offered her.  Why is it, that once a family member is killed all of a sudden there is a dollar value placed on the life of that person?    I believe that the dollar value is not to replace the loss of that person - for no money can do that.  I think it has more to do with revenge - 'they're going to pay!'.  But, in the greater scope of things, that way of thinking is very base and has nothing to do with honoring the life and memory of the one lost.  It is hate and anger reacting and trying to take control of a situation over which we have no control.    It saddens me that the attacks happened and I do believe we should remember those that were lost and remember the hate that caused such actions.  Doing so may guide us all to a world where violence does not answer violence and knowledge erases hate and prejudice.    I am determined to have a good day and to be grateful for all that I have - even the challenges that cause me strife!    Diva out.         "
"        The key to happiness  I've discovered the key to sublime happiness.  It's butter.  A little sugar never hurt either.  But, note the butter to happiness ratio... the more butter, the happier you will be.    Stay with me on this.  Just think about the last stack of pancakes you had; lots of butter, right?  And didn't you feel soooo good after wolfing down the stack?  Or that warm, flaky biscuit that you dunked in butter at the dinner table.  Complete and utter bliss.    Personally, I had the most divine croissant *using your best french accent - say craa - san'* this morning.  Not only was there butter baked in, so much so that it left my fingers glistening with the magic stuff, but I went one step further and swathed it lovingly in even more butter.  Some may say adding the strawberry jam was going to far, but I say, 'You only live once!'          "
"        Thanks, I guess...  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I almost got what I wanted.  Had that all important follow up hearing after last week... you know, the one where he's supposed to show up with cash in hand.  What he showed up with was a letter explaining why he didn't have cash in hand.  And another pathetic excuse, which simplified, means his needs are far more important than those of his children.  The judge was fair, as before. She accepted his offer of $500 today - before 2pm.  Then she agreed to reduce the amounts due, but the total will still be $3000 to fulfill his 'purge'.  So, DBD (dead-beat-dad) now has a standing appointment before the Judge of the 11th Circuit County Court for the next 10 weeks.  Fortunately, I will not have to attend.  At first I was so angry that I really wanted to bitch slap him right where he sat.  Then I got over it, took control of myself and rationalized that $500 is better than nothing.  I'm getting paid and he's out of jail, earning more money to give to me.  It works.  So, thanks, I guess...         "

The Wine Club last night drew in 55 guests - most of them paying this time - for 'Get a Clue'.  Great wines, gourmet hors d'oeuvres and a terrific mix of people all made for such a great time.  There was a line at the wine bar last night - that was a first. And someone actually figured out the murder mystery and won a bottle of choice from our wine selection; she chose the Gallo(w), a very good choice.  After almost giving up on the whole thing, now I can't wait for next month's event.  I've selected Big Reds, and we may add a scavenger hunt to the evening.  Themes and games seem to draw a crowd.

I'm thinking the gray needs to go, as I have probably another 30 or 40 years to sport the gray hair.  And shorter may work too.  Although, I'm kind of digging the shoulder length do.  Hmmm.  10 pounds could go away and I wouldn't miss them at all.    Change is good.  New age, new year, new me.  We're still in the planning stages, so we'll see.   Diva out.         "
"        Update on demand  Congrats to Birth Control? for new baby steps!  Now the real fun begins (and more trips to the ER?).  I received an e-mail to please update my blog, so... I'm updating.  Went to a small but fun costume party at Debbie's on Saturday night.  Trying to figure out how to go to another party on Friday night.  I'll have to squeeze it into my busy schedule - this is the week of no free time!  Wednesday is the Wine Club event - 45 RSVP's  -  a record for the year.  Thursday is Halloween.  Kala will be a witch (again) and Leia has decided to be Jane from Tarzan instead of Princess Dot from Bug's Life.  Mom is undecided, but I have a sorceress costume from a friend.  Think evil step mother from Sleeping Beauty... oooh, maybe I'll just add a mirror as prop to the costume and that's who I'll be.    Friday I'm taking the girls - with Grandma too - to a halloween themed carnival.  And then there's the party an hour away.  Phil Berry is all grown up and having a party at his place (with roommate).  That should be interesting and hopefully amusing too.  Saturday is Hands on Miami Day.  Don't forget to click the little donate button (above left) to sponsor me if you haven't yet done so - thanks again Joe!  Saturday night is the Bug Ball, where I will be helping to pour wine for the party.  I'll be sampling a little of my own goods that night, for sure. *wink*  Sunday I'm going to try again to meet with friends for a Japanese tea ceremony - it keeps getting put off.  And somewhere in between I may actually get some sleep.  Loving life as a diva right now. *big grin*  Diva out.         "
"        A new friend  My girls don't get visitors at our house very often.  Once we had a pool party to celebrate the end of summer and four girls came over.  That was a lot of fun and it kept both of my girls entertained for the entire afternoon.  Last night we had another such special occasion.  Kala has teamed up for a pumpkin decorating project at school, so Jenny came home with us after school yesterday.  What a great time we all had decorating two pumpkins and turning it all into a jester with a miniature puppet of himself.  Kala and Jenny came up with the idea and I added my idea of the puppet.  Two pumpkins stacked on top of each other with a mini-me stuck onto a chopstick, jutting out from the bottom pumpkin.  It really turned out nicely.  What was the nicest of all though, was working with the girls to put it all together.  And then, having all three girls running around the house, chasing each other, blowing bubbles and creating general havoc.  We had such a good time together.  And on a school night!  Jenny was trying to convince her mother that she needed to sleep over Sunday night just so the two of them could carry the pumpkin into class together on Monday morning.  Mom wasn't buying it.    Kala has such nice friends; I hope she gets to come over and play again soon.  Diva out.         "

"        Three to fall down  3 1/2 actually.  I have decided to get Leia a helmet.  I believe that's the only way I'm going to preserve her tender little melon (her head) from serious damage.  She is constantly falling down, and its always on her head and/or face.  Its not because she's clumsy like her mother; she doesn't trip over her own feet or walk into walls.  Ok, sometimes she walks into walls, but that's another day's topic.  She bounces, she jumps... she FLIES.  She jumps on my bed, the sofa, the chair.  And sooner or later she lands on her head.  And she hasn't yet learned that jumping leads to falling.  Last night was a perfect example.    I didn't even see her standing on our particulary bouncy chaise lounge.  She must have done what she always does -- start at the head of the chair, bounce along the length of the lounge and then dive off the end of it onto a huge cushion on the floor.  It scares the hell out of me everytime I see it, but this time I didn't see it.  And this time she missed the cushion, flew right past it head first into the wall and the base of a tall wrought-iron candle holder.    When I find her, she's lying face down, like a little doll shoved into the corner with her head pushed too far to the left.  Miraculously, she was fine.  A little scared, no real damage done.  And then, once the boo-boo was all gone and she had calmed down, we had discussed not jumping on that chair anymore.  She agrees by saying, 'Ok, Mommy.  Let's go jump on your bed better.'  *sigh*   Either I'm going to have a vegetable for a daughter or she's strong enough to live through a nuclear holocaust.  Headgear is the only way to be sure.

"        Two to Tango   I have a new appreciation for the bandoleon.  It's like an accordian, only bigger and I guess somehow more noble.  It really does go very nicely with a piano, the Tango concert I went to taught me this.  Although, I have to say, watching the guy play the bandoleon was another form of entertainment.  Have you ever  seen  this?  It may be illegal to play this thing in public in some countries.    The musician sits on a chair, with the instrument resting on his lap.  As he moves the thing open and closed it makes a whining, yet pleasing sound.  It can be very gentle and quiet or really strong and loud.  And when it is played loud and long is when the visual entertainment begins.   As the instrument is stretched out to its limits, it becomes too much to hold on a closed lap.  Think Slinky stretched to its extreme - the center starts to droop.  To accommodate this, the player must o-p-e-n his legs w-i-d-e to support the instrument.  Then, add to that the passionate way in which he plays the sharp notes; moving with his whole body and sometimes pushing forward with his shoulders or hips.  The bandoleon singing or moaning and gasping for breath all the time.  No wonder Tango is so damn sexy... the dances were inspired by moves of the musicians!  It really was very exciting and a lesson in traditional music from Argentina and Uruguay.  Just another reason I love living in Miami.  All that culture.   Diva out.         "

"        this just in...  So, I have a little more to say today.  I have 2 free tickets to a Tango concert/performance tomorrow night and I was a little sad because I thought that I'd have to go alone, and as we all know, it takes two to tango.    I had asked a friend who I thought would be interested in going, but since I hadn't heard back I thought I was going alone... but he IS going with me!   I can get all dolled up and go out with a friend, a male friend.  It's almost like a real date and I couldn't be more pleased.   And, I'm hoping to meet some other friends for a Japanese tea ceremony on Sunday.  It never takes much to make me happy; an e-mail here, a phone call there.  Makes me a happy little Diva.    I'm looking forward to a wonderfully busy weekend, and I wish the same to all my friends!  Diva out!         "
"       Not much more to say today than HAPPY FRIDAY!  Did a little blog surfing yesterday, but for some reason the english-written blog channel was broken.  All I got were blogs in french and what I think may have been finnish... All I know is I couldn't read one damn word of it.  Another busy, busy day ahead of me, so I'm going for another cup of coffee and then bravely into the fray!  Diva out.         "
"        Tired but happy  I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had the equivalent of two weeks in one.  My office has been so busy I can't keep up or keep track of it all.  I've planned a Wine Club event and sent out 500 invitations (which includes printing the invites and the labels, stuffing, licking and running through the postage meter), done my director of sales' New York sales trip expense report twice, remembered National Boss Day (2 'bosses'), put out several little fires the past three days, booked reservations for several VIP guests (and those who think they're VIP) and even got the hotel to sponsor the wine for an upcoming party at the Miami Beach Botanical Garden.    And all of that has very little to do with my personal life, which by the way, I do actually have.  I'm exhausted.  But, I'm happier than I've been in weeks.  I've got something to do every Saturday for the next 3 weeks, and some Sunday's too.  I'm looking ahead to my birthday weekend and all the arrangements I need to do.  'God' called and wants to spend my birthday with me, and its always nice spending time with him.  I'm getting more involved in volunteering and in the baby's daycare.  I'm having little bedside chats with Kala more often - real mom-daughter bonding time.  And, I'm reconnecting with some of my dearest friends that I have lost track of.  And lets not even mention all the holidays that are coming up.  I'm exhausted, but I'm happy.  Busy is good.    Diva out.         "
"        The Glamorous Life?   I live in Downtown Miami, in the lap of luxury... on the 25th floor with a balcony overlooking Miami and the Beaches.  I have a f-a-a-a-a-bulous view of Biscayne Bay and the Ocean -- way over there on the horizon.  Miami is beautiful and draws all the beautiful people.  Movies are made, videos are shot and we are all dripping with glamour.  There are advantages to being a Downtown Diva.  With that in mind, let me tell you about last Friday night.  A production company has been filming 'Fast and Furious 2' for months now, in and around Miami.  They've been filming in my 'hood for the past few weeks.  Yes, glamorous.  Glitzy and fabulous.  Haven't actually seen that yummy Diesel guy, but he's hangin' in my 'hood for filming.    And, last Friday they were filming until the wee hours of the morning - actually they didn't even start until 11pm.  How do I know this, you ask?  I know this because that's when I was going to sleep - or at least I thought I was.  At about 11:30, while falling deep into peaceful slumber, I was violently and rudely awakened by screaming police sirens and screeching tires.  Now, I'm used to sirens in the middle of the night - after all, it is Downtown - but not at this high volume.   After my heart began to beat again, I got up and went out onto my terrace to see what all the commotion was.  It was Fast and Furious 2.  They had closed of the entire 4 blocks of the street one block over for this scene, which apparently involves a high speed police chase outside a strip club.    Also, apparently, they didn't get it right the first time and had to re-shoot the scene around 2am - sirens and tires and all.   So, when you go see this movie (sometime next year probably) and you get to the scene outside a really colorful strip club with a green entrance, know that you're in my 'hood.  And when you hear the screaming sirens and the screeching tires, remember your Diva being ripped from her slumber at 2am when they shot that damn thing!  Ah, the glamourous life.   Diva out.

"        Hands on Miami Day  I sometimes volunteer with an organization called  urlLink Hands On Miami .

Saturday, November 2 is 'Hands On Miami Day' and I will be part of a large group of volunteers doing random acts of kindness as organized by H.O.M.  This is their largest fund-raising effort every year, and I need your help.    You may have noticed that little 'Donate' button at the top of my screen - near my counter.  If you haven't already seen it, I'm sure you're looking at it now.   This fabulous little button can make you a part of Hands On Miami Day without ever having to do any of the dirty work.  By clicking on that button, you will be walked through a process of donating money directly to me as my sponsor.    And if you want a reciept for being my sponsor I will be more than happy to send you one.  I need to collect this money and turn it in on the day of the event, November 2nd.  If you're not comfortable using your credit card over the internet, let me know and I can give you my mailing address - you can even make the check out to Hands On Miami if that will make you feel better.   I hope you will consider being a sponsor for me - I beleive that its really important to try and improve the world around you.  It's like that bumper sticker says -- think globally, act locally.  I'm acting, and I hope you will sponsor and support my action.  If you want to join me for this event, let me know and I'm sure something can be arranged!  Diva out.         "
"        Mysterious Stranger  I was ruminating on the latest developments of my blog and its new e-mail address last night.  I was hoping the Birth Control? was a miscellaneous stranger who had been drawn in by my blog content (see the tag board over there for reference).  Then it hit me... I have drawn in at least one random reader!  I feel so accomplished - of course I had to steal her content to get her attention, but hey, whatever works.  And actually, this has lead me to Blogs by Women.  You know me, I'm all about girl power; so of course I've joined the web ring.  It sounds so mysterious and elite, doesn't it?  Web ring... I'm picturing women dancing around in circles in the forest worshipping their goddess Bonni the web ring leader.  I feel so dark and mysterious.  LOL  - no longer just one divine diva, but one of many!  So, thanks for the connection Eliz.  Diva out.         "

"        My Soapbox  One of the benefits of a blog is that you can speak your mind and blather on for hours and hours about whatever it is that you think is ruining the world at large.  And I feel a little blathering coming on...  I have, of late, noticed in the course of conversations when the speaker categorizes other people, or themselves for that matter.  I.E. - 'We 'colors' are like that.'  I swear a man actually said that to me; granted he was from an older generation that grew up in segregation.  Sadly he apparently still lives in that world.    But I had it yesterday from someone closer to my own age group; and he had a box for every race you can think of.  The jews this, the argentinians that; even 'we puerto ricans...'.  Maybe its just me in my own little utopian mind, but I try to not categorize people based on color, religion or nationality - or anything else for that matter.  In my world, people are people.    And that's something I love about the internet and the blogs you can find on Blogger.  There are no color lines, no country boundaries, no geographical limits.  The internet highway transcends the physical limits we experience in our every day lives.  Yes, you can find a lot of hate and ugliness (like that  Shudder  e-mail I recieved today - man was that ugly!).  But generally, when you look at a blog, you don't necessarily see the color of the author or the sexual preference or the nationality or even what country they live in.  You see the blog and the ideas and life experiences expressed.  You are given information to determine how you feel about the person writing.  Just something to think about next time you start to shove someone into a categorical box.  People aren't buttons and tacks to be placed in boxes with labels - if they were you could be sure Martha Stewart would be selling the boxes AND the labels for neat little packaging.   I will not be packaged.    *now quietly and humbly stepping down from my soap box* Diva out.         "

"        Gotta love South Beach  Everyone who knows me, knows I work on South Beach.  I used to live on South Beach, but there's some law here that you can only live here if you're willing to piss your life away in a night club taking large amounts of alcohol and ecstasy.  Soooo, I had to leave.  But I am allowed to work here.  And my hotel receives this glamorous, shiny magazine called Lincoln Road.  It's all about the businesses, restaurants, clubs and people on and around Lincoln Road - a glorified strip mall here on the beach.

"        Monday blues   But, actually I'm not really very blue.  Feeling pretty good today.  Spending time with Leia yesterday may have something to do with it.   She is such a trip these days; she's only 3 but she speaks so clearly and expresses herself so well.   And she'll say hello to just about anyone, as long as mommy is close by.    Hmm, wonder if that would work to pick up men; guys use the baby decoy thing to pick up women, but I somehow don't think it works the same with men.  Although, I did have a man chat me up at the gas station; Leia wanted to drive and he said, 'Let her drive.  She can't be any worse than the old people around here.'  And then he smiled at me.  Hmmm....   Anyway, our new thing at home is to NOT say 'Hey!' because 'Hey' is for horses, according to Leia.  So I say it just to make her crazy.   Once when she was acting more like a wild animal than a girl I said, 'Hey, cut it out!'   Leia replied, 'Hay is for horses' and I said, 'Yeah, well, you're acting more like a horse than a girl, so I can say 'Hay!'.  She had no reply other than to weakly repeat herself, 'Hey is for horses, mommy.'  Now, everytime I say 'Hey' to someone, as in 'Hello' I automatically think of Leia's reprimand.   Ah, the things we learn from our children.  Diva out.         "

Wednesday, October 02, 2002    little boy blue  I have a horrible tendancy to lecture. This morning I lectured Michael on how important it is to pick up his trains (Toby likes to chew on them). I must have been extraordinarily long-winded.  Michael looked up at me and very seriously said, 'Shut your pie-hole, Mom, bitte!'  He spent three minutes on the boring time-out bench and then had to pick up his trains. I put them out of his reach.  No child of mine will get away with being disrespectful to an adult!  Now shut YOUR pie-hole. Your giggling is plucking my last nerve.          "

"        Ugh, haircut  Everytime I get my hair cut, I'm reminded of why I don't get my hair cut very often.  I'm talking like once every 7 or 8 months.  I can't take the added stress and grief any more often than that.  So, I took the plunge and went to the salon yesterday.  I know that as a reigning Diva, I should practically LIVE in the salon. But I don't.  Because not only am I a Diva, but I am also a single mom, and let's face it -- kids are expensive!  But, being that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY  I decided to pamper myself.  That and the fact that my hair was strangely reminiscent of cousin It.    Nothing drastic, no major chopping was done.  But, why is it that as soon as I get home I realize that I liked my hair the way it was.  I ultimately decide that I don't like what was done and that I could have done a much better job with hedge clippers and saved myself the 50 bucks I just spent.  Then, I almost always grab my scissors and destroy what I just spent 50 bucks on.  I try to resist the urge, but it is overwhelming and I almost always give in to just a few little snips here and there.  And then, finally, I come to the realization that in a few weeks it will grow back and I will be just fine.  *ugh*  BTW, did I mention that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY ?  Diva out.         "
"        I've lost it  Well, I was going to tell you all about my escapade in the men's bathroom Friday night, but I guess that will have to wait.  *she said teasingly as she quickly changed the subject*   Last night I lost it.  I may have totally blown my chance for 'Mom of the Year' Award after last night's scene.  I have a cold right now.  My two wonderful and loving daughters were sick a few weeks ago - I missed a few days of work to care for them - and now its my turn to be sick.   Of course, I would never miss work to take care of myself. So, I worked yesterday while nursing a full blown cold, then went home to cook dinner, empty the dishwasher, load the dishwasher, give the little one a bath, entertain my now very healthy children and then get them settled into sleep mode.  With a full blown cold.  After rocking the little one to sleep for 35 minutes, I laid her in her cute little toddler bed.  That's when she looked at up me and said she wanted her 'sippy cup' -  warm milk from a cup to help her fall asleep - when she was already asleep before I laid her down.  At first I thought to resist because I was sick and tired and sooooo ready for sleep.  But I knew that would only prolong my misery, so instead I wigged out.  'Fine! Let's get a sippy cup!' I bellowed at the top of my hoarse and scratchy voice.  I stormed out of the bedroom, leaving the little one stunned in her bed, and tromped into the kitchen.  Tore open the fridge, banged the sippy cup on the counter - it was a full-fledged tantrum.  I calmed down when Kala walked in to see what was wrong with me.    I felt like a three year old without a mommy, but then Kala gave me a little hug and I apologized for being such a brat.  I told her that I'm sick and want my mommy to take care of me!  She thought that was kind of funny, but then tried to find ways to sympathize with me.  Didn't make me feel better, but I knew that she was trying.    After my explosion, all was quiet again.  I apologized to Leia and Kala for freaking out, then rocked Leia back to sleep while Kala chatted frantically about her friends until she fell asleep on the sofa.  Then I went to bed and slept like a baby - with a full blown cold.  Diva out.          "
"        Happy Monday?  Well, here we are again.  Another Monday... and I have a few things to talk about - I realize that I now look for material for my blog.  Sad, I know.  But, hey, gotta get my kicks somehow. ;)  So, today I have the 'Diva is a hottie' story.  Yes, yes, we have already established that I am a 'foxy' diva.  If you need proof, check the archives for that little obscure test I 'borrowed' from  urlLink Life on the Ridge .  However, I was told a very funny story the other night that I just had to share.  As told by Marvin, I was the center of a scene one day on the street.  Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, I was unaware of the whole thing.  Marvin says he saw me walking around a corner in my fabulous diva-like way (my embellishment - Marvin thought it but didn't actually say it), and when I passed a man was apparently taken by my divaness.  So he thinks out loud to the crowd at the bus stop 'What a hottie!' and begins to skulk behind me making vulgar movements while following closely behind in a 'ooooh baby'-like fashion.  The crowd laughed at him because I was obviously ignoring him.  I ignored him when he walked face first into a pole making a very loud 'clunk' sound with his face.  Marvin says the whole thing was hysterical.  I'm sure it was... I just wish I had been there to see it!  See, I have a tendency to walk with my head up, looking straight ahead, staying very focused on where and how I step.  Because, while my closest friends know that I am the epitomy of style and grace - think Audrey Hepburn... shut up Dee! -- I do tend to be a little...um shall we say, clumsy?  Ok.  I have be known to trip over my own two feet while standing still and a tree has fallen on my head.  So, while this lovely *ahem* gentleman was ogling me in public, I was making sure I didn't fall on my face while stepping lightly over the cracks in the sidewalk!  Just another day in Diva-ville.   Diva out.         "
"        Oh, What a night!  Late September, back in 63,.... oh, sorry.  Got a little carried away there.  My mind is sort of wandering aimlessly this morning... must have something to do with too little sleep.  The Wine Club last night was absolutely amazing.  We had about 55 attendees, most of whom were new faces - and very nice looking faces at that.  So many of the 'right' people were here last night, and everyone one of them had a fabulous time.  The final count of empty wine bottles was 47 I think.  Almost a bottle of wine per person, with a never-ending stream of hors d'ouevres.  I buzzed through the crowd all evening long,  meeting new people and saying hello to familiar favorites.    I met a man who bid $2500 on an auction item to take a Wine Tour through Napa Valley - 8 days of nothing but wine and gourmet 5-course dinners each day.  I met a very attractive young man who owns a cigar company - he wants to host cigar & cognac events here.  Let's see, there was the realtor guy who has started attending regularly, sitting with 5 new female friends in the corner; my dear friend who has supported the club from its inception - his wide, soulful eyes alway focus on the crowd as he studies the evening's faces and actions.  Then there's the greek bath house manager who is a party in skin - he's such a wonderfully enthusiastic man, full of joie de vive.  A very rowdy bunch of women drew in our newest Wine Club regular into their little group of raucous fun for the rest of the evening.  And I met the organizer for the International Wine Fair - of which I hope to be a part... the event, not the man.  Although... ;)  All in all, it was a wonderful ending to a pretty good day.  Now I think I'll go get another cup of coffee.  Diva out.         "

"        I am blessed  Most of us just gripe when things go wrong.  Today, I'm giving thanks for the things that go right.  As a sagittarius, I know that I am the luckiest sign in the zodiac.  I also know that as an optimist, I always see the bright side of everything.  It helps avoid wrinkle lines by not worrying so much.  Today, I was concerned about my gas tank.  I've made a habit out of running on empty lately, and I'm close to that now.  I have to haul my cookies over to Hialeah this evening to drop off the girls at Grandma's house.  I have to then fly back over to the beach to host The Wine Club event at 7:30p.  2 hours sounds like a lot of time, but when you're travelling in Miami during rush hour traffic, its almost not enough time.  So, I'm thinking, 'Who am I going to borrow 10 bucks from?' when I am reminded that I'm doing a notary gig this morning at the hotel next door.  Yes, folks, along with all of my other fabulous abilities, I am a notary.  Closest to politician as I'll ever get.  So, I head over realizing that I'm getting $10 for this.  Exactly what I was hoping to borrow for gas later today.  And, after stamping a few pages for some very good looking, wealthy company Presidents sitting inside a very posh and fabulous hotel cabana room, I'm handed $40 and sent about my merry way.  I left there feeling very blessed indeed.  I'm am constantly reminded that you will get what you ask for, if you ask nicely.  The universe is my provider and I am so grateful for all that I have.  The $40 was just another reminder that what I need comes to me when I need it, and it reminded me of just how fortunate I am.   Feeling very fulfilled today.  Diva out.           "
"       Ok. first of all, I am very certain that the little blog roll thing down on the right is just not working.  The little 'blogs that like me' is causing me undue grief; here I am thinking nobody likes me *diva pouting pitifully*.  now i've come to the conclusion that the damn thing must not be working, because I personally crept into  urlLink Fred's blog  and put in a reference to myself and that little counter thing didn't catch it.

I do it all, its my job.  And I usually do it with a smile.  Today, however, someone apparently has a problem with me.  Maybe she had too much (or not enough) alcohol and/or prescribed drugs last night.  I don't know, but she's in a mood.    First of all, she strolls into the office at 1pm - later than her usual 11am ETA.  Then, she flips out because the contract she promised to someone yesterday is in her mailbox for proofing.  She could have turned a few degrees to her right and faxed the contract to her client without incident.  Instead, she climbed the two flights of stairs and crossed the hall to my desk, where she threw the contract onto my desk for me to fax.    A terse voicemail about another client (which I had already handled) and a phone call to me about an e-mail she never received - while the rest of our staff managed to get it - and the day is only just beginning.  I have to remember that work is my blessing.  I may just laugh at her next attempt to make me as miserable as she is today.  Diva out.         "

I know so many northern transplants here in Miami are overjoyed at the drop in temperature.  It's crisp and lively and the air is fresh.  Whatever.    All I know is I'm looking forward to warmer weather again.  If I wanted cold, I'd have chosen to live somewhere north.  Give me a good, muggy August afternoon at 95 degrees and let me live happily in Miami.  This cold crap is for the (snow)birds!  Diva out.         "
"        Happy Friday!   It is a happy Friday here in paradise.  At least that's what I'm going to keep telling myself until I believe it.  However, upon learning some very important news this morning I have reached the decision that some things have got to change.  And it will take more than a little hair color to fix.  I have to give up ice cream. *gasp!*  I know.  I know. Its a very drastic step.  My mind is screaming like a defiant two year old, 'No! I won't do it.'  But I must.  That and I will continue further along the path toward a vegetarian diet.   I know, its almost more than I can cope with.  But, apparently, while I was focusing on my emotional and spiritual well-being with yoga, meditation, books and the like, I forgot about my physical health.  Now my cholesterol is at 230 (200 is safe) and triglycerides are at... Dave, a drumroll please... 300. (100 is safe!)  And what with my paranoia regarding heart disease, I need to get back on track with a healthy diet and a little more cardio-related exercise.    Anybody know any yummy tasting, rich and creamy, Ben-and-Jerry's-ish fat-free, cholesterol-free ice cream?  Fat chance!    Diva out.         "
"        Didn't fall out of my tree!  Fred wondered if I had fallen out of my tree.  No, but I was out of the office for several days.  The littlest pinecone (Leia) has been sick since last Thursday.  Fever from 100 to 102 for about 5 days straight with a cough.  Her usual wonderful doctor, Dr. Leitner 'the nice lady doctor' wasn't in on the day I took Leia into the office.  The doctor who did see her couldn't find anything wrong with her, except a slight fever and a little chest congestion.   Duh.  No medicine prescribed, and I usually prefer to avoid antibiotics and such when they aren't needed.  However, in the meantime, I've missed about 3 days of work.    And just when I was beginning to wonder what damage a prolonged fever could do to a 3 year old brain, Leia started getting better.  She is in school today and feeling better somehow.  I'm back in the office, buried under a pile of work and endless voicemails asking if I've done this thing or that, where's that thing or the other.  My answer is the same.  I haven't really been here since last Thursday, so I haven't done it and I don't know where it is!  Diva out.         "
"        Gardening 101  I spoke to my mom today.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  I asked her to send me a pinecone.    There a little hard to come by in Downtown Miami, and I asked her to send me one.  'Why?' you ask. *while thinking I'm a little strange, too*  I've been reading a great book called 'Teachings of Love' by this amazing Vietnamese Buddhist Monk *my strangeness reveals itself*.  In one chapter, he discusses how we are a part of our family and our family is a part of us.  Sometimes, when we stand apart from our family (especially here in the West), we can become confused.  We can suffer like a tree that has become uprooted when we sever the roots of our family.    And that's me in a nutshell.  Family has been a collection of people that had very little to do with who I am and what I am.  Then I realized that's not true.  While I'm not a branch or a flower on the tree, I am still part of that family tree.  I'm a pinecone.  I've left the tree, but its still in me, made me who I am, and I am still part of the tree.  I'm a pinecone, taking the nature of that family with me, and growing my own roots somewhere else.  Continuing my family with a family of my own.  So today, I asked my mom to send me a pinecone as a reminder of who I am.  I tried explaining it to her.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  And I can only guess what fodder I've provided for Fred Gerbilman.  But at the risk of sounding strange, I'll end by saying 'Spiritual lesson over for today, grasshopper.'  Diva out.         "

"        Old Reliable  Every morning as I drive over the causeway, I see this man running.  He's not running away from anything, he's just running.  And not just on sunny mornings; in rain and cold he's out there.  I've seen him as early as 8:10am, and as late as 10:15am.  So, he jogs back and forth over the two causeway bridges for at least 2 hours every day.  And I can't help but wonder why.  I feel like stopping my car, getting out on the side of the road and asking him.  What motivates him to do this?  Why could jogging possibly be so important to him?  He gets out of his bed very early every morning and devotes several hours of his precious time to this task.  As much as I love running, I'm lucky if I get a good 4 miles of running in once a month. He does this EVERY DAY.  I'm just amazed at how some people can be so dedicated to their principles.  So steadfast and reliable in their everyday routines.     I'm sure I'll have more to say today - I'm feeling very chatty.  So, Diva out... for now.         "
"        Stunned and Amazed  What kind of sub-human robs a  church?   I hope they find out, because someone broke into the church where my youngest goes to daycare.  Imagine my uncertainty when pulling into the driveway as I counted 4 news vans and a crime scene unit parked in front of the church.  I've seen news trucks there before.  When the Elian thing happened, the nun who was helping him was holed up in a mansion across the street to hide from the media and the protestors.  All of that in front of the church and daycare that had no connection to any of it.  I had to take my daughter out early that day for safety.  So today I was wondering what could have happened, and would Leia be safe.    Turns out some creep broke in to the church, the church office and the daycare office looking for -- ?? Money?? The thief apparently didn't find the cash stored away in the daycare office, because its still there.  The pastor's car was taken however.     It's just shameful.  I'm sorry for the pastor and the violation she must be feeling.  I know it sucks to have someone come in and touch your stuff, let alone  take  your stuff.  But I also feel sorrow for the thief.  How low do you have to be to break into God's house?  Even if its not your religion,  it's God's house!   And I wonder if the thief figured the pastor wouldn't press charges if caught - you know, forgiveness and all that.  HAH!  Even Jesus displayed 'righteous indignation'.    Just a sad thing to see first thing in the morning.  Diva out.         "

As mentioned, Wednesday's Wine Club event was fabulous.  Halloween trick or treating was a blast.  Went door to door in a quiet little neighborhood and the girls got lots and lots of treats.  Friday I was supposed to go to a party, but I just didn't have the strength to make the 60 mile drive.    Saturday was Hands On Miami Day; I was assigned to painting a mural in a Salvation Army homeless shelter.  I must say that I was very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the shelter - it was more like a nursing home, but with mothers and children.  Made me feel good just knowing that these children - very much like my own - were safe with a roof over their heads.  Just gave me the warm & fuzzies --  no smart ass comments, Joe!   Saturday night was the Bug Ball, where my Wine Club sponsored the wine for the party.  Very nice collection of socialites and party-goers together for the good of the garden.    Sunday I stayed in bed till noon - I just didn't have the energy to get up until then.  Monday was catch up time in the office, and I'm finally back on track and on-line.  So, no Joe.

So I spent 30 minutes and 3 dollars on a car wash last night.  There's a 70% chance of rain today. Figures.  And, why is it, that no matter how many times you explain something to someone; tell them, put it in written memo as a standard procedure, ask them, beg them... it just never gets done right.  Arrgh!  Considering it was concering reservations for New Year's Eve, and I no longer (nor ever did) have a handle on it all, it would now be moot to complain.

"        Something to Ponder  From  urlLink Friday Five :  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? Toss up between getting into my own apartment in January and getting child support.  2. What was your biggest disappointment? DBD losing his job after only 3 months, thereby losing my child support.  3. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Yes - to create stronger bonds with the people I know & love.  4. Where will you be at midnight? Do you wish you could be somewhere else?  Working at my hotel, standing on Miami Beach watching fireworks with glass of champagne in hand - and I get paid to do this!  5. Aside from (possibly) staying up late, do you have any other New Year's traditions?  I just believe that whatever you are doing on NYE sets the theme for the new year.  And for my own thoughts, not ones borrowed from  urlLink Eliz     Things I've learned this year.  1. How to get the child support & judicial system to work without the aid (?) of a lawyer. 2. That I could very easily become the same kind of parent that my parents were - egad!  3. How to be mindful of what I say and do and how to think/speak only loving things. 4. That people who move away do not necessarily leave me behind. 5. I have abandonment issues. 6. 2002 was difficult and I still managed to keep my head up and smile through it all. 7. Yoga is life.  I believe that every day is a lesson to be learned and each year is just another opportunity to create more love and joy in our lives.  So, what did 2002 teach you?  Diva out.           "
"        Sigh of relief  Well, thank god that's over!  Christmas Day is history.  Surprisingly, it was a great day... the best that I can remember.  I always had this idea of what I would like Christmas to be, but every year the day left me disappointed.  This one left me feeling satisfied instead.  We went to two Christmas Eve dinners, one Cuban and one Mexican - both with pork.  Very yummy and lots of fun with friends, old and new.  My girls are growing into true party girls - we were out until 2am and they managed to be in good moods the whole time.   On Christmas morning, they were up at 7:30am so I was up at 7:31am.  Didn't get to bed until 3am.  Ouch.  But there were so many gifts under the bamboo tree for them (thanks to my parents, my brother, my sister & her husband), and even a few for me!  I got some of the best gifts ever - including a beautiful pair of opera glasses (I've been wanting a pair for a few years now), a digital camera and Oscar de la Renta perfume & cream (Thanks Tony!).  And we spent Christmas Day with my family in Palm Beach. Grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins all from my mother's side of the family.  Even though they only live 2 counties away, I never see them.  Its a stange thing about Dade County.  People who don't live here rarely come here.  People who do live here rarely leave.    But it was a great day for sure.  Family, turkey, presents and carols and more desserts than we could possibly finish in one day.    I hope that your day was just as nice ~ that no matter what you did, you enjoyed it completely.

Also, I took my girls to Brunch with Santa on Saturday - a very nice gift from one of my co-workers.  Actually, Saturday was Holiday Day in my little family of girls.  After Santa, we went to the mall with money from Mom and bought the girls each a new outfit.  Crowds were bad, but not unpleasant.  And the sales were good.  Even got to see a special holiday show in cirque du soleil style.    After being 'malled', we went to a Holiday-themed carnival here in Downtown Miami, replete with glowing palm trees and neon Magic City Miami sign!  There was a traditional holiday village with Santa and his reindeer and the little snow-painted houses, along with lots of rides and stuff, with holiday music in the background.  They even had an ice-skating rink (fake of course) along Biscayne Bay.  With the boat parade and full moon over the Bay behind, it made for quite a memorable evening.  I do love Miami, and I'm in the holiday mood, in spite of myself.  Diva out.         "
"        Bah Humbug  I'm one of those people who waits until Christmas Eve to do all their shopping.  I do love the rush of a deadline, and of course I usually don't have any cash to spend until the payday before Christmas anyway.    Here in our little slice of paradise, where I work, we get paid on every other Thursday.  I was thinking that since the Holiday was on Wednesday we would get paid on Tuesday.  Then, I was informed that payroll was being done one day early - so I figure that was to allow for payday on Tuesday.  Wrong!  Apparently, while I thought I was working for a nice person, I am in actuality working for Mr. Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Payday will be on Thursday, as usual.  The day AFTER Christmas. *sigh*  So, to date I have bought exactly one Clifford wristwatch and I have 'acquired' a Vanessa Carlton CD.  And with my mother-in-law and her entire family (including DBD) in New Jersey supporting the family after the tragedy, there isn't much of a Christmas to look forward to.  Thankfully,  my mom & sister have played Santa this year and sent me SEVERAL boxes of gifts for the girls (and even a little something or two for me) So it won't be a total dissappointment (I hope).

For every little thing that bothered me yesterday my inner voice reminded me that at least I didn't start the day by dying.  *and don't worry, I don't have little voices in my head, Fred*  I just kept reminding myself of how fortunate I am in everything.  And I was reminded that, even though I do have serious money problems which I expect to become more serious in the next few months - thanks to the unemployed DBD - sometimes money doesn't matter.  There are other problems in life.  I kissed and hugged my girls more than usual yesterday evening.   Stood outside on the balcony, 25 floors above Miami last night.  Stared out at the twinkling stars that are the city lights below me and silently gave thanks for all that I have.  Diva out.         "

Now, I think I have.  Because that's what I was up doing until 11pm last night.  Painstakingly and lovingly done as gifts for everyone that has become special to me this year.  Sunday I baked 6 dozen cookies, tonight I'll bake another 10.  And then lovingly wrap each one first in cellophane and then in paper tied with a ribbon.  I never knew I had it in me.

"        Just tragic   I've read all the Dostoevsky novels, those sad and dark tales where people die from chest colds and madness.  That was way back when people used coal for heat in their homes, and travelled by horse-drawn buggy.  This is 2002, almost 2003.  Things like that just don't happen anymore.  At least that's what I thought until now.    I received a phone call this morning on the way to work.  That was my first indication that something was wrong - my cell never rings in the morning.  It was my mother-in-law, who only calls in the morning  to be the first to wish her granddaughters a happy birthday.  Today was not a birthday.  Bad news was her reason for calling today.  As I listened, she explained that her brother called her today, first thing in the morning.  She had the same thought - he never calls that early in the morning, not even for birthdays.  Bad news was his reason for calling.  Their 20 year old daughter had caught a cold a few days ago, and was feeling having trouble breathing last night due to the congestion.  She went to sleep last night, woke up this morning unable to breath.  The ambulance was called and she was taken to the hospital, but sometime this morning she died.    Unbelievable, incredulous, impossible news.  I don't understand how this can happen.  I was dumbstruck and griefstricken all at the same time.  I wasn't very close to her, but she is my mother-in-law's niece, and very loved in our family.  This isn't some Dostoevsky novel, this is our life.  Death has touched our family and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to console my mother-in-law in her loss but I don't even know where to begin.  Before she hung up with me she asked me to take very good care of her girls (my daughters).  I told her of course I would.    I may have more thoughts on this later today, but I feel like just putting this into my blog may help relieve some of the sadness in my heart somehow.  And of course, as I always dwell on things in a philosophical manner, I am sure I will have more to say on this later.    Once the shock has worn off.  Diva out.         "
"        Almost perfect   The Diva had a date.  I know, you're thinking, 'Of course she did.  As fab as she is, she must go out on dates all the time.'  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway, I was invited to a holiday party on Saturday night, and I have to say it was one of the best dates I have been on in years, perhaps ever.  We went to a company holiday party, where I sat at a boring table with extended warantee salesmen and a very spoiled wife.  Listened to a speech about how great the 'team' is doing, yadda yadda.  The most interesting part was when I met a guy who went to my high school and graduated 11 years before me.    But I got to dance to one of my most favorite slow songs ever, 'Lady in Red' - I just love that song and I've never had the opportunity to dance to it (with another person that is).  And my friend was funny and charming and such a gentleman.  Helped me with my coat, made sure I was comfortable, offered to get me drinks from the bar.  Just the perfect date.  Then, he took me to a Wine Bar, owned by a friend of his.  Now, not only am I a diva, but my alter ego is a wine diva!  So, I was in heaven!  They had a wine list to die for!  After drooling over the list, I selected a glass of a French Chardonnay called Fat Bastard.  I couldn't resist the name!  It was really very good.    We sat outside, in very chilly weather, and kept cozy next to a wood burning stove and talked for a long time.  It was such a great evening, and he thanked me for making his night so special.  Sounds great, right?  Well, as this entry's title implies, it was almost perfect.  Unfortunately, I don't see this friend in a romantic light.  He's very nice, attractive, tall, etc.  But, no chemistry.  Damn, imagine that wood burning stove with a little chemistry.  *sigh*  But, most importantly I was on a date instead of home alone.  And it was a great evening.  Diva out.           "
"        Checked my  urlLink 'scope  this morning  Sometimes these things are just so dead on its scary.    'With the sun in your sign, your wish is like a command to the universe but you know what they say about being careful with wishes. Add to that, your imagination is either a source of incredible strength or weakness right now. You could just about manifest anything from a mere thought but before you become the proud new owner of a passing thought, make sure its what you really, really want. Take some time out this morning to imagine that you have your most heartfelt desire. Then what would you do? Remember that half the fun of getting something new is in the hunt, whether its for a job, a love or a new pair of shoes.'  God god, I'm looking for two out of three of those RIGHT NOW (never you mind which two).  And, whether you believe it or not, I already know about making my desires manifest.  I realize that I have an uncanny ability to make myself the 'owner of a passing thought' and have done so on many occasions.  Actually, we all have that ability - we just don't all develop and use it to its fullest potential.  Here's a test - next time your driving in an unfamiliar area, tell yourself you really really want a 7-11, or a Burger King - whatever.  But really really want to see one.  Want to see it because you're testing the universe and your own ability to tap into it.  See if you get what you want.  Freaks me out whenever I try it!

The holiday spirit just doesn't descend upon me until then.  But it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here.  We're making holiday cards this year - an old-fashioned Christmas; and we're baking all of our gifts.  Mini pumpkin pies, sugar drop cookies, pumpkin bread and the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted.  And they ship well, too.  Last night we decided (we being my two children) that it was time to decorate the tree.  Only problem is that we don't have a tree.  Got lost in all the moving over the past 3 years, I guess.  So, I suggested we decorate the bamboo tree on the terrace.  They loved it!  And after we were finished with the tree (we being mostly me this time), it looked pretty good.  Why shouldn't you have a bamboo tree for Christmas in Miami?  We are the epitomy of tropical chic. *grin*  And, if it had been 40 degrees colder last night, it would have snowed.  At 74 degrees, what we got was rain.  Truly a tropical Miami Christmas *sigh*  Diva out.         "

I finally decided to clear away any and all feelings of hurt, anger, jealousy and whatever else may be lurking about in my mental garden regarding him.

"        revenge is mine?  Always thinking and always considering the other point of view... or at least trying to.

In certain circumstances it seems like a wonderful thing - giving up everything for true love... I just hope she was worth it.  I mean that wholeheartedly.  If he's found 'the one' then he did what was right for his heart and soul.  Of course, that doesn't excuse him from his financial and paternal responsibilities... he may still learn to balance everything properly.  And then I started thinking, as bad as its been for me, he hasn't had it so easy either.  In the past three years, he lost the best paying job he'd ever had, he was evicted and ended up moving in with the new girlfriend (perhaps only out of necessity?), was unemployed for almost a year, then lost his new job after only 3 months.  On top of that, he has been the subject of child support enforcement legal action and now has a warrant out for his arrest.  Pretty shitty year, if you ask me.  All I can wonder is, is she worth it?  And while she has stood beside him through a lot, will she stand firm through whatever else comes?    Then, there is this little, ugly satisfaction in knowing that once he left my happy little world, he lost it all.  Diva out.         "
"        an afterthought  Always be careful what you ask for, because what you want will come.  But the Universe sometimes has a very twisted sense of humor.  I was wanting a man who was interested in a commitment... what I got was a man who was already in a commitment.  Now that I think on it, all of the men I met this past year were in a relationship with someone else.  Only it took me a little while to figure it out. *sigh*  Come on 2003... and I promise to be more careful about what I ask for.  Diva out.         "
"        and it just keeps coming  While mentioning a friend's name to someone today, the co-worker in the conversation says, 'You know he got married last August, right?  Yeah, he married so-and-so who used to work with us.'  I tried to retain my composure, because I'm thinking back to when I saw him in October, and he wasn't acting like a married man.  Hmm, go figure.  So, I've put out a call to verify what I'm sure is the truth.  I figure, I'll give him the chance to come clean, since I'm not going to ever see him again anyway.  See exactly what category of creep he is... one caught up in emotional overload or one who just likes to get away with all he can.  Can't wait to see how this one turns out.  Diva out.         "
"        Oh, now its working   This morning I had wanted to write happy little thoughts about things that make me happy.  But the publishing tool for my blog wasn't working.  And now all the happy thoughts are gone.  Why, you ask?  Well, after not receiving any notice or money regarding the purge payments from my dead-beat-dad ex-husband.  I had been receiving both on a pretty regular basis up until the first week of November.  Then, nothing.  No little love notes from the state attorney's office telling me that he showed up for the court date.  No little envelopes containing the check that was keeping him out of jail.  It all stopped cold.  So, I called the State Attorney's Office for Child Support today.  First I had to hold for 20 minutes, then give the ritual information of name, social security number, current address, yadda yadda, ad naseum.  Then, I finally got to tell the nice lady that I just want to know what's going on.  She advised me that a warrant was issued for his arrest last month, when he didn't show up with the purge payment.    Of course, I have reservations about how this will affect my karma.  However, considering the guy is now unemployed and no longer contributing to the support of his children, I say let him serve his 45 days.  At this point, it makes no difference to me at all.    As long as I don't have to explain to my children why Daddy can't visit us for Christmas.  Diva out.           "

"        Monday again  Another week ahead, and according to my  urlLink horoscope guy , it has some significance. Something to do with the solar eclipse and Jupiter.    All I know is, I'm now 33 and very pleased about that.  It's funny how when I tell someone how old I am, they say I look much younger.  Like, somehow, younger is better, more attractive and thereby more valuable.  All my life I've wanted to look my age, not younger.  I've always looked forward to 40, but all of a sudden I realize... didn't Jesus and Buddha realize their true identity at 33?  I'm at a good age, and I want to make the most of every minute!  Had a great birthday, spent it with some very dear friends; had two cosmopolitans too many and at my age you'd think I would know better.  But, I made my sacrificial offering to the great porcelain god on the morning of my 33rd birthday, and I believe that I am blessed for the rest of the year.  Diva out.         "
"        My Internet Garden   I realize that I have been a little preoccupied with blogging.  What with daily entries, keeping up with all of my blogging friends, and then there's that 'NextBlog' link with promises of something new and undiscovered.  The internet has a way of creeping slowly into your daily activities, like some creeping vine.  Before you know it, all of your time is tangled up in e-mail, IM, music videos and online journals.  Well, I already stay online all day at work anyway - the system automatically logs me in.  At least my private life hasn't been invaded by the internet... I don't have a computer at home *gasp*.  But now I have a cell phone with a browser, and am considering upgrading my service -- and then I will be completely overwhelmed by IM and blogging!  Hmmm... addiction?  Is there an Internet version of AA?  Amazing the things you have to be concerned about these days.  Not watching too much tv, but spending too much time online.  Either way, you're spending all of your time staring into a brightly lit screen.  And of course, since I do this at work, there is the special consideration of trying to get work done in between my online forays.  Heaven forbid I lose my job over the internet -- how ever would I ever get online then?  So, today I'm tending to my work, trimming the entry to keep it short, and staying out of the weeds.  So much to do!  Diva out.         "
"        One man's trash...  is another man's treasure, so they say (whoever 'they' are).  I had a threesome of this yesterday, so I figured it earned a place in blog history.  First, I had a client call to ask about a local magazine that we recieve here at the hotel regularly for our guests.  It has Pamela Anderson on the cover of its 10th Anniversary Issue (January 03), and he knows someone in Kid Rock's band who can get Pamela to autograph it for him.  It was such a big deal for him that I promised to do my best and get my hands on two of them as he asked.   Turns out, all I had to do was walk down to our Housekeeping department and ASK.  We have tons of them.    So, off they went to my guest up north, and he's so very grateful and what can he do to repay me?  Well, he's a jewelry broker, so I'm sure we'll think of something.  *sparkle-sparkle*  Then, there was the request at daycare posted to the door upon entering.  Please bring in three empty film canisters and an empty tissue box.  Trash, that I would keep lying around just for such instances.  Actually, I just threw a tissue box away last Friday, and I left 3 film canisters at my mother-in-law's house over the weekend to get the film inside developed.  The children are making instruments - except for mine of course, because I threw all of that stuff away!  And then there was the binder I found tucked away on a shelf yesterday.  I use lots of binders at work -- lots of 'em.  I need a new 2 inch binder to replace an old 2 inch binder that has busted out of its 2 inches.  So, I went to remove one from a shelf that's been sitting there unnoticed for who know's how long.  I check with my office mates to make sure it's OK I take this particularly lovely 2 inch binder for my own.  All of a sudden, one of my colleagues decides that the information inside could be valuable to him, and please don't use THAT binder.  And as it turned out, he started using the info in that binder today and it has been very useful indeed.  Go figure.  Diva out.         "
"        Blogger's Back   But I have nothing clever to say today.  My head hurts, and I suspect it is due to my sinus using my left eyeball as a punching bag.  That's where the ache is concentrated, but with the help of a little extra strength something or other, I should be feeling a little better (and more medicated) soon.  As an afterthought, it seems my beneficence is at work with my current number 1.  He's being considered for a job making a ridiculous amount of money, which makes him very happy.  And, it will put him closer to me for 6 months out of the year.  The other 6 will put him in Missouri.  Um... does anyone here know where that is?  Somewhere cold, I'm sure.  Diva out.         "
"       And now, here's a perfect example of why I prefer Miami.  Thank you  urlLink Mimi Smartypants  for making this thermal annoyance so very clear to our readers.   'Also, the most unsexy striptease in the history of people taking off their clothes is the one I do huddled up next to the radiator before getting naked to shower, because first I take off the gigantoid sweatshirt that I wear while reading and drinking tea in the mornings, with the hood up and the fingerless mitten cuff things over my hands. Then there are pajama pants and wool socks to be shed, and the flannel shirt under the sweatshirt, and the t-shirt under that, and the underwear, and this whole time I have the shower going already to try and steam up the bathroom a bit. And my skin is very dry and scaly in this weather, so I wish I could have a Lotion Shower right next to the regular shower. I read somewhere that to combat dry skin in the winter you are supposed to take lukewarm showers but sorry, thank you for playing, that sounds awful.'

"        A Diva's work is never done  I did it.  I don't know how, but I did it.  I moved from one apartment to another, from the 25th floor to the 7th, all in one weekend.  Started around 1pm on Saturday and finished by 5:30pm on Sunday.  Of course, I could never have done it without my friends and family who volunteered to help a Diva out in her time of need.  There were 8 of us in all, the guys moved the heavy furniture and the rest of us girls moved everything else gypsy style - on wheels and in bags, down the elevator to the new apartment.  No packing or unpacking, just move it from one place and put it in its new place.  Everything is in its place, even have the pictures on the walls.  And, while I had to give up the 25th floor view, I must admit that I like my new, closer to the ground view.  I hear the birds singing in the trees in the morning and yesterday I heard church bells.  It made for a very nice Sunday morning.  I have a very sunny balcony, and a great view of Downtown Miami.  And the rent is a little more than $100 cheaper.  A Diva's gotta do what a Diva's gotta do.   And now a Diva's gotta get some work done, so...  Diva out.         "

Ever since then, you have been on the lookout for a good answer. You have heard lots of explanations. You have contemplated many alternatives. You remain though, unsure about the best way to proceed. Now, you are remembering the reason why you asked that question in the first place. Don't feel frustrated because you don't, so far, have a satisfactory plan you can believe in.

So, telling him about my newest development when he had NO CLUE was very hard for me.  Shakes my faith in my own convictions; and let's face it until recently I've never been very good about sticking to my convictions.    My hands were shaking, and I felt queasy while telling him that I am now seeing someone else.    So, after I finished telling him, I called my number 3, who is currently the number 1 and only.   His voice reassured me (a little) and now my hands aren't quite so shaky.  I'm thinking lunch is out of the question though.  Diva out.         "

We left at half time because, let's face it; two little girls get bored after an hour or so.  But it was a great time, and they each left with a Miami Heat shirt.

"        Happy Girl  First of all, I did the Wine Club thing last night.  We hosted the US Sommelier Assocation French Wine Gala featuring over 150 wines.  Yes, 150.  We packed the room with over 200 people, and the wine flowed for 2 hours.  It was amazing.  Everyone had a great time, the wines were fabulous and all I got out the whole evening was three sips of a Veuve Cliquot Rose.  But, boy was it good.  The Dinner that followed had a bit of fiasco at seating, but in the end it worked out and everyone enjoyed themselves.  I ducked out at 10pm, leaving the revelers to finish the evening out on their own.  After trekking over to Hialeah for the girls, I finally got home about 11pm.  Needless to say, I got into the office a little later than usual today.    I did have a really nice thing happen this morning that I just had to share.  My little one went on an errand with me to the bank this morning before I dropped her off at daycare.  Outside the bank she plucked a dandelion flower, which kept her entertained on the ride to daycare.  Just before we got there, she noticed that the stem was broken, so she said it was dying.  She was very sad about this, and I explained that once you pick a flower it's going to die.    She decided that we should replant the little flower.  It became her little mission this morning to find a suitable home for her little flower outside the daycare.  She 'planted' it among some other flowers in a planter outside the daycare door.  She seemed very pleased with herself, for having saved the little flower.  I immediately felt a rush of pride and love for my littlest daughter.  Her little heart has love and compassion for even the smallest flower, and I hope that she maintains that quality as she grows.  I was also filled with hope; if this one little girl can have so much love, maybe there are more like her.  As they grow, they could create what a few of us long for now.  A peaceful, loving world filled with compassionate people.    It's a far cry from replanting a plucked dandelion... or is it?  Diva out.           "

"        Grumble and Growl   Almost 2 weeks ago I called my Insurance Agent, who had always proven himself to be very knowledgeable and helpful in the world of auto insurance.  I don't sell auto insurance, so I don't know anything more than how to pay my premium.  God forbid I have to make a claim, but if so, I'd call him.  The Omniscient One, as far as I'm concerned for insurance.  I called him to ask advice on making my LAST PAYMENT for the policy.  I had received the notice of intent to cancel, and I had until Tuesday the 7th to pay.  I told him I had two options - either borrow the money from someone and pay on time, or I would wait until Thursday the 9th when I got paid.  He advised that while the policy would be cancelled, payment would be accepted and the policy would be reinstated.    So, I followed his sage advise, and paid on the 10th.  Mr. Omniscient said that paying late would be okay, and I believed him.  What a schmuck I am!  Last night I got the notice that, while the payment had been recieved, it was declined and the insurance was not reinstated.  So, I've been driving around for a week without insurance, and $200 lighter in my pocket.  I could have used that $200 for the rent.  So, I called Mr. Omniscient first thing this morning, and he's all, well, the payment was late, and now you have to buy a whole new policy.  I'm thinking he knew all along that this would happen - I'm sure he gets commission on new policies.   Of course I figure this out a little too late.  I am getting a refund in the mail, which will help to pay for a new policy, but I am NOT going to use that disceptive little creep of an insurance salesman.  I'm a little wiser, with $200 back in my pocket, and searching for another quote online.  And considering the Mercury Retrograde that I was fully warned about, I really shouldn't be at all surprised by the turn of events.    But I am and I'm pissed off.  Add to that broke, and that's me in a nutshell.  Life as a Diva isn't always what its cracked up to be.  Diva out.         "
"        Other People's Children  Other people's children are never as cute as mine. Or as well-behaved.  Yesterday, the hotel was the site of a casting call for children.  The day started with cute toddlers tagging along behind young mothers with apparently no job to prevent them from hanging around our hotel lobby all day.  I'm thinking the kids are earning the paycheck in those families.  As the day progressed, the ages progressed, so that by 5pm there was a very noisy collection of children in ages ranging from 2 upward to about 10.  By this point, the bored children and likewise bored mothers were not paying attention to each other.  Kids running around the lobby to keep themselves occupied, mothers vying for preferential treatment from the casting directors.    Noisy chattering children, running around unattended.

"        This is an improvement?  I'm getting a new, updated computer today.  Which, of course, will take me some time to get familiar with.

Still, it will be faster than what I'm working on now.  As it is, I can send a document to the printer, go down two flights of stairs, put 2 quarters into the coke machine, coke drops, go back up two flights of stairs, sit at my desk, open the coke, and voila, my document begins to print.

"        Raise your hand if you're sure  I'm not sure why I'm so confident these days.  Maybe its something that comes with age.  I was thinking last night about how I'm no longer insecure about my body.  At 33, after two children, I'm in pretty good shape, 'kept my figure' as they say.  I'm not big on exercise, although I do enjoy yoga and the occasional run on the beach.  I used to be much more active.  When I was younger (and weighed less) I was so self-concious about my body - especially on those wonderful occasions when I got to be naked with someone.  I've always enjoyed the sensation of being naked next to someone else who was naked.  But, I would try to cover this little curve or that, uncertain of what unkind image it may be portraying of me.  But lately, on those now (unfortunately!) rare occasions when I get to be naked with someone, I don't even think about my body.  I don't care what image it portrays.  I guess I'm just comfortable in my own skin these days.  And let's face it, if I'm comfortable enough with a man to be naked, I'm going to be pretty sure he likes what I've got to offer anyway!   Maybe yoga has helped me to accept exactly who I am, and nevermind the body I'm encased in.  Form is my manifestation, and whatever you read in my body's shape and size has much to do with what I eat and how active I am.  But it doesn't have much to do with my soul and Self.  I have always hoped that as I grew older, I would get wiser.  If this is all I get, I'll be fine.  It's nice to finally not freak out about the skin I'm in.  Diva out.         "

I'm not a scripting genius... still waiting on the results of the referrer, remember?  The blog cleanup is just the beginning.  I am planning on moving to a slightly smaller apartment, in the same building, to pay less rent.  With no child support payments on the horizon, I'm thinking smaller apartment is better than no apartment.  And I didn't really like cleaning that 2nd bathroom anyway.

"        Gotta love him!  I sent this littel tidbit to my boss, telling him that instead of Adminitrative Diva, we should put this on my business cards.  factotum \fak-TOH-tuhm\ (noun)   *1 : a person having many diverse activities or responsibilities  2 : a general servant        Did you know? 'Do everything!' That's a tall order, but it is exactly what a factotum is expected to do. It's also a literal translation of the New Latin term 'factotum,' which in turn traces to the Latin words 'facere' ('to do') and 'totum' ('everything'). In the 16th century, 'factotum' was often used in English as if it was a surname, paired with first names to create personalities such as 'Johannes Factotum' (literally 'John Do-everything'). Back then, it wasn't necessarily desirable to be called a 'factotum'; the term was a synonym of 'meddler' or 'busybody.' Now the word is more often used for a handy, versatile individual responsible for many different tasks.  His reply?  'LOL.  Be careful with the spelling....'

Graying, but not thinning.  Oh, and I could never, not ever, want a farm in Iceland (or anywhere else for that matter.)  Okay, disclaimer over.  Read on, dear reader!  Tuesday, December 31, 2002   Happy New Year!  I'd like to take this time to say hello, and goodbye, and wish everyone a warm year's ending. Personally, this year, the palindrome of all years: 2002, in many ways has been one of the most successful for me, and in other ways I detested waking up and wanted to hide under my bed for hours and days on end, but alas, we must move forward and embrace out journeys through life. 2002 reflects upon itself, as I looked in the mirror, staring at my reflection, an image I cannot fake to the world. My face has new changes, my hair is a lot less these days (and thinning), my eyes have grown more cynical, my voice has grown stronger, and my focus to live boldly and write truthfully and take risks seems to led me back on track... 2002 reflects itself, as I too reflected upon myself to see many things: good, bad, and ugly. We are who we are, and we're going to go where we're headed, and I wish everyone sanity, peace, joy, happiness on your trip through 2003, and I hope one of you wins the lottery this year so you can lend me $50,000 for a down payment on a farm in Iceland. With that being said, I consider myself a wealthy man, not because of my net worth, but rather the people in my life who love, listen, support and inspire me. My wealth is a result of my friendships, and because of you, I must say... Thanks.   Happy New Year.   Be Sweet!  urlLink Pauly  31 Dec 2002           "

"        Better today  Not feeling quite so overwhelmed today.  For no apparent reason, just feeling better.  Must have something to do with the planets or something.  Must see what Jonathan has to say today.  The hotel is buzzing, we're the host and headquarters for The Miami International Film Festival.  The lobby is full of people, we have events every night this week (including the Wine Club on Thursday night) and as we all know, I am happiest when I am busy.  And when the hotel is busy, I am busy.  Which is why I haven't had much time for blogging or surfing.  Work keeps interfering.  But I had a good weekend, except for sleeping in a recliner on Saturday night.  No matter what anyone ever tells you, the recliner is NOT a good alternative to a bed.  My neck is so stiff that I sometimes catch myself walking with my head hunched down because it doesn't hurt that way.  Like those old men you see waiting for a bus with his head hunched way too far forward to be comfortable, and you think for a split second, 'What's he looking for?'  But that's just the way he holds his head... and now that's almost how I hold my head too.  Stretching is helping to hold my head high again.  Some official office closed down the daycare yesterday.  They painted over the weekend and the smell was so strong that the City or somebody official, Dept of Health? came, took one whiff of the paint smell and shut them down.  2 days of no daycare.  I brought the littlest diva into the office yesterday for a few hours. Luckily it was naptime while she was here and I was able to get some work done while she slept.  Today she is with Grandma - once again thank goodness for Grandma!  The daycare should be open again tomorrow and life will be back to what I call normal.  Kala is set to go on her first overnight school-sponsored field trip.  She goes to St. Augustine in March with her class.  I told her in the beginning of the year that if she was selected to go I would find the money somehow for her to go.  She's always had issues with paying attention and being quiet in class, and behavior was taken into consideration for this trip.  Not all kids are going, but my baby is on the list!  So, I had to get the cash together.  Not easy, but that's why I worked 28 hours weekend before last.  She lived up to her part of the bargain so I kept my word.  And perhaps the reason I'm feeling so good today; I had a happy little phone call this morning returning a call from last night.  Sometimes its just nice to hear a friendly voice say, 'Have a good day!' first thing in the morning.  Because, I am.  Diva out.         "
"        Why, why, why?!  What is it about men?  Why is it that when you finally decide to step back, they want to step forward?  I have been seeing several men on a very irregular basis.  Several means 4 or 5 and the number varies because they all contact me so sporadically.  It comes in cycles, like feast or famine, you know?    Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post, Door number 3 stepped up and asked for more.  I accepted the offer, but now he's moving to Missouri and we don't speak on a regular schedule.  It was very short-lived and I need a more regular guy.  I've started pursuing another avenue, one that has remained constant and in the background and always with a promise of something truly wonderful.  Very far away and difficult to hold on to, but hope springs eternal.  My focus has shifted.  But in the meantime, while I was making number 3 my number 1,  I informed all of the scattered few that I was no longer accessible to them.  Friend yes, 'friend' No.   My love life hasn't been this busy (or confusing) in ages!  One now says he loves me (via e-card on Valentines Day -- too impersonal for me to feel it).  Another has asked to see me 3 weeks in a row.  Another that I haven't even heard from or seen in months calls me out of the blue and wants to get together.  Then there's the one that I've been letting go of for at least a year now, but he still calls and still says he loves me and 10 years from now we'll be married and living better than ever.  Nevermind the fact that I don't take half of any of this interest with a grain of salt.  But, WHY!?  As soon as you tell them no, they're all over you.  Of course I understand the mentality - can't have it so you want it even more.  But, Argh!  And some of these are truly considered friends, if only I could get the sex out of the 'friend'ship.  Working on that...  *Sigh*  I guess I shouldn't complain - its not a bad problem to have I guess.  It could be worse.  But at a time when I really want something true and constant, it makes it hard to stick to one decision.  Hmmm... decisions, decisions.  Diva out.          "
"        I'm Back  Took the day off yesterday and pretended I was a tourist.  I had family visiting from Oregon and West Palm Beach, so we all checked in to a hotel (not the one I work in).  It was fun to be on the other side of the hotel business for a while.  I took two of my cousins (in their late 20's) out on the town on a TUESDAY night.  Yes, there was actually lots to do on a Tuesday night on South Beach.  We started at a bar, then moved over to a hotel and bar owned by Chris Blackwell of Island Records (Bob Marley's manager or something).  Great place with a real smooth vibe.  We ended sitting in the lower part of the bar, slouched down on purple and red cushions with our shoes off listening to spoken word and jazz.    My cousin is convinced that one of the poets was speaking and singing directly to me - and I like her way of thinking.  He was tall, dark and oh, so smooth.  I was encouraged at the end of the evening to go and speak to him.  So I told him I was feeling him and liked what he had to say.  Word.  Great night followed by a great day by the pool with a brilliant February sun shining down on us.  85 degrees, cool breeze and not a cloud in the sky. Even floated in a hammock between two palms trees with my littlest one nestled up next to me.  Completely lost track of time.  But it did come to an end and by 6pm I was back at home with my girls, back in reality.  It was nice, and now I'm back at the office and back at my computer.  The only glowing thing in here is my monitor.  But I do have the remnants of a little sun on my face to remind me of yesterday's dream.  Diva out.         "

"        Pooped  As in exhausted, tired, wiped out.  This Administrative Diva has learned without the shadow of a doubt that I am definitely an office girl.  I racked up almost 30 hours this weekend... in two days.  I worked 30 out of 48 hours this weekend and I am BEAT!  It wasn't very strenous or physical work really.  Just getting stuff done to make sure convention attendees had a good time.  Put place cards on the banquet tables (all 2000 seats!), helped with prepping for the dinner, putting water glasses on tables as there wasn't enough hotel staff to get it all done.  Greeted attendees and handed them their registration and event packets.  Stuffed bags with gifts for nightly deliveries to all 1800 attendees.  Just stuff that needed to be done.  But 14 1/2 hours each day of it, and this Diva is not accustomed to getting up before the sun (4:30am).  It is so difficult to be gorgeous at 5:30am in a lime green uniform top.  Of course, I managed to pull it off and be the fabulous Diva that I am *wink*  But, there was lots of caffeine involved.  And today, I still need caffeine to keep my dry tired little eyes open.  Tomorrow will be better.   Tomorrow I will be visited by my favorite Aunt, her two daughters and another cousin from the West Coast.

"        Valentines Day  Bah - humbug!  Took my girls to an amazing belly dancing performance last night.  It was great, open theater on Lincoln Road - a 'pedestrian mall' with shops and sidewalk cafes.  The speakers were 10 feet high, blasting out Middle Eastern music.  The dancers came out by ones and twos, all glittery with their sequins and body glitter.    It really was so entrancing.  We sat there with about 300 other spectators, clapping and making the required 'la-la-la-la-la-la!' sound, equivalent to the American 'Woooooooooooooo!' or Latin 'Epaaaa!'.  We had such a great time.  And, it was such a joyful night.  Really.  Watching the beauty of the dance filled me with pure energy and joy - it's not really something I can explain or relay to anyone.  Especially through written word.  All I can say it that I'm going to have to get some belly dancing music this weekend, and there will be two little belly dancers writhing and twirling through my living room all next week.  Kala has already selected a few scarves from her dresser for the performance.  And don't be surprised when I tell you all about my first belly dancing class.    Diva out.         "

Well, today he was the subject of a photo for a local newspaper.  He's not normally in the office until around 1pm on Thursdays, so seeing him at 8:30 threw me way off track.  He was waiting for the photographer to arrive.  So picture this:  A very professional hotel executive, grey wool suit, conservative tie and starched white shirt.  Well groomed 40-something trim and good-looking man (I love a man in a suit!).  Barefoot. *huh?*  Then, he stepped waist-deep into our 2nd swimming pool, and waded over to the middle of the pool.  I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.  Yes - in the pool with his shades on, in his suit.  It was so much fun to watch, and everyone around the pool was enjoying the view.  When the shoot was over, the view got even better.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have seen my boss in his underwear.  I may be changed for life.  And, nice package *wink*.  I hope I didn't say that out loud.  Well, Valentines Day may be a wash, but today was so much better.  Oh, yeah.  And now there's some guy named Ah-nold lounging around that same pool.

"        Perfectly Described  Jonathan says: Some people feel that heaven is a cake shop where you can eat as much as you like without putting on weight.

Its a busy place full of excitement and drama. Theres trouble too - and tension. What distinguishes it from normal everyday life? Just one thing. In this other world, your every move works well, your every decision proves wise, your luck ensures that you take it all in your stride.  Yep.  I always say I'm happiest when I am busy.  Gotta have a problem to fix in order to be happy, even if the problem was created by me just so I would have something to fix. *sigh* It's quite an ugly cycle.  Oh, and I'm reading Moliere this week.  Don Juan, The Would-be Gentleman, and The Misanthrope (Miser).  The characters are so overly exaggerated as to be comic, but there's a deep truth in much of it.  It's just beginning to settle in to my understanding, and I feel more and more regret for not attending college.  I would have read most of these years ago had I been a student.    I'm still growing up, and only now beginning to realize some things that others figured out a long long time ago.  Then again, I always did enjoy being the naive little fool that I am when it comes to life.  But, I'm figuring out that there are certain rules that everyone follows.  Rules stink.  Diva out.

"        Munday  *sigh*  I was inspired on Friday to write a lengthy essay on why I want to be 5 years old again.  But the responsibilities of my grown up self deterred me.  I wanted to expound on the freedom and joy of being 5, but the drudgery of single parenthood prevented me.    I want my mommy!  But then, there was the excursion to  urlLink Madame's  gain.

The men's room was broken, so it became a co-ed potty.  But, I've been to New York, so I was fine with it.  Remember Ally McBeal?

After finally falling asleep around midnight, last night/this morning somewhere between 4am (after my little one woke me up to get her a little warm milk to go back to sleep) and 5:30am (when I gave up trying to go back to sleep and sat up to read) I figured that I should be able to create links to blog entries.  And, what do you know, I was right.  Of course that was just one of a million and one items running through my 'monkey mind' before the sun came up.

"        Blog Update  on the Diva Books... no disrespect to the Dalai Lama, but his book is boring.  It reads like an old man rambling.  I was very dissapointed.  I loved the Coehlo book, The Pilgrimage.  I have to read more of his work, it touches on the magic that moves around and through each of us every day.  Very inspiring.  Now, I'm reading Whence the Goddesses, A source book.  This thing is fascinating.  Its more like a text book on Indo-European history and mythology, and it touches on some of the information I already knew on a few classic goddesses, like Athena and Aphrodite.  But it offers so much more details on all of the major goddesses that were worshipped throughout history, up to today.  I'm really enjoying reading it.  I have also picked up a collection of plays by Moliere.  I wanted to read Tartuffe, but the Main Library downtown never has any of the books I'm looking for.  So, I have Don Juan and a few other plays.  I'm looking forward to reading it after the Goddesses.  Now, I have tons of work to do.  My boss took yesterday off, since it was his birthday.

"        Tribute to our newest heroes  Nevermind the fact that they were already heroes before Friday's tragedy.  One radio station here in Miami decided to play music without DJ's, because 'they had a hard time having fun' in the face of the tragedy, and asked that the listeners join them in 'saying a prayer TO our new heroes'.  Not for our heroes, but to them.  Now, they're gods or patron saints I suppose.  Well, they were in the heavens when it happened.    I can't really express what I felt when I actually heard of the tragedy finally on Sunday afternoon -- I avoid media as much as possible.  And, believe it or not, the whole mail truck hi-jack hi-jinx took precedence on the whole 6 minutes that I did watch of Friday night's news.  I am saddened, but am not able to express how.

There's this wonderful path that runs along the ocean, meandering through palm and sea grape trees.  It's gorgeous.  Let me transport you there... I would suggest you close your eyes for this exercise, but then you wouldn't be able to read on.  So, don't.  Pathway of crushed seashells crunches under your feet.  Palm trees stand lazily along the edge of the path, with arms raised to the brilliant blue sky, giggling with the occasional breeze.  Butterflies flutter by and sea birds float overhead.  Ocean waves roll onto the shore, reminding everyone to be respectfully quiet with their shhhhshing.  The warm sun shines down and the breeze makes sure you don't get too warm.  And still the pathway quietly announces your every step.  This is Winter in Miami!    Diva out.         "
"        And later that day...  I received a call today from the father of my children.  I've decided not to call him 'my ex' since I really don't want any connection to him.  Although, 'my child-support check' would be a nice connection, but that isn't happening any time soon.  So, in all of his unemployed glory, he called today to tell me he wants to take the girls to opening day at The Marlins - that's baseball for the sports-impaired reader.  He's a big baseball fan, and always makes a point to take the girls to a game or two during season.  So, it's opening day and he's going to pick up the girls.  'Okay,' I say.  At least he's doing  something  with them, and that's a good thing.  Funny thing is, when he goes to pick up the oldest diva-ette, she doesn't want to go!  She'd rather stay at the Youth Center with her friends, swimming in the pool.  Ha!  So the littlest diva-ette (who really has no say in the matter) goes off with daddy to see The Marlins.  Maybe my oldest daughter is beginning to grow up a little, and daddy isn't quite so perfect?  Or maybe she just prefers the pool to baseball with daddy.  I must admit I found a great deal of satisfaction in this little turn of events, no matter what the cause.  Petty perhaps, but I got a good little snicker out of it nonetheless.  As I've said before, I'm a simple girl with simple needs.  It doesn't take much to make me happy. *grin*  Diva out.          "
"        Ah, Monday  And I'm feeling pretty good.  No explanation for it other than my cold is finally breaking up.  I did a 4-mile walk yesterday along the beach - before the weather turned ugly.   It's so strange, I have a sunburn from yesterday morning, and today, after the terrible storm that tore through here, its 55 degrees.  Last week it was 85, today 55.  Go figure.    I had some friends over on Saturday night to help me polish off a bottle of Cabernet-Merlot.  I made chicken quesadillas that turned out really well - and with guacamole & sour cream... divine!   We had a very laid-back evening and played a little scrabble.  Would you believe they wouldn't let me use 'joie' as a word!  'What's that?,' they said.  'Its French for joy,' I said.  'You can't use French words.  How do you even know how to spell that?!'  After accidently insulting my friend, 'Because I have a brain and know how to spell!' (oops) I explained that what I meant to say was that I use the word often - as in 'joie de vivre' - it's used in English and I read French literature.  They didn't buy it -- the Philistines!  But I still won the game.  *smirk*  And now I'm back at the office and ready to get to work  sort of .    Diva out.         "
"        'Your attention please!'  At 4:10AM, that's what woke me up.  A recording of a man's voice, requesting my attention. 'There has been an emergency reported in the building.  Please take the stairs to your designated exit or to the main lobby.  Do not take the elevators.'  This is exactly what one wants to hear at 4:10 in the morning.  Yep, I'm racing down those stairs in the middle of the night in my jammies just like the man says.  Right.  What I did do is notice that my littlest diva didn't even notice the alarm.  Slept right through it.  I went out onto my balcony to review the situation.  Cool and quiet night, light rain with a chilly breeze.  No firetrucks anywhere around.  No smoke or evidence of chaos.  Of course, the thought did occur that we could be experiencing some sort of bizzare terrorist attack... but that pathetic paranoia faded quickly.  I live in downtown Miami, in a predominantly black neighborhood (yes, the diva lives in 'the hood').  Unless there was some poorly misguided attack, I figured it wasn't really likely.  But the damn thing kept going and going.  I remember seeing an apartment building on fire when I was very little, and the sights and smells of all of that came back to me last night.  I started wondering if I should take flight; pick up sleeping beauty and go down to the lobby to see what's what.  I started wondering what I should preserve should a fireman come knocking on my door.  Where's my purse?  Should I take my tax receipts?  Was there anything besides my daughter and my cosmetics that I couldn't live without?  Then after about 15 minutes the man's voice halted... and I was relieved.  Then it started again.  This stop and start tease went on for another 5 or 10 minutes.  Finally at 4:45am all was quiet and I crawled back into my bed; next to my sleeping diva-ette.  Oh the joys of living in a high-rise.      But as I drifted back to sleep, I did say a little prayer of thanks that it was only a false alarm, and that we were safe and warm in bed.  Sometimes it's good to be reminded of just how lucky you are.    Diva out.          "
"        I finally have something to say about the war   March 26, 2003  Our Correspondent in Iraq  Christopher Allbritton, former AP and New York Daily News reporter, is about to become the Internet's first war correspondent. Allbritton has been collecting donations on his blog, Back To Iraq so that he can travel to Iraqi Kurdistan to report on Gulf War Redux and the occupation to follow. In about six months he has raised $10,318.21 and received donations of equipment from the likes of Panasonic and Iridium.  Chris is responsible to nobody but his readers. He will be filing stories from Iraq through e-mail. His articles will be delivered to 'angel investors'  those who donated to his endeavour  first, and then posted to  urlLink Back To Iraq  for the masses to read. Chris' travels in Iraq will be directed by his readers. Those who have donated will be able to e-mail him and ask him to check out specific things. As long as it's reasonable, Chris will be happy to oblige.  Chris truly is the Internet's first very own correspondent. He isn't hemmed in by a news organization. He isn't beholden to advertisers. He isn't unduly influenced or handcuffed by the embedding process. He will be out there reporting for us, and responsible to no one but us. This is truly a significant moment in the development of the Internet and of 'new media' journalism.   I urge you to check out Back To Iraq and, if you can, donate. Chris leaves for Istanbul tonight.   urlLink Posted by George Paine  From the 'Gulf War Redux' Department as of 09:15 AM  Diva out.          "
"        What are they thinking?  There are 2 new advertising campaigns out right now that, if nothing else, have at least caught my attention.    First of all, there's the new Guess? girl.  At least I think she's new.  I see her every morning on my way to work, on a bus stop ad.  Have you seen this?  She sort of looks like Claudia Schiffer, very Bridgette Bardot-ish; only she's more like the white-trash trailer park version.  I'm not sure what's going on with this one - maybe it's Claudia all washed out and used up?  Is she hard pressed for money or something?  I don't understand.  Maybe Guess? is trying to reach the low income denim wearers of America?  Then there's the new 'Pork, the other white meat' campaign.  Which, now that I see these two together, sort of goes with the trailer park girl. But, I digress.  Familiar quotes and phrases have been twisted to serve pork's purpose.  There's 'Go ahead, make my pork' and 'Time flies when you're having pork'.  It's clever I suppose.  Not really very creative, but catchy.    There's only one problem for me with this.  I have a friend with a very colorful vocabulary and he already uses pork as a replacement for another very colorful word.  You, uh, change the p-o-r to f-u-c and, well... you get the picture.  So, when I read 'Time flies when you're having pork' I'm thinking, 'Yeah. It sure does.  And I could use a little pork right now!' *blush*  Diva out.          "

"        Monday, bah humbug!  If you were to take a look at the past entries for Mondays, you'll see that I am just not a Monday person.  And here we are again.  I had high hopes for another fabulous fun-filled weekend, but all I got was a weekend of being sick and hiding under covers on the sofa.    It started off well enough, with a trip to the salon on Friday afternoon.  Nothing better than an aromatherapy scalp massage and a hairwashing.  Ahh!  Walked out of there feeling all diva-licious, but by the time I got to my office, the humidity had wreaked havoc on my new 'do.  *sigh*  Friday night was lots of fun, with more alcohol than a Diva should consume in one night.  Didn't get out of the bar until 3:30... in the morning.  Sure, that's no big deal for you maybe, but for me... that's practically marathon partying.  I got to play pool, and danced a little and had a genuinely good time.  But I payed for it on Saturday.    That's when the cold that had been threatening to take over finally won.  In my weakened -- or is it weekend *grin* -- condition, the cold conquered all.  I sat motionless on my friend's sofa during a playdate with the little divas, then got into bed around 9pm on Saturday night.  Slept till 2:30pm on Sunday, moved to the sofa, and moved in and out of conciousness the whole day.  Missed my friend's wedding, too.   And today I would really prefer to be back on my sofa, under a blanket.  But, dedicated Diva that I am, I am at work.  I don't know for how long though.  Diva out.          "
"         urlLink Happy Friday!   These questions are sort of thought-provoking.  Almost too much work on a Friday morning!  1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be? I would like to say Albert Einstein, but I don't think we'd have much to talk about - everything he'd say would probably go right over my head.  Maybe Van Gogh would be good to talk to, or Marilyn Monroe.  I bet she'd be cool to hang out with and chat over a martini or two.  2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Hmmm... seems to me the more things change the more they stay the same.  I guess the turn of the 20th Century was an exciting time.  Roaring 20's, industrial revolution and all that jazz.  Yep, early 1900's please.  3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  I really love Miami, but if I had to move I would make sure it was someplace whiere it is always warm, never snows and is near the ocean.  Aruba maybe?  4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?   If I had to be... wait, I already am a fictional character!    Ok, when I'm not the Diva, I'd be Cyrano de Bergerac  5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be? I already look like everyone else.  I always get, 'Aren't you so-and-so's sister?' or, 'Didn't you used to work at blah blah incorporated?' and 'Wow, you look just like what's-her-face famous-lady'.  So, apparently I'm already wearing someone else's face.  Have a fabulous Friday everyone.  And in true Diva fashion, I am planning a big, fun-filled weekend again.  Meeting friends for 3-1 drinks tonight.  Yes, you read that right.  Three for One.  They don't call it Happy Hour for nothin'.

"        Happy Monday is an oxymoron  I'm here, and that's about as much as I can do today.    I did have a great weekend, even better than I expected.  Saturday I went to a Renaissance Fair with a friend.  She was feeling very generous, and insisted I pick out something.  I left with an Irish Cladaugh (spelling?) ring, which I have always wanted.  It was really very nice, and I'll have to go to more of those kinds of events.  Best of all, my friend had free tickets.  I love free.  Saturday night I went out with friends to the opening of a restaurant / lounge.  Very cool place, very chic with all of the 'right' people.  The entire area was an open courtyard, with a huge tiki hut in the middle, serving as the main restaurant & bar.  Several little tikis covered booths along one side of the place, making for very intimate table settings.  Great music and free drinks with the night sky and full moon overhead.  I sipped champagne and danced my ass off and didn't get home until almost 3am.    Sunday I went to a movie with another friend, an advance screening of the new Chris Rock movie 'Head of State'.  Pretty funny with very subtle political satire blended in.  Chris Rock was there for Q&A afterwards.  My friend was in a great mood, the movie was good and Chris was funny.  It was a very entertaining evening.  And, in all, I spent about $3 the whole weekend.  I had to tip the bartender on Saturday night for all the free drinks.  This is how all of my weekends should be!  Fun-filled and free.  Did I mention all of this stuff was free?  I love free.  Diva out.          "
"        Waxing Philosophical  And probably over-analyzing everything again.  However, the thought occurred to me that I don't exactly have the life I would have chosen if I could have chosen one.  Single mom, 2 kids, struggling to make ends meet and to make sense of this life experience.  If I wasn't such a coward, maybe I would just end this tour around the sun and start all over again.  But with my luck I'd come back as a beetle or a cockroach and be crushed in the first few days of my new existence.  Just desserts I'm sure.  But then, I realized that this IS the life I've chosen.  Each decision I've made in my life, no matter how wise or unwise, has formed this existence.  Deciding to have my first child at 23, instead of not having her, put me on this current path.  And sometimes the most inconsequential of acts can have the strongest effect on one's life.  Whether I decided for myself or allowed 'fate' to decide for me, I still chose each step along the way.  I am who I have made myself to be.  So I truly am living the life I have chosen - like it or not.  As I get older, I am trying to pay more attention, to become more mindful of my decisions.  And, in all, I really do like who I am and what my life is.  While it could use a little upgrading in some respects (who couldn't do with a little improvement here and there), I really believe I am the best Diva that I can be.  Onward and upward with a mindful step.  And I won't be coming back as a cockroach!  Maybe a pampered French poodle?  Diva out.          "
"        Happy Friday!    urlLink Friday Five  1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not? Yes.  I especially enjoy talking to my children on the phone when they're away at their grandma's house.  2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone? My youngest daughter, who was sick and stayed at grandma's house yesterday.  3. About how many telephones do you have at home? 1 phone - only my cell.  4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened? 2 encounters.  1 was me, being rude and hanging up on someone.  I told her I had to go, had another line to answer, but she kept wanting to know when I was going to pay some bill.  I tried to be polite and end the conversation, but finally I just had to hang up her.  The other is a man who calls occasionally to speak to my boss at the office.  He asks for him, and before I can even answer that he's out of the office and can I assist him the guy hangs up!  So rude.  5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the person.  I haev a few friends that I don't really want to talk to, as they draw out the conversation and babble on when I have no time.  So an e-mail is quicker.  Other friends I like to babble on with, so its ok to talk.   Sometimes it just depends on what time of day it is.  Looking forward to a fabulous weekend.  Have lots of plans, as a Diva should *wink* - taking my girls to a birthday party at a friend's house, which should be lots of fun - meeting a friend for drinks early evening on Saturday then meeting with even more friends for the opening of a restaurant & lounge with free drinks and great music.  The plan: to Eat, drink and be merry! - on Sunday I have a movie pass for a new movie that will be released soon.  Hope to take a friend.  So, I may have lots to tell you about on Monday, dear reader.  Stay tuned, and have a great weekend yourself!  Diva out.            "

"        Blah Tuesday  Finished reading Madame Bovary last night.  I think it must have been designed to warn young girls of living a frivolous life.  Young woman falls in love, marries.  Then realizes she's not really in love.  Miserable existence, falls in love with another young man.  Resists temptation, continues miserable existence.  Another man meets her, decides he will have her.  And he does.  They have an elicit affair, and she is blissfull for 2 years.  He leaves her, and she almost dies of grief.  Runs into the first young man, falls into an affair with him.  Husband knows nothing about it.   And all the while, she gets herself & husband so far in debt that the officials come to sell her stuff.   In her final moment of desperation, she asks her current lover for help in getting money, he can't.  She goes to her first lover for help, he won't.  Instead of repenting, telling her husband the truth and seeing the error of her ways, she decides to eat arsenic and kill herself.  Husband dies of grief at losing her, their little daughter is left penniless and orphaned.    Nice bedtime story, huh?  No wonder I'm feeling low today.    Diva out.          "
"        Odds and Ends   I'm in a funk today, and feel like I'm not getting anywhere or getting anything done.  Maybe I'm just tired.  Reading 'Madame Bovary', and its really depressing me.  Had 2 strange dreams last night and didn't sleep well in between dreams.    The best part of my weekend was my daughter's 10th birthday.  Nevermind the fact that I'm not old enough to have a 10 year old daughter, and I don't know how she grew so fast.  Anyway, she invited 8 of her little girl friends over - all 9 and 10 years old.  The usual sleepover party: pizza, junk food, ice cream and soda.  The sugar kicked in around 11pm and around 4:30AM I had to remind them to be quiet, since neighbors above and below were probably trying to sleep.  I did manage to sleep a little... I woke up around 6:30am and all was quiet.  They had finally run out of steam.  We had eggs, bacon, waffles and toast for breakfast at 9:30am.  Hit the pool by 10:30am.  By 2:30pm I was wondering when their mothers were going to get there to pick them up!  I think I aged 2 years this weekend, which makes me just about old enough for a 10 year old daughter.  It was fun, but  I won't be doing that again soon.  Diva out.          "

"        There's just no talking to some people   I am not what you would call a religious person.  I tend to keep out of Christian conversations, since I prefer to accept and respect all religions and beliefs.  Whatever works for you, you know?  Well, me and my big mouth.  I recieved this:  (This was a forward worth passing along!)          There is a chance our country may be going to war very soon.  My son and I were talking about numbers the other night.  In scripture, the number 3 represents the Holy Trinity.  I thought of calling for a day of prayer for our country.  When you may ask?  March 3, 2003. It would be 03-03-03.     Wouldn't it be great if all the Christians in the world or at least in our country would stop what they are doing and pray on the same day. We could make 03-03-03 God's Day.  Faith is the doorway that all miracles come through, but prayer is the key that unlocks the door.      What about all stopping activity together at 03:03 in the afternoon?  Then it would be 03-03-03-03-03.  And that won't happen again for another thousand years (in 3003).     I'm marking my calendar for 03-03.   If each of you pass this on to your friends and family, and they in turn to theirs, we could have a powerful prayer time on that date.  Please do your part..   And after some thought, responded like this: Dear All,     I was forwarded this message by one who you forwarded it to.  However well meaning the thought behind the message, I would like to make a suggestion.  Imagine how much more powerful this prayer would be if instead of asking only for Christians to pray, but for all people of all religions to pray.  Belief in prayer makes the difference, no matter whether you are praying to God, El, Buddha, Jehova, Krishna or Mohammed.  Accepting the power of prayer should be more about accepting the power of those who pray, with love and acceptance.  Just a thought to consider on 03/03/03  a world of prayers instead of a Christian sect of prayers could make that much greater a difference.  A few days later, I got THIS:   Excuse me, I am not trying to be rude, but the things that you just said, however 'well meant' are a complete and total lie, and I do not appreciate you forwarding your reply to the people on my list. You said that the power of prayer is 'the power of those that pray' ????!!! O.K. I guess that the murderer that prays to Mohammed, or Allah, Or anyone else, that by the way is dead, buried, and DID NOT rise again, it's o.k. because they are sincere. O.K. and they will be just as sincere when they bomb our country with a nuke right??? You need to think next time before you type. There is only one true God and His name is in the BIBLE. He is the only one that will hear any prayers, and THAT is the truth. I will be praying for your salvation, so that you may spend eternity in Heaven with God. Please feel free to write back. I do not speak these things out of meanness. I truly want you to know the truth. And what you said is as far from the truth as you can get. No one's prayers will be heard if sent to the wrong 'person' Just like if you send a package with no address it will be lost.    It never ceases to amaze me how incensed a 'Christian' becomes when you suggest there may be other valid beliefs out there. *sigh*    Is there no hope for peace?  I respect the zeal behind the response, but ::Murderer praying to Mohhamed:: ??  Please, dear readers, give me some sign of hope here.  What's you're point of view on this?  I would enjoy hearing back on this.  By the way, my response to her:  Well,  it is always good to hear other points of view.  Thank you for sharing yours with me.

"        Grrrrrrrr!  Ok.  The desire to hurt something has come back.  I have been desperately searching for one tiny, inconsequential little piece of paper that I knew I had handed off to someone at least 4 weeks ago.  He, in turn, handed it over to someone else for further processing.  Last week, I was asked about the status of that unimportant little piece of paper - since it was responsible for paying for the entire 4 day stay for a guest travelling from Europe, containing her credit card number, authorization for charges and approval from her bank!    NO ONE COULD FIND THE DAMN THING!  I asked again, please check again and again.  I really don't want to contact this guest and say, 'Oh. Sorry. Yeah, we lost that.  Hope you don't start finding weird charges on your card.  If you do, we had nothing to do with it!'  So, I asked one more time.  And I asked someone else this time, because I wanted to look myself.  Before I had the chance to look myself, this wonderful person informs me that he found the authorization right where it was supposed to be.    SO WHY DIDN'T THE ONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DAMNED LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER KNOW WHERE IT WAS?  A week of fretting and worrying over nothing.   No wonder my eye is ticking along at a regular clip today.  Grrrrrrrrr!  Diva out.          "
"        To Explain my I-Mood  I am not a violent person.  In fact the only person I've ever hit out of anger was my ex-husband, 2 days before I married him.  Should have taken that as a warning.  Anyway, this morning my eye is twitching (a newly developed stress-related twitch) and I am completely on edge.  The thought occurred to me this morning on the way to work that I understand how parents can beat their children.  Not that I condone it or would ever hit my children, but out of sheer exasperation and frustration, I see how it happens.    I wanted to tear wings off flies or kick a dog or something.  Wanted to yell at my children to hurry up and blast my car horn at every driver in my way while I sped down the highway at 70mph this morning.  Some horrible seed of anger has sprouted in me this morning and I don't know why.  And I don't feel sad or anxious.  Actually I feel pretty good today.  And now that I'm at work, I'm calmer.  The room is quiet, my coffee is good and the oatmeal is hot.  It seems to have passed, for now...  Diva out.          "

"        Grrr.... grumble, grumble  Consider that your warning... and let the grumbling begin.  Last night some cretin, or more likely cretins, decided it would be lots of fun to throw empty beer bottles off the balcony.  From waaaaaaay up high.  At about 5:30 in the morning.  I didn't even know what the horrible glass-shattering was.  From under my pillow, it sounded like someone was bowling with beer bottles and getting strikes regularly.   I did finally get back to sleep for a little while, with an occassional score here and there interrupting my zzzz's.  When I got out of bed this morning, I went out onto my own terrace to see if I could find any trace of what exactly had happened.  I discovered on the rooftop two or three floors below me that someone had discarded three empty cases of beer.  So, what, that's like 36 beers?  And strewn across one section of the roof, probably directly below where ever they flew down from, were lots and lots of empty beer bottles.  Some were still entact, some were completely shattered.    Who, on a Tuesday night, can consume 36 beers?  And, why would anyone think it would be fun to toss them over the balcony at 5:30am?

"        Da-da-da!  Su-per Mom!  Regular readers may remember that I live in a high-rise.  30 floors of luxurious diva livin' high in the sky.  And with that luxurious living comes the elevator and all that comes with it.  I've never been too comfortable in these metallic sardine cans, but am always grateful for not having to climb 30 flights of stairs just to do my laundry.  Nonetheless, I worry about getting stuck in the elevator and have already been stuck once, by myself.  I am proud to say I didn't freak out when it finally happened.  But, you know, I never once considered the possibility that I could get stuck in the elevator  with my little divas .  It never once even remotely occurred to me that this could happen.  Never.  It happened.  Last night, while gliding up to our floor, that darling littlest diva - who has a real panache for button pushing - pushed the mail room floor, our floor, and then, just for kicks, pushed the button for another floor already below us.  Well, apparently she confused the hell out of that sardine can, because it didn't know which way to go.  Literally.  The doors closed after the mail room, then bounced.  Then moved up one floor, hesitated and bounced again.  I've experienced this before - ALONE.  And at first, I was upset with my littlest diva for playing with the buttons when I've told her before not to play with the buttons.  Oooh, I was steamed.  Until I looked at her gorgeous little face contorted with fear.  Not just the regular, scared-of-Santey-Claus-won't-sit-on-his-lap fear, no this was genuine, grade A, level one Fear.  The anger bounced out of me in that elevator and Super Mom, here to save the day, appeared.  Suddenly it occurred to me that this is scarey for me - an adult - and it was scarier for my girls.  I soothed and assured, and took charge of the elevator buttons.    The damn thing opened up on the wrong floor - one she hadn't even pushed - and we got out.  After calming everyone down and assuring them that it happens sometimes, it was nobody's fault and that it was okay to be scared, my other little diva (who is brilliant, by the way) suggested we walk to the end of the hall to the other set of elevators on the other end of the building.  So we did, and we went up to our floor in anxious silence, without further incident.  But I will never forget my daughter's face when that damn thing bounced.  She was absolutely terrified and close to panic.  I'm glad I was there, and I'm always amazed at how I am able to react to things when my girls are in need.  Their vulnerability and need somehow make me invincible - they make me Super Mom.     'Cuz, believe me, if I was by myself, I would NOT have been so brave.  Diva out.           "

"       well, I was feeling good.    Then, I had to hear (again) the story of why my colleague doesn't speak to the girlfriend of the man I divorced.  Yes, you know, DBD's bread and butter.  Hey, that's what I'll refer to her as from now on (when I absolutely must add her to this blog), in acroynm form, as typing all of that out takes a lot out of a girl.  So, from henceforth, she shall be known as B&B.  Now, on with our story.  I was reminded of the reason why he doesn't like B&B.  Apparently, B&B was invited to a wedding, when she really should not have been invited at all.  But office politics being what they are... my friend 'bit the bullet' as he says, and invited B&B and DBD.  In the end, and after the final bill was rung up with 8 no shows, it turns out that DBD surprised his little B&B with a flight to the Bahamas for her birthday.  *Here's where that green-eyed monster rears up... he never took ME to the Bahamas.  Then again, I never paid his room and board either.*  So, he never spoke to her or DBD again after being so rudely slighted.  I just love hearing why people hate DBD... and B&B for that matter.  And I know I'm supposed to be over all of that, and I've moved on to much better people, places and things.  But, sometimes, that little monster comes back to gnaw on my insides just a little.  Grrr... money spent on her birthday present should have gone to pay for the welfare of our children instead.  I was living in his mother's bedroom while he was off galivanting around in the Bahamas.

"        Feeling good  I know... its Monday.  But I feel good.  I have been on a cloud since last Thursday, but I'm not ready to share my details on all that just yet.   The weekend was good; productive and enjoyable.  I got up early (!) on Saturday morning, went to a (free) yoga class and then volunteered at the botanical garden here on Miami Beach.  The yoga was very beginners, but sometimes its good to go back to the beginning.  After more than 4 years of practicing Ashtanga, it was refreshing to be reminded of some of the rudimentary basics of yoga.    The garden project was wonderful.  I forgot my work gloves, so I was digging in the dirt with my bare hands, and there is always something energizing about getting dirt under your finger nails.  My group of about 5 or 6 people was assigned to plant new elephant ear plants in a garden bed.  We just sat on the ground, chatting and planting.  It was great, and I can't wait to go back next month.    Easter Sunday was spent at my mother-in-law's house with my two little divas.  And while the mere mention of mother-in-law sends others shrieking into another room, my mother-in-law is really my family and friend.  She spent the early afternoon alternating between hiding plastic eggs around her apartment for the girls to 'hunt' and 'hunting' for eggs that my little one hid for her to find.  I ate WAY too many jelly beans and York peppermint patties, resulting in a sugar headache that would have made even Candy Genius curl up in the fetal position.  Mmmmm, sugar coma!  But the weekend is done, and I'm back at my desk waiting to see what today brings me.  And looking for the return of an IM that I've been missing all week.  Have a fabulous day!  Diva out.

"        DBD's World is about to be rocked!   Extra! Extra! New development in the child support (that is, the lack thereof) from the DBD!    While dropping the littlest diva off at her grandmother's house last night, I noticed an envelope lying in wait for the DBD (dead beat dad for you newcomers).  The only reason I noticed it was the sender's address - The State Attorney's Office.  My most favorite people, his least favorite.  I was so trying to figure out how I could swipe that letter without anyone noticing, then open it and reclose it, and finally replace it on the counter - without anyone noticing it.  I was without inspiration, so it remains, at this very moment, untouched on the counter.  *sigh*  However, I called the State Attorney's office this morning, under the guise of needing to update my address.  I moved in January, so I did really need to update them.  At the end of my call, I mentioned that taunting little envelope that I spied last night, and wondered if I would be getting a copy of whatever notice happened to be encased within.    No.  It went into my file, I was advised.  The notice was only sent to him, she told me, as the notice was a notice of delinquency.  Seems the courts don't like it when you don't play by their rules.  He has had about 6 months to come up with the last $1000 he owes the judge and has not paid up.

"        Who says you can't buy happiness?  Or at least victory.  My oldest diva-ette is now 10.  As a 10 year old, she gets an allowance.  Not a set amount, and not a great amount, but its all hers.  Her only chores, currently, are to take the trash to the trash chute (10 steps from our door) and to attend to her hamster.  I pay her a dollar for each time to takes out the trash, which generally tallies up to $5 a week (once a day during the week).  Sometimes she will offer to do a load of laundry for me or take the dishes out of the dishwasher, which ups the tally by $1 each chore.  I do not offer compensation for cleaning her room or picking up her stuff from around the house; i.e. socks, shoes, clothes, books, markers, dishes, candy wrappers, etc. etc.   I just request that she do it, and do it now.  Whereby, she never fails to say, 'Ok, mommy'... and then never does any of it.  'Oh, I forgot' or 'I didn't hear you' are her pat excuses for when I go into my rant about what she didn't do.  So, now I have a strategy to improve her memory and hearing.  Now, when she forgets or doesn't hear me, it  costs her  a dollar.  At this rate, based on her current earnings, she could owe me big, fast!  This could be the best 'get rich quick' scheme ever designed.    Well, at least it will save me a few dollars in allowance.  And trust me, that dollar is so much more dear to her than it is to me.  When I announced my new plan to my little darling diva, you would think I'd told her I was cutting off a finger for each offense.  She was horror-stricken at the thought of owing ME a dollar!  I've found my mark and hit it directly.    Nevermind restricting her from TV or video games or grounding her.  Nope, money is the center of her universe; well, actually spending it is what brings her joy.  Mostly on candy or the occasional trinket or toy.    Childrearing isn't so much about strict discipline, yelling, ranting, and so on.  You just have to find their 'button'.  Children have an inherent knowledge of each parent's button - find theirs and the world is yours!  Diva out.         "

"        Weekend Update  I just got pics from the AIDS Walk on Sunday.  It was a great day for a walk.  The sun was shining and the air was cool; never broke a sweat.  Just strolled along very nicely and chatted the entire time. I'm going to put the link to the Snapfish album I created, in case anyone cares to see it.  It may or may not work.  Thank you to my readers who were kind enough to donate to the cause.  My team raised over $1000 for Care Resource and the event, on last tally, had raised over 75K in all, and still growing.   urlLink AIDS WALK Miami 2003   After that little 3 mile stroll I stopped at the Farmer's Market on Lincoln Road.  If you ever find yourself on Miami Beach on a Sunday, you really should check it out.  Fresh fruits and flowers, the best baked bread I've ever tasted, and lots and lots of art and antiques.  And with a Starbucks Coffee on practically every block, you'll have no shortage of caffeine to fuel your day.  Then, once I was home I decided to take another short walk - yes walk - over to the Museum and Library downtown.  I live about 3 blocks away, and as I said before, the weather was just perfect for walking.  Saw a very thought-provoking exhibit by Shirin Neshat on the roles of men and women in Islamic Iran.  Also picked up 2 new books to read:  Dickens and Shakespeare.  Finished off the day with a lovely nap on the sofa.    Just love those Sunday afternoon naps!  I couldn't live without them.  So, in all it was a very pleasant weekend.  Hope yours was just as nice.  Diva out.           "
"         urlLink Top Ten Driving Tips for Miami    1.  Lane dividing lines and crosswalk markings are only suggestions and do not require to be followed explicitly.  Basically, no one pays any attention to these.  2.  Turning signals also fall under the category as Tip #1.  Either they don't get used at all, or the left signal will remain blinking for the next 20 miles.  As indicated above, basically, no one pays any attention to these.  3.  Yellow means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.'  4.  Red means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible before on-coming traffic gets there.'  5.  Green sometimes means, 'Let's wait and see what color comes next!'  6.  One way streets invariably will have some jerk driving down them the other way, while blaring his horn and blaming you for paying attention to the street signs and dividing lines. *See tip #1*  7.  While travelling south in the far right lane, the car ahead of you suddenly decides to make a left U-turn (no signal required), across two lanes of southbound traffic. Then, defying on-coming northbound traffic, the driver travels across those 'suggested' lane dividers to the farthest northbound lane.  What should you do as he arbitrarily travels across 4 lanes of moving traffic?   Answer:  Nothing.   Just keep driving; slight amazement at this everyday act is allowed, but not required.  8.  Never expect anyone to ever stop at a stop sign or to yield the right of way.  Ever.  9.  When driving late at night, all rules are off.  Traffic lights are often shut down after 10pm (especially in my neighborhood) to promote 'safety' in the streets.  Generally, this means that red, yellow and green all mean the same thing: 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.' *Note: this tip is only slightly different from our previous tip on red lights.  This is because there is generally not any on-coming traffic in the 'hood at 10pm.  The occasional slow-moving pimp-mobile or cop car, but not much else.*  10. When the bum on the corner offers to clean your windshield for a dollar, save him the effort and just give him the dollar.  You have NO IDEA what could be in that bottle of liquid, and you probably don't want it on your car!  Diva out.           "

"        Never Never Land  I've been subjected to watching Peter Pan twice a day, every day this week.  No, its not some strange and unusual form of punishment; my littlest diva is obsessed with the movie this week.  You know how little kids get, they need to watch the same thing over and over again until they know all the words and all the scary parts lose their scariness.  And we're not talking the Disney animated version here --oh no.  This is the 1950's(?) NBC televised live performance with Mary Martin.  It's quite good and very entertaining.  The songs stick in your head for days - you can trust me on this one.  But, after about the 4th or 5th time, my grown-up cynicism reared its ugly head and I started to see Peter Pan in a whole new light.  Actually, I started to see a few of the men that I've either dated or married personified in Mary Martin's character. *ugh!*  'I won't grow up!' 'I want to stay a boy forever!' 'He wants me to always do his spring-cleaning!' 'Can you tell stories, and tuck me in at night, and mend my pockets?'  Typical; the girl asks 'What are your exact feelings for me?'  How many times have we said that, ladies?!  At least he responds honestly, in all his boyish charm,'That of a devoted son for his mother.'  And then, at the end, Wendy's grown too old for Peter, so he invites the younger Jane to fly away with him instead.  It's all just a classic bed-time story after all, but under the glaring eyes of adulthood, its all a little too real.  Tonight, I think we'll have to pick some other movie to watch.  Unfortunately, if its another childhood fairy tale, I'm sure I'll find some fatal flaw in whatever we select.  Diva out.          "

"        Feeling Lucky   There's been a lot of noise lately about America and Americans and the American Way.  Well, my friends, all I have to say is I feel really freakin' lucky to be American right now.  I work with a woman from Peru who has been in the US for several years under Political Asylum.  All of a sudden, Peru isn't considered a dangerous country, and Political Asylum just doesn't fly anymore.  So, she and her husband have been told that their work visas are no longer valid, effective immediately.  She and her husband have 60 days to 'find a new country.'

"        And now for today's real entry  What I really wanted to talk about today is my newest hobby.    I bought a bottle of Woolite over the weekend.  I'd been wanting to buy some, but haven't been able to find it in my grocery store.  It wasn't with the laundry detergents or the household cleaners, so I figured they just didn't carry it (heathens!).  I found it in some other aisle, near dishwasher detergents I think.  Or maybe it was with the bar soaps.  Once I found the elusive concoction, I had to decide on the big bottle or the little bottle.  I opted for the little one, but am beginning to realize my mistake.  Should've gone for the Jumbo bottle.  Now that I have acquired this magic elixir, I have been Wooliting everything I can get my hands on.  I've hand washed the cushions on my sofa, a dry clean only skirt and one of my favorite suits.  This particular suit is about 4 years old and while it does still look great, I just don't have much faith in dry cleaning.  After 4 years of dry cleaning, I felt the suit should see a little water - at least once in its lifetime.  Needless to say, the jacket is still drying - the bottle instructed me to 'lay flat to dry'.   Still drying.  But now, I'm looking around the house, wondering what else I can Woolite.  Decorative pillows and bath rugs beckon.  I may even put a little in the baby's bath water tonight.  And then instruct her to 'lay flat to dry.'  May be the most peace and quiet I've had in days.

"        Miscellaneous Observations  First of all, many thanks to my readers who have made a donation for the AIDS Walk this Sunday.  I'm walking a little over 3 miles and have raised more than my goal of $100.  And for the first time in doing this sort of thing, I think that's pretty darn good!  If you feel the need to do some good, there's still time to  urlLink Support Your Diva!    Observation:  None of my most intimate male friends *wink wink* have made any donations.  As always, the most supportive males in my life are not the ones I have, um... 'relations' with.   Why is that?      As far as I can tell, they don't even read my blog.  Wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to read?  Hmmph.   Observation:  I've come to the realization that I am very content just the way things are.  Well, money is still an issue, but I'm not lonely or in need of male companionship.  For a while there I was thinking 'Poor Diva.  All alone in the world without a man to call her own.'  BAH!  Over that! I curled up in my big queen-size bed last night, snuggled up to my huggie pillow and felt very content as I drifted off to sleep.  It was a very good feeling.  Of course now that I'm happiest without a man, they'll all start crawling out of the woodwork again.  That's pretty much how that works.  They just can't stand to see you happy!    Observation:  I read on a blog the other day, I think it was on 'Was it the Pagan Remark?' about a little man bashing.  Just a little.  Nevermind how very strongly I agreed with just about all of it.  I started having thoughts of my own.   * Younger men who like older woman haven't had any of the experiences yet always think they know everything. * I'm tired of men who need coddling.  These men either always have an excuse for why they didn't or couldn't do what they were supposed to do, poor babies.  In the meantime, I'm getting it done.  No excuses.  Make it happen.  But they just can't.  And there seem to be more than a few men like this around me.  It's becoming annoying.   Observation:  I've been so concerned about treating my youngest diva with nuturing love, as a baby that I've sort of overlooked my oldest little diva.  I've always had a tendency to treat her more like an adult than a child, and lately I'm seeing that she needs a little more nuturing.  She's growing up; maybe that's why I'm noticing.    Ok.  Observations over for now.  I feel like I should say something very wise and philosophical right now, but all I can think of is, 'I need another cup of coffee.'   Hmm... go thee out and seek thy coffee.   There.  Wise and philosophical.  Diva out.              "
"        Back at work  I had a whole 3 days off.  I didn't abandon my little blog or my lovely readers, I just wasn't around to update.

And, among the 183 e-mails this morning, this one was my favorite.  Subject:  The copy machine is heartbroken...  The copy machine did not make it over the weekend without hearing from you. Could you please come and see it.   The sad part is, this is the most romantic message I've received in MONTHS. *sigh*  And even sadder, I couldn't fix the machine this morning... not even my touch was enough to make it all better.

It's the tree of life from which you tap the sap. You know what you want and you know how to reasonably get it.  Virtues: You respect people with plans. When someone has their head on their shoulders, you know that they can see straightforward and keep their eyes on the mark. When it comes to looking at the future, you take a logical approach: what's within your ability? A fortunate attribute that you have is the ability to set a goal for yourself, higher than maybe you feel possible, but still keep yourself within reasonable bounds. You take the time to appreciate those surrounding you and they do appreciate you in return. Decision-making comes naturally to you when you take the time to consider each option. People only come to talk to you when they are looking for a logical, reasonable solution.  Aspirations: You have an idea of what you can do with your life, but you push it up a notch. You need a profession that you can enjoy, so work towards it. You want to live near your friends and family while being as far away as possible. You also want to settle down while working in excitement and variation.  Quirks: You don't appreciate drama queens and they don't appreciate you. When they need help, they won't seek you out because of your ability to see through their overly dramatic predicaments. You have leeway for humor, and sometimes love to participate in it, but when it becomes irrational behavior, others can count you out. Loud noises are bothersome, except when they come from you or your friends.  Factors: Reach for the sky! Don't decide to do something because you're merely good at it, but choose something you might like to do, despite whether you're sure you can master it or not. Don't only save room for a few empathetic friends, but open up to everyone.  Future: When looking for a job, if you work in all of your talents (logic, decision-making, planning, and definitely humor), you'll find yourself happy. Come to a compromise for location; live nearby your friends and take periodic vacations or live farther away and take frequent return trips.  * * *  I don't think this is me.  I'm a little more 'by the seat of my pants' than this... and planning?  Ha!  Oh well.  So much for tests.  Diva out.            "
"        Friday!  So much to say and do.    Let's see, first of all... last night's dinner was fabulous.  The seared scallop paired with the Carneros Cuvee 1991 was amazing, and the Oddysey paired with the Veal and Truffle jus... divine.  It was an amazing dinner, and quite an enjoyable evening all together.   Having the French Ambassador's party dining just a few feet away added to the fab-ness of the evening.  (No, really ~ the French Ambassador was there!)  This weekend is busy.  Going to the salon tomorrow to get my brows shaped; want to look my best for the Big Apple.  And I'm going to a Kabbalah course - on interpreting dreams on Sunday.  Meeting a friend for brunch on the north of the beach, and then going together to this course.  If nothing else, it should be interesting if not enlightening.  And at some point I have to take my two little divas to the see the newest Disney animated film, 'Finding Nemo'.

What do you most want to be remembered for? ~ My ridiculously, shall we stay retarded, unrealistic optimism?  2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life? ~ 'There's more than one way to do everything.'  If I can't figure out a way to get what I want or need, I try looking at it from a different angle; there's always a way.  Or, 'To thine own self be true.'  3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year? ~ Getting a grip on my budget while still managing to keep a roof over my head, and the heads of my little divas.   4. What about the past ten years?   Bringing my girls into the world, and watching them grow.  They truly are my pride and joy.   After reading that, I reconsidered.  My girls aren't an achievement, more of a blessing.  Acheivements from the past 10 years would be learning to love unconditionally, learning to be strong and stand up for myself, learning how to take care of myself and to love myself unconditionally.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  ~ 'Nevermind what people say.  Believe what you know in your own heart to be true.'  I've had to say that more than once to my girls lately.    Diva out.          "
"        A toast to optimism... I'll drink to that!  The internet is e x c r u t i a t i n g l y  s l o w  today.  It takes forever for a page to open, so that by the time it does open, I've forgotten why I was going there in the first place.   *bleh*  It's rainy and gray outside again.  Just another day in paradise... NOT!  And, to complete my day, I have the Wine Club Dinner tonight.  The first dinner I've done since last November, which was a great success with 100 guests.  That dinner benefitted the Boys & Girls Club of South Florida.  Tonight's dinner doesn't benefit anyone, not even me considering there are only 14 guests expected.  That's including me, the Wine rep and his guest.  *bleh again*  But, still, it should be a good night - if we don't get rained out.  14 people sitting at one great big table, conversing over glasses of Gloria Ferrer Chardonnay and Carneros Cuvee 1991, whilst nibbling on Roast Capon and Veal Medallions.  Tres yummy.  And the Wine rep will be giving out goodie bags and bottles of wine to take home.  Since there are so few attending, he can do this little extra something special.  So, more is not always better.  And, as always, I am trying to be optimistic and sunny in the face of adversity.  Besides, there's nothing a little good vino can't cure!  Diva out.          "

"        Happy Friday!   Memorial Day Weekend is here, and on South Beach that means a new kind of chaos.  Locals know to stay away, and even certain upscale parties have learned this very important lesson.  At least one of the weekend's parties has moved to downtown Miami, opting out on South Beach.  And, believe me, despite the controversy and all the talk, it has more to do with the mass quantity of people than it has to do with what kind of people are here.  We're talking gridlock, crowding, road rage... and that's on the sidewalks!  Wall to wall people strolling up and down Collins Avenue.  Driving two blocks takes 15 minutes ~ no really.  Although, this year may not be as crowded.  Several hotels are still not sold out.  And while the city hopes the crowds won't come en masse, the hotels, restaurants, clubs and shops hope they will come.  This is the last big weekend of high season for Miami ~ when we make our money ~ and we all need to make budget for May.  We count on this weekend to make budget.  If we don't do it this weekend, we just won't do it.  So, for the next three days ALL police officers are on 12 hour shifts, the 'God Squad' walks the streets 24/7, all hotel managers are living on property, bars are stocked, streets are cleaned, staff are braced.

"        Terrorist Attack?  Or public service?  After all,  urlLink the explosion  went off just as law students were completing their final exams.  Maybe someone was just trying to prevent a new onslaught of even more lawyers.  (heh heh)  On a personal note, I'm having a very weird 'doom and gloom' feeling lately.  I feel like I may finally be very very close to a great happiness, a lifelong joy.  And now I feel like I'm not going to live long enough to receive it.  Yesterday I was caught walking between two city busses, ** Eliz, your comments yesterday regarding busses came to mind at that moment - very weird**.  I almost got side-swiped while driving home, tripped several times while walking (that's nothing new actually) and my daughters were freaking me out by running and jumping into the deep end of the pool.  It was too much, I had to get upstairs into my safe little home and cocoon myself there.  Today, there was an accident a few cars ahead of me, so I just missed that one.  Its just that I really feel like I'm finally making really good decisions in my life, walking on the right path, and my trip to NY will take me further along that path and closer to a really good man.  So now I'm afraid I'm never going to make it to NY.   And today we're on high alert.  I get on a plane in 15 days, and we're on high alert.  Isn't that special?  *sigh*  Diva out.           "

Happy Monday Everybody!   Yes, I am uncharacteristically happy today, and it has everything to do with my weekend.  A friend that I haven't really seen in maybe 4 or 5 years came to Miami for the weekend.  She and her roommate kept me so busy with fun that I hardly had time to sleep.  It was such a great weekend, its amazing what a few good friends and a little dancing can do for a girl.  Friday night we attended the Ocean Drive May Issue Launch Party at a very trendy and chic South Beach hotel ~ I was in this month's issue so it was only right that I attend ;)  Then, on Saturday night I got a few more old friends together and had a group of 4 of us together for the first time in 7 years.  The last picture in my  urlLink gallery  shows you just how good it was to be together.  And, just one more reason for my current state of ecstasy... I bought a ticket to New York on Saturday.  This is a very long overdue trip, and will be a sort of mini-vacation for me.  Can't wait, and I'll probably put up some sort of countdown if I can find some free countdown online to help with that.    Hope you had a great weekend, too, dear reader.  Of course, it couldn't possibly have been nearly as fabulous as mine, because after all, you're not the Diva, I am ;)  Diva out!             "
"        Gifts received  I had the amazing experience of watching the lunar eclipse last night.  I raised a glass to toast the great goddess before her face was hidden in the earth's shadow.  I sat for about 35 minutes on my terrace with an awesome view of the whole celestial event.  Even got my opera glasses out to get a better view.  I had to wait 33 years to see my first lunar eclipse, and it was worth it.  I also had an interesting thought this morning, while waiting for the rain to pass so I could walk the two blocks from the parking lot to my office.  I forgot my umbrella at home.  I realized two things; first of all, I remembered that old addage, 'Into every life a little rain must fall'.  Believe me, its been falling for about 2 years now ~ but then I was reminded that, it doesn't fall forever.  The rain passes soon, and life goes on.  The other thing that came to me is this: While you don't have to be prepared for everything that life throws your way, you may have to be prepared to wait until it passes.  Happy Friday everyone.    Diva out.   and one more thing... I recently heard that China is considering passing a law that if you are considered to be spreading SARS to others  by going outside when sick, you will be executed.

"        Monday  Feeling pretty good, for no good reason.  Had a decent weekend; went downtown to Miami Art Museum and the Main Library on Saturday with my kids.  It was family day at the Museum, which means free entry for families and activities for the children.  It was a good day in all.    Saturday was also the May Day project.  It started bad and ended bad.  My camera eats batteries at a ridiculous rate.  I was able to click off 6 pictures when the newly bought batteries gave out.  I was short on cash, so was unable to get more batteries.  You can see my pathetic attempt at my  urlLink May 10th Gallery .    I'll try to be better prepared for the next project.  Sunday was uneventful.  Picked up the little divas from their grandma's house; they had roses and a card for me.

"         urlLink Happy Friday Everyone!    1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  ~~ Relatively organized.  I live by the rule: A place for everything, and everything in its place.  2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  ~~ I do have an organizer, and update it whenever something new (bill, event, etc) comes up.  3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  ~~ Hmmm... orderly disorder would best describe it.  4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  ~~ No - can't be bothered.  I'm not anal or anything!  5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  ~~ My life after my divorce!  Weekend plans are beginning to form.  Last weekend I walked 4 miles across a causeway connecting Miami to Miami Beach.  Very peaceful walk, and I plan to do it again this weekend.  Also want to check out a new Wine & Champagne Bar that just opened up on the beach.  I'll let you know how it all turns out ~ Have a great weekend!  One other thought before I go... someone commented this morning on how quickly the days are flying by.  We're already to the middle of May!  But then I considered this: time does fly, and before you know it this year will be over, and so will the next ten that follow this one.  That is why we must make every day count for something.  Otherwise, just let them fly by.  If you can't be bothered to make this one count, why should you care about the next one?    Diva out.           "

"        Not a family bed!  I don't know how they do it.  I'm friends with a married couple that do that whole 'family bed' thing.  You know, the WHOLE family shares one great big bed.  Mom, Dad and all the kids cozied up together.  Well, I am definitely not one of those people, and I certainly do not have a great big bed.  Unfortunately, my children do not understand this.  I've gotten used to the 4 year old climbing into my queen-size bed with me maybe 3 nights out of the week.   But last night, my 10 year old daughter crawled into bed with me around 2am.  I was like 'Uh-uh! what do you think you're doing?!'  She had a bad dream and I reluctanly gave in with a sigh.  But then, about an hour later the other one crept in as well.  So there I was, sandwiched between the two of them.  Do you have any idea how wild a child sleeps???   Hands flopping everywhere (mostly across me), legs kicking (mostly my legs) and hair falling where it may (mostly on my face!).    When the alarm sounded at 7am, I said in my cheeriest morning voice, 'That's it.  Everybody out!  Get up!'    After yesterday's sleepless night, this was just one more sleepless night.  I may have to learn how to function on 4 or 5 hours of sleep at a time.  Oh, how I need a nap! For now, I'm off to get another coca-cola...  Diva out.           "
"        MoNdAy  And, of course, I'm feeling out of sorts.  My littlest diva turned 4 yesterday, and MIL threw a nice 'little' party for her.  We ended up moving the party to the park, since we were expecting 21 adults with their children.  And this is just her immediate family!  Gotta' love those tight-knit Latin families.    Had the excrutiatingly unpleasant experience of sharing the party with DBD and B&B.  Yes, he brought her to the party, after all she pays for everything he does and has, so she may as well come along.  I was very surprised at how soothing chanting can be.  'OM' helped me through the day, and eventually I just forgot about her and had a great time anyway.  I would like to think that my apparent ease and comfort at the party really bugged her.  I still have some work to do on digging out my little anger seed in regards to those two.  I didn't sleep well last night, but it had nothing to do with that.  The party exhausted me - it really was a fun day - and so I should have been able to sleep.  I was doing pretty good until 4am when something shattered downstairs.  Sounded like a plate-glass window was completely shattered.  The noise startled me out of a pretty good sleep, and then the train passed by, and soon every little bump, shuffle, and sigh kept me awake.   Around 5:30 I considered getting out of bed, but decided to give it another try.  I was really close to sleep when the train passed again - it does so every half hour starting at 4:30am.  I did finally get back to sleep, just in time to get up.    I almost cried this morning when I heard on the radio that the Metrorail will begin 24-hour service in June.  Diva out.           "

"        Random Thoughts and Simple Joys  Why is that, when I was in my twenties I could eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every day, and managed to weigh about 20 lbs less than I do now.  There's no Ben & Jerry's in my diet now, shouldn't I be magically rewarded for NOT indulging?  Hmmm... maybe I should go back to my old habits... maybe not.  Last night I was rewarded with a few simple joys - the ones in life that really count.    First, while rocking the littlest diva off to sleep last night she was fighting sleep with all she had in her.  But, of course, Mr. Sandman won in the end.  But, during her valiant fight, I watched as her eyes fought to stay open... her eyelids fluttered shut and then opened wide, just to fall half-closed again.  That simple flutter gave me such joy that a laugh started way down in my heart and rose up in my throat.  Before I could help myself I laughed out loud and woke her up a little.    Then, after putting her into her little bed, I sat down next to my older diva-ette for our bedtime chat.  She was updating her calendar planner that I gave her for Christmas.  I noticed a picture of Teddy Roosevelt on the bottom corner of a page, and asked her if she knew who he was.  She hesitated, so I tried to give her a clue by asking if she knew what his job had been.  Her lips sealed up tight, and then she said, 'Yes'.  That was it, just 'Yes.' with this sly little grin.  We both knew she had no idea, and that shared knowledge made me laugh.  'Liar!' I teased and tickled her.  Filled her in on the minor details, thinking that someday she'll learn more about President Theodore Roosevelt and, hopefully, remember our little exchange.  Those are things to be treasured... the flutter of an eyelid, a sly little smirk, a shared secret.  That's what makes my life so cherished... good thing I'm such a simple girl.  With all my troubles and worries that I have, I'm still one of the richest people I know.  Diva out.          "

"        Ouch!  Still on the theme of sainthood, I think I earned my wings the other night.

She, being the wonderful and adorable child that she is, immediately turned into a wild, screaming and scratching beast in protest to my unreasonable demand.  I ended up carrying her off like some deranged and rabid animal, with her digging her fingernails into my shoulder and raking them across my shoulderblade and down the back my arm.  So I did what any loving and patient mother would do.  I dropped her.  Not carelessly or violently of course, but I placed her on her feet by my side, and took firm grasp of her arm as I lead her inside.  She continued her protest by screaming and crying - you'd think  I  had scratcher  her .

"        The Saintliness of Diva   When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?  I alternately wanted to be either an artist or a nun.  No kidding.    Some days I would make drawings, create little picture books, and doodle endlessly with the idea that one day I would use my god-given talent to create great works of art.  Other days I would drape a towel over my hair and, instead of pretending it was long flowing locks, would imagine myself in a nuns habit.  I wondered how I would look as one of gods servants.  I wasnt even Catholic.  Of course, it never occurred to me that I could possibly do both  be an artist and a servant.  Some people figured that out and created great works of art devoted to their faith and religion.  I guess it just wasnt meant for me.  These days, I dont paint or draw.  Although I've got plenty of servitude going on while I'm raising my children.  And believe me, there are plenty of days when I achieve sainthood, simply by not killing them during those more trying times.  Diva out.            "

"        Huge Success  The Wine Club event was wonderful.  I had about 89 guests show up, and most of them paid (12 comps out of 89 isn't too bad).  I just love it when lots of people show up for an event; I turn into this super-human social butterfly.  Shaking hands, smiling, welcoming everyone to the party ~ you'd think it was MY party.  And in a way it is.  I got to sample a really wonderful white wine from Spain last night - I carried my glassful around all night long, nursing it for over an hour.  I'm taking a bottle of it home tonight if there's any left.  I'm thinking a little sushi and a glass or two of the white wine will finish my week off quite nicely.    I even got to do a TV interview last night.  That's right, I've graduated from print to television.  I'm not quite sure how its going to turn out and I'm not sure I want to see it when it does air.  We'll see... that may be my limit on those 15 minutes of fame. ;)  Heading out for a very quiet weekend (I hope).  Have a fabulous weekend for me!  Diva out.           "

And, besides the wine tasting event, there's going to be a performance in our pool.    'Making a splash this summer, Momentum Dance Company will perform Water Study and Plunge at the National Hotel, in our famous Infinity Pool.  Performance begins at 7pm, and then immediately following this special presentation, The Wine Club presents its summer wine spectacular, featuring seasonal favorites like Zaca Mesa Viognier, Benton Lane Pinot Noir, Rene Mure Gewurztraminer, Mas de Bressades Grenache and other cool, crisp selections.  All wines will be perfectly complemented by Chef Greg McDaniels French fusion inspired hors doeuvres.'    Sounds good, huh?  I'll let you know tomorrow.  Cheers!  Diva out.           "
"        NCY Details   Brief synopsis: My hotel was in Midtown Manhattan, so I had immediate access to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park and more. MoMa Queens - saw works from true masters like Cezanne, Dali, Van Gogh (Starry Starry Night!) and Gauguin... just to name a few. Rockefeller Center - gorgeous example of true Art Deco style St. Patrick's Cathedral - arches overhead were breathtaking Radio City Music Hall - people were lining up outside to watch arrivals for the Tony Awards Washington Square - it was late, we saw the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.  It was strange to watch Miami on the screen in New York China Town - the best Chinese food I've ever had, and my friend ordered in Chinese; it doesn't get more authentic than that! Puerto Rican Day Parade - so much fun with great music and dancing  Saw an authentic NYC rat - running along the subway track - yuck!  I took more pictures of the parade than I needed to; the edited version of my pictures (if you haven't already checked them out) is  urlLink here .  No pics of the diva this time, maybe next time.  I want to go back in August, before my girls go back to school.  Travelling is just easier that way.    I could get used to luxury hotel life; I was so disappointed last night when I got home from work to see that the maid forgot to do turndown on my bed!

"        Absence makes the heart grow fonder   And as much as i love my family, the longer I'm absent, the better.  I remember now why I live in Miami, so very far away.  But, isn't that what growing up is about?  You know; growing up, moving away and unlearning all the wrong things your parents taught you.   You've come a long way, baby.  I head out again tomorrow.  I'm taking the Cherahola Skyway - the scenic route - through the Cherokee National Forest.  This road will lead me into Cherokee, NC where we will stop to visit the Cherokee Bear Zoo.  In Downtown Cherokee. *grin*  According to my father, his grandmother was (at least part) Cherokee, so this will be like visiting my roots; learning about my heritage.  Only with cheap souvenirs and caged 'bears, big cats and monkeys.'  Fun and educational, as the tourist brochure points out.  Then its on to Savannah.  The Hostesss City of the South.  I'm about half way through my book, and I can't wait to see the squares that are described.  We're staying on a hotel on River Street.  The River Street Inn, as a matter of fact.  We get handmade chocolates and Godiva Hot Chocolate at night.   Ooooooh, you know how I feel about turndown.  Fred had intended to leave chocolates on our pillows at the Ranch.

"        greetings from NE Tennessee  I tried several times yesterday to see my blog with no luck.  Maybe blogger was down?  Anyway, I was able to see my site this morning, and it feels like home.  As weird as it might be, I've missed checking the other blogs on my blogroll.  And I was anxious to hear my posts.  I'm concerned that by mingling with all these country folk I may pick up the accent.  My nephews have it real bad, so bad that sometimes I can't understand what they're saying.  They've lived in unpopulated areas all of their lives.  Bluff City, where we are now, is the most populated area they've ever experienced.  And everyone here has varying levels of southern drawl.  It grows on you, and if you live in it long enough you pick it up.  Like a foreign language.    So, I was pleased to hear my audblog posts this morning and find that I haven't succumbed to the drawl.  I have always worked hard to keep my speech free of any identifying accents or drawls.  I'm just plain ol' diva, from nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  Everyone asks me where I'm from because they really can't tell from my speech and I like that.  Anyway, I'm having a really good time.  This is my first vacation in 7 years and for once, I'm the one sending the postcards.  I always ask travelling friends to bring me back a postcard.  Now I'm the one doing the travelling and it's nice for a change.  Tomorrow we're going to the Ripley's Aquarium in Knoxville - downtown Knoxville of course.  There's this huge tank with a tunnel you walk through that takes you under the fish and sharks.  Should be cool... maybe I could do an audblog post from under there.  Have to try that.

"        busy busy day  gearing up for my road trip now.  i tried to resist paying bills, but some i just had to pay, so now i will have less money than i planned for.  but i know how to work a budget and stretch a dollar like the toughest yoga asana, so i know i'll be ok.  thinking happy thoughts and looking forward to hitting the road.  but today i'm in the office with oh so many projects to complete before i go.  so, just a quick post today and then i'll get down to business.  i just wanted to comment on how multi-cultural my girls are.  i have noticed that they have so many different friends from so many races and religions, and it makes me happy.  I never knew any muslim kids, or taiwanese/chinese kids, or catholic kids or even african-american kids.  i grew up in the new era of bussing and desegregation but there was very little socializing done among the different races.  the closest i ever got to diversity was my italian/american cousins and even they lived very far away.  its encouraging for me to see my children playing with other children just because they have fun together.  and sometimes i get to share a little knowledge and teach a little tolerance.  last night, my oldest diva overheard someone talking religion by the pool.  he was talking about jesus to some muslim kids, and my daughter said, 'Muslims don't believe in god.'  I briefly explained the small differences between the two religions.  that little optimist in me can't help but believe that if i can teach my children they may teach their children.  eventually, we will all understand that we are all one.  ok.  gotta get some work done.  diva out.

"        Munday  Ok, so the holiday wasn't so bad.  Worked a few hours in the AM, then went shopping!  Can you believe Burdines actually gave me a credit card?  I was shocked.  Then I shopped.  I needed a few things for my upcoming road trip, and Burdines was kind enough to foot the bill... for a little while.   It's actually part of a bigger plan for me as I hope to buy a place to call my own in the next few years.  Building my credit is required, and this is a step in the right direction.  Getting to shop is just an added bonus ;)  Spent the late afternoon to evening on the beach with about 50,000 strangers, and of course my little divas and my in-law family.  A collection of grown ups, divorced and not dating - kind of sad actually.  What's sadder is that I'm part of that group *sigh*  But we had fun, and the fireworks show was one of the best I've seen yet (they do keep getting better and better).  And for a minute or two I relaxed and had fun.    Then the pyromaniac jerks started firing up everything they could get their hands on - bottle rockets, firecrackers, jumping jacks, blah blah blah.  No consideration for the throngs of people surrounding them, the children running barefoot in the sand, the people relaxing close by.   The paranoid mom in me reared her ugly head and we got the hell out of there before some sand dune caught fire.    Then of course there was the 45 minutes of traffic to contend with.  But at least the littlest diva in the backseat fell fast asleep, so the wait was a quiet one.

"        Happy Fourth  I'm not feeling exceptionally patriotic right now.  This never was my favorite holiday.  And this year, all the 'pops' and 'booms' just make wonder what it was like in Bagdad earlier this year, and still.  It's not just noise there.  I've always considered it strange that we would recreate a war scene to celebrate our independence.  Because, that's what the fireworks remind me of; one big boom and instantly my mind is crouched down in a foxhole somewhere, - rat-a-tat-tat - trying to stay alive.  I must have died in combat as a soldier in a previous life, because images of war and violence are just too real and scary for me.  But, my children are fortunate enough to not suffer from this overactive imagination, and they love the gleaming streaming colors in the night sky.  So, I'll watch their faces light up with delight and try not to think all those horrible ugly thoughts.  'Being touched by one's children is a delight to the body, And listening to them chatter is a joy to the ear.' -Tirukkural 65  I have my family and I have more material things and personal freedoms than so many in this world.

"        Stepping up to the soapbox  Yes, I'm in that kind of a mood today.  Read on if you like, and if you don't... ok.  I just have to say that if I hear one more newscaster report how more and more Americans are overweight, and how the FDA is stepping up and getting stricter on food labels... yada yada yada.  I'm going to throw a food pyramid and start screaming expletive RDA's at somebody!  Almost nobody I know actually reads the labels, and if they do they're looking for the one thing their doctor told them to watch out for.  Watch your sodium or watch your cholesterol.  Come on, do you really look at the back of that Oreo package to count fat grams before scarfing down the whole damn box?  Trans fats?  Yeah, whatever.  Americans are infamous for blaming everyone else for what's wrong with them.  Don't blame McDonalds for serving you a bigger burger and more fries.   If you get in your car and drive there (most of the time we don't even expend any energy to get OUT of the car - they bring the food to your car), and if you order the super-size fries and the double cheeseburger with bacon and the super-size DIET coke, then how is it their fault that you devour the whole damn thing before you even make it back home to flop down on the sofa for a nap?    Screw the food pyramid, I want my Haagen Daaz Caffe Mocha Frappe Ice Cream NOW!    Most Americans over eat and under exercise. Period.  A nice 20 or 30 minute walk at lunch time, smaller portions and more water make such a difference in the quality and length of a lifetime.  If you gotta have the Oreos, then swim a lap in the pool tomorrow.  If you're planning for a big dinner, have a light lunch.    Its easy to make the change, but its easier still to put the blame on someone else and continue to complain about how your pants don't fit like they used to.   *Diva now humbly steps down from her soapbox*   Diva out.

"        Worst comb-over ever  Last night I saw that the new Merriam Webster dictionary is out, and includes 10,000 new words.  Words that we use every day, but have never found in any dictionary ever before.  Words like hip hop, wack, dope and phat.  Also the word comb-over has been added.  When I saw that, I was instantly reminded of the worst comb-over I've ever seen.  Actually it was pretty recently, maybe just a week or two ago.  On Lincoln Road on South Beach, where everyone strives to be their absolute most fabulous at all times.  He was obviously from the Elvis-era.  He was in relatively good shape, considering his apparent age - I'm guessing late 50's to early 60's.  I can't even remember what he was wearing, since I was blinded by his comb-over.    Picture this if you dare:  Snow-white, Elvis side-burns, down the sides of his face to below the ears.  Then brushed w-a-y back,  over his ears  so that the ends met at the back of his mostly BALD head.   )(     As if we're not supposed to notice that he has no other hair except his sideburns.  Guys, please, if you're losing your hair and you're considering the comb-over... don't.  Go the way of MJ and Sean Connery, and just speed up nature's process by going bald.  Shave as you ruin nature's cruel joke with a mocking laugh at destiny, or be proud of your waning hairline.  Just be brave about the whole aging thing.  We women have to deal with vericose veins and sagging boobs.  You have hair loss.  Deal with it.  Diva out.           "
"        Decisions, decisions  Okay, so on the one hand I have an upcoming 2 weeks of vacation and a paycheck to blow.  On the other hand, I have an ever-inceasing debt due to the daycare.  About the amount of one paycheck at this point.  So, pay the bills or have fun?  Believe it or not, I'm actually not sure what to do.  I've got my whole trip planned, and people are excited and anxious for the arrival of the diva and her little divas.  And, after 4 years of really crappy stress and hard work, I believe I deserve a great vacation.  But, there's this little conscience jerk whispering in my ear that I really should get caught up on this bill.  It would be the right thing to do.  So, I'm working on ignoring the whisper and figuring out how to pay the bill as soon as I get back! *sigh*  I really hate being a grown up.  On a happier note,  my little jet-setter diva returns home today!  I can't wait to see her, she's probably grown 4 inches since I last saw - a whole 12 days ago.  Yay! She's home, she's home.  Of course her little sister isn't nearly as excited as I am.  She has really enjoyed being an only child for a while.  Also, I'm doing something nice for someone I care about today.  I can't wait till he gets my little surprise.  I love doing nice things for people I care about.  Diva out.           "
"        Mars Mania  Have you had a chance to see Mars yet?  It's so close to the earth right now that its just screaming 'Look at Me!' up there in the night sky.  Other than the moon and one or two constellations, it's just about the only celestial object I can identify.  And now its even easier to find.    I took a few moments to contemplate the red planet last night from my balcony, and i started to get a little nervous about what it's close proximity may portend.  All the astrologers are buzzing with the possibilities, while the astronomers are just happy to get such an upclose look.  Here's something i found this morning online.  Haven't had time to read it yet, but thought i'd share it with you.  From  urlLink Beliefnet.com .  I've already had a whirlwind of a day and my emotions have gone haywire.

"        'You can do this.'  That's what I told my littlest diva this morning, when the tears started welling up in her big brown eyes.  We sat nose to nose; me squatted down on the red, yellow and blue rug, her perched precariously on the edge of her very small pre-k chair.  'You're brave and strong, and I know you can do this.'  She looked at me, chin quivering, and said, 'No I can't.  I can't do this, Mommy.'  I almost lost it.  I was being the brave and reassuring mommy, introducing her to the classroom, reminding her that this is just like daycare.  Telling her how her day would be busy with new faces and places and that, while it may be a little scary now, tomorrow would be better.  And I would see her this evening and she should tell me all about it.  Then I walked out of there with her with Grandma as back up.  Grandma had met us there this morning with camera in hand for this very important first day.  One diva-ette to 5th grade, one to pre-K.  Big day.  I left the class room with its miniature tables and chairs, primary colored alphabet and number charts, smiling faces and not smiling faces, with my littlest diva progressing from a whimper to a howl as I closed the door behind me.

"        Friday!!!!  woo-hoo!  yeah!  hooray!!!!  the only reason i'm so excited about today being friday is that today i pick up my little divas and bring them home.  not just for the weekend, but for good.    they've been staying with their grandmother, my mother-in-law, for the past 4 weeks.  and while it may sound nice to have a break from motherhood, i haven't really enjoyed it.  instead i've been working 10 hours a day in the office and then going home and straight to bed.  turns out i actually like being a mom.  who knew?  so my girls are coming home tonight, and we have the whole weekend together before school starts on monday.  i'm planning on indulging them in any way i can.  ice cream for dinner?  ok.  hit the pool before breakfast?  sure, let's go.  i just want to soak them in again; i'm so glad they're coming home.  and my littlest diva is all registered for pre-k - its so exciting!  i'm going to get her some uniforms today and we already bought the new school supplies.  i think i'm just as excited about the new school year as my girls.  so, no more working long long hours, no more going home to an empty apartment.  just my everyday, boring life as a single mom - just the way i like it.  have a fabulous weekend everyone - i'm looking forward to mine.  diva out.

"        Lights Out  Terrorism?  I think not.    urlLink Doc  is there, and think he tripped barefoot on the plug!  :P  But, really, what is it more than just a huge inconvenience?  Let's see... no lights, no a/c, no hot water for a shower, no stove to cook, no fridge.  Eating ravioli and tuna fish out of the can, drinking bottled water and warm coke.  Reading for entertainment, or listening to a battery-powered radio.  Why does this seem so familiar to me?  Oh, wait! I know, because of a little thing called Hurricane Andrew a few years ago.    No power for a week or more for some.  I didn't have hot water for about 3 weeks, but hey, a cold shower in August isn't a bad thing.    And, placed side by side with what happened on 911 or what Iraq experienced as a result of 911, this is just not as bad.  No one died in an attack, no one lost a home or family member (although some may now due to the heat or medical concerns).    It is a huge inconvenience, but fortunately not a huge tragedy.  And, helloooo - 3 day weekend.  I'm workin' here!  Don't hate me because I have perspective, people.  And really, you've got to give NY'ers credit.  They're a tough group of people who come through everything in style.  So, this is just one more thing they've lived to tell about.  Diva out.           "

"        School Daze  Okay, so the title for this post isn't exactly original.  Give me a D for creativity.  I went to register my littlest diva for pre-k today.  I thought I was going to sign her up for the city program, run out of a pavillion at a park.  I figured for $50 a month, it could be a good thing.  Except the program ends at 2pm, without an afterschool program.  And there's nobody around to take her to the public school 'afterschool' program just across the street.  So, I walked myself across the street and checked out the public pre-k program.  Yes there's space available, and no it doesn't matter that I don't live in their district.  I guess at $85 a week, they don't care where you live.  If you can afford it, your kid can attend it.    So, on the one hand I will be paying a fortune for what should be free (and will be in about 3 years), and on the other hand, I won't have to leave work everyday to walk my child across the street.  Convenience costs.  Now I have to buy the uniforms that go along with this public pre-k.  The good news is my oldest diva goes to the same public school (its actually very good), and some of her uniform tops may be handed down to our newest pre-k student.  I just have to tack on a couple hundred dollars to my already very expensive August.  Come on, tax credit!  Diva out.           "
"        IM Etiquette  Considering the current trend over at  urlLink frenchy's , I should probably be asking her this.  When using IM, how long do you wait before deciding that you are being intenionally ignored?  Is it rude to send a message when someone has the status set at 'busy'?  Should you expect a response, if the status is 'busy'?  And if you send a note to someone who is 'busy' and they NEVER respond, should you assume that you are being ignored?  It took me a while to master certain social standards in the human world.  Modern cyber etiquette may take me forever to figure out.  *sigh*  Diva out.           "
"        Culture Club  Tonight, I'm going to see a French film accompanied by a light picnic.  I've been invited as a result of my last Wine Club event.  I worked with the Miami Beach Film Society on my last event, so now they've invited me to this event at their newly opened Cinemateque.  I'm so excited - mostly because this event will be free for me.  Tomorrow, I'll take my girls to the Miami Art Museum for family day.  Also a free event.   Followed by the library - that's right... free.  I just love that I am able to soak up so much culture for free.  Also, its just been decided that we are going to take advantage of a city-wide cultural program called Artists in Residence.  We will exhibit the work of 8 artists staying on Miami Beach for the month of August and use the mailing lists of three large organizations in addition to my own.  Art, culture, wine and hors d'oeuvres.  Who could ask for more - and we should expect about 300 guests (a record for my Wine Club events).  We'll hold an event sponsored by the city, and for once the attendees will be paying to attend!  I'm so excited about this event that I can't wait to get to work on it.    Life at work is good, and the fringe benefits that come with it help keep me smiling.   Have a fabulous weekend!  Diva out.           "

"        That's interesting   Well, friends, after having seen 'Pirates of the Caribbean' last night, I have to say that the quiz down there was right.  I am most like Jack Sparrow.  I mean, you know, without the heavy black eye makeup, the braided goatee, the gold teeth and the really dirty fingernails *yuck*.  And I'm not quite as quircky as that character.  At least I don't think I am; although some of my friends may argue that point.  But there are many similarities; for example people will often underestimate my capabilities.  And god knows I get by on more luck than strategy.  I do have a tendency to wax verbose and poetic, and I have a very deep-seated faith in my self and in who I am.  I genuinely believe that as long as I stay focused on my goal, I will achieve it.  Its completely unthinkable that I won't finally get exactly what I want.  And then there's that whole lust for freedom that we share.  The movie had its strengths and weaknesses.  Also, being a Disney movie, it couldn't help but poke fun at the ride at Disney World.  The little dog with the key outside the cell... that's in the movie.  And Capt. Jack Sparrow makes a clever joke about the dog - but not everyone in the theater laughed.  Maybe they've never been.    I laughed a lot, and I left there feeling really good.  That's what a movie should do, I think.  I felt elated and free when I walked out of the theater; sort of like Jack in the closing scene as he stood at the helm and headed for the horizon.  Diva out.            "
"        My day was better  Just when you think things are rough, you find out someone else has it rougher.  I spoke with DBD this morning to find out when I can expect my first child support payment from his new job.  He informed me that he wasn't sure, but that I would be receiving something very soon, since he was arrested over the weekend.  What!  Yup.  DBD went to jail over the weekend.  He was stopped while driving and as there was a warrant out for his arrest, he was taken into custody.  He had to borrow $1000 - exactly what he's owed the judge for purge for almost a year - to get himself out of jail.  I feel bad that it went that far.  I never really wanted him to be arrested.  But, he could have borrowed the damn money when he got the notice of contempt a few months ago.  Avoiding his responsibilities finally caught up with him.    The amazing thing is that no one in his family told me about this.  I was there all day Saturday and not one person said anything.    So, at least I should be able to get my car out of the shop soon.  What he had to pay to get out will come directly to me - and it should do so very soon.  Diva out.           "
"        An Epiphany  Fred, you probably should stop reading this right now. I know how you hate it when I get philosophical.  But I had an epiphany last night.  I was practicing yoga and almost ready to go into the rest pose when it hit me.  I've always said that pain is a warning, but I never really fully understood that, until last night.   I didn't hurt myself or anything.  I was sitting with my legs (almost) in lotus, with my forehead resting on the floor.  And I had this urge in the back of my head to sit up.  I resisted as long as I could, but then I realized that I needed to sit up.  The urge was strong enough to push me up.    In that position, I always think about being a seed buried deep in the dirt.  What makes it want to grow?  It must be that urge to rise.  The hunger and need to change and grow.  You know how an old pair of shoes can just start to hurt?  Time for new ones.  Or when those size 6 jeans just don't fit anymore?  Time to acknowledge there's been a change, and react with a change of jeans.    On a deeper level, sometimes when we feel like something just isn't right it's because we need to grow, to make a change.  The hard part isn't only noticing the hurt, but also figuring out what's causing the hurt.  Discovering what needs to change can be so very hard.  But, once you figure it out, the ache goes away.  That little urge inside you, bugging the hell out of you, quiets down and goes away when you've taken the right action and made the right change.  Everything changes, and when we don't change too, it just hurts.  Diva out.            "

"        The Word of the Day   navel-gazing \NAY-vul-GAY-zing\ noun   : useless or excessive self-contemplation    Example sentence: Instead of more of the feel-good lyrics and beats that launched her to stardom, the songs on the diva's sophomore release border on tedious philosophizing and navel-gazing.    Did you know? If you are scratching your head over something, then you are probably in a state of puzzled contemplation. But if you are staring at your navel, you could either be indulging in some useless self-contemplation or in a state of deep meditation. If the latter, the technical term for your activity would be 'omphaloskepsis,' which is a form of meditation that has been practiced by mystics for centuries. Navel-gazing is a pop form of omphaloskepsis that is devoid of any serious meditative value. The word has been used more or less depreciatingly since its first appearance in 1963.

"        Little Miss Know-it-all   Last night my littlest diva announced that she knows everything.  Of course, I, in my infinite wisdom and understanding, explained to her gently that she can't know  everything , no one knows  everything .  Then my other diva-ette began quizzing her, 'Oh.  You know everything?  Ok, so what's 2 + 2?'    Then they went back and forth with tests of knowledge.  I just smiled and enjoyed the happy chatter and banter.  This morning when I dropped her off at class, what's the first thing I hear from another mother?  'Your daughter knows everything! She always has the answers to all my questions, she's little miss 4-1-1.'  So, apparently I was wrong.  She does know  everything .    Diva out.           "
"        My babies are growing up *sob*   This morning, the littlest diva announced that she wanted her big sister to take her to class.  Not her mommy, her sister.  I was dumbfounded; I responded with something like, 'Really?  Are you sure?'  She was sure alright.  So instead of parking and walking her to class, I pulled into the drop off lane along side the school.  I was still in disbelief, but they popped off their seatbelts, gathered their things and hopped out.  I had to beg for a goodbye kiss from the little one - she was already half way out the door.    I watched with tears welling up as the two of them walked hand in hand into the school, the littlest one's lunchbag dangling down past her knees because she's just so small.  If I had a camera I would have clicked off a picture of this; the day my diva-ettes worked together without me to guide them.    WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Diva out.         "
"        Munday  Not such a bad monday, as monday's go.  Called the Child Support Division bright and early this morning to find out the status of that bond payment DBD payed at the beginning of August.  Still waiting on that nice little chunk of change and wanted to know when I could expect it in my pocket.  Turns out whoever was supposed to set the court date didn't set the court date.  Now the lady I spoke to has to contact the legal department to get the date set.  I can't get my grubby little hands on that money until the judge releases it to me.  i'm thinking some little date-setter had a nice little shopping spree with my money!  Anyway, it would appear that I now have the wheels in motion, and maybe I'll get a notice in the mail or something.

"        Back in Happy Mode  I was feeling a little off kilter for a few days, but I'm back to my old happy self again.  It never takes long... to paraphrase a song I hear last night, You can't keep a good girl down!  Went to see the new Woody Allen film last night.  Its only the 2nd or 3rd movie of his that I've seen, but I really really liked it.   I love his selection of music in this movie, and his sense of humor is slightly more dark and twisted than usual (if that's possible).  There were some really creative shots and extremely subtle jokes, and the solo performed by Stockard Channing was moving and sad, to say the least.    Woody's looking pretty old these days, but maybe that was part of the character.  It was hard to tell, because he was pretty much playing himself in this one.  I'm no expert on Woody Allen thoughy, so you go check it out and let me know what you think.  Also, I heard an amazing vocalist last night. After the (Free) movie I went to a (free) live performance of a man who calls himself  urlLink Big Brooklyn Red .  He has a voice that reminded me of sunlight glinting on a pool of water.  Honestly.  When he sang, his voice went from just a regular sound with strong urban influence to this powerful, smooth and clear truth.  After singing three songs, he said he had run out of material.  I thought, 'What! this guy only has 3 songs?!  Then he asked someone to suggest a theme, and he'll sing about it.  IMPROVISATIONAL SONGWRITING.  It was amazing.  Someone yelled out, 'Black Power!'.   Everyone laughed.  Not at the subject matter, but at the implications it represented.   Big Brooklyn Red is a slightly rounded, average height caucasion, ruddy complexion with blond hair twisted into a braid, laying lifeless down his back.  Very cool shades cover his, probably blue, eyes from the bright stage lights.  But, he did it.  It was phenomenal how the band jammed together on a completely improv'ed beat and tune, and then he picked up with lyrics that he gathered from the air around him.  One of his lines included, 'I've been every color, black, white, brown and yellow' and he spoke of how he understands so much more than a white man should, and the chorus was something about 'Whites rock and roll, why don't you just stay easy.  All that black power, gonna make you greasy.'  It was gritty with a funky Shaft kind of groove, and the crowd was overwhelmed by this white man in shades.    At least I know I was.

"        Bonus Blog   Diva innocently answers phone - mistake #1: 'Hello, may I help you?'  Crazy lady at other end, 'Yes.  I received a message from Joe Schmoe saying that supposedly he works for your hotel and arranges hotel accommodations for production and movie industry clients, and supposedly he is planning a trip to LA and is setting appointments to meet with potential clients.'  Poor trusting and clueless Diva responds, 'Yes. That's right.  Joe does work for us and he is planning his trip to LA.  How can I help you?'  Crazy Lady: 'I want to know how he got my number!'  Innocent Diva: 'Oh.  Well, I don't know, but he may have gotten it from an Industry Directory.  He's never been to LA before and he's very excited about meeting with industry clients in that area.   Are you involved in the production industry?'  Crazy Lady: 'No, I'm not.'  Diva: 'Oh.  Well, then its possible he misdialed.'  Crazy Lady: 'No. I don't think so.  I want to know how he got my number.'   .  Diva, trying to find a clue here: 'Did he address you by name in his message?'  Crazy Lady, taking every piece of info she can get, 'Yes, I think he did.  How did he get my number? I want to know how he got my cell phone number!'  Diva, still trying to be helpful: 'I'm sorry but I don't know how he got your number.  Would you like to speak to him?'  Crazy Lady: 'Yes, I would'.  Diva tries to transfer call, but Joe Schmoe is not at his desk and the voicemail picks up.  A smart Diva would have sent Crazy Lady into Voicemail Nirvana, but instead she goes back to the caller.  This is mistake #2.  Diva: 'I'm sorry, but Mr. Schmoe is not at his desk and I'm getting his voicemail.  If you'd like, I can take your information and investigate this for you.'  Crazy Lady: 'Yes, that's fine.  And can I call you back for the details?'  Diva: 'If you will give me your name and number and the company you work for, I can find out for you and call you back.'  Crazy Lady: 'No, that's ok.  I don't want to give you my number.'  Diva, 'Who am I speaking with?'  Crazy Lady pauses deviously:'...Kimberly.  And nevermind, I'll find this out my own way!'

"        Ignorance is Bliss   If thats the case, then there are lots of really happy people out there.  I occasionally experience an oblivious person on the street; you know, that guy who doesnt realize anyone else exists in the world.  But, Ive had three such run-ins in the past 6 or 7 days so now Im starting to get a little peeved.  Last week, after I made a left and began to merge into the right lane for a right turn, I discovered that the lady to my right had done the exact same thing.  Only, my turn was legal.  She made a left turn from the middle lane, to my right and then slowed to make the same right turn.  There was no one behind me, so I was able to stop dead in the road and wait for this oblivious woman to make her turn; I then merged right to make my right turn.  If I had been as oblivious as her, I would have merged right INTO her, instead of behind her.  She drove on, never realizing what had happened.  Then, yesterday I made a U-turn so that I could park my car at a meter; a van behind me did the same.  I pulled up behind a lady who was backing into a parallel space and waited for her to pull ahead into the space in front of her.  The van sat behind me, waiting for me waiting for her.  We both assumed that this lady knew we were behind her, waiting on her.  Instead, she remained in the 2nd space instead of pulling ahead to the first space.  I had to back up a little so that I could then maneuver my car into the space behind her, causing the van to back up to make room for me to back up, and then the van had to do the whole thing behind me.  And she never even realized what she had caused  she was oblivious.  Then, this morning, in that same damn left turn, merge into right lane turn (I do this each morning), a man turned left from the turning lane as he should.  But, instead of merging to the right as soon as he could, he waited until he was at the right turn.  I was already in the right lane, getting ready to make the right, when this guy veers into the right lane without signaling, cutting me off as he makes the right turn.  I had to brake, then turn.  He just drove on, oblivious.  Maybe Im just too sensitive to these things right now; maybe these things are reminders to me to be more aware.  Im sure they are reminders for me to avoid anger and act with loving kindness (something Im always working on!).  My question is, how do people live so mindlessly every day?  Its sad and frightening for me to consider that people can just bowl through every day without ever looking up from the edge of their noses to see whats going on around them.  Living mindfully is something that I strive for every day and part of that, to me, means being aware of your surroundings and being aware of your actions.    So, today, I must ask you, my dear reader, to be mindful.  Just for today, stop and consider whats going on around you.  Look before you change a lane or turn a corner.  Think about what youre going to say before you say it.  Chew your food.  Taste your coffee.  Be aware of the air you breathe and the space you occupy.  Please, just for one day, for me.  And Ill try a little harder today, too.  Thanks.  Diva out.             "
"        I love Jonathon Cainer  This man is brilliant... how he does it I just don't know, but he is always so on it!   Tuesday, 9th September 2003  SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   For a long time you have been living in hope. A change is on the way. This ought to be good news but you find it slightly disturbing. Somehow, in your effort to make a waiting process bearable, you have managed to make it comfortable. Indeed, you have settled so well into your psychological seat that you no longer feel inclined to get out of it. You have not forgotten what it was you were hoping for, but you now see that, if a dream really is to become a reality, awkward adjustments must be made. Indeed they will. But you won't regret this.   Millions may not understand, but believe me; on this one he is so right its scary.  Has something to do with the sing-song a few entries down and I'm still too superstitious to really say much about it.  I just hope that he's referring to what I think/hope he's referring to.

"        Munday  Had a very relaxing weekend.  The little divas went to Grandma's so I got to sleep in on Saturday and Sunday - nothing more delicious than sleeping in on the weekends.  My hair is back to a rich brown - sans gray - espresso was the name on the box.  so, after a few extra hours of beauty sleep and a dip in dye, I'm feeling most fabulous once again.  Why, I may even paint my toenails tonight!  Ooh, such decadence.  And littlest diva's pre-k teacher came up with a great way of avoiding the morning separation anxiety drama that we've all been subjected to for two weeks now.  Instead of prying her off my leg as I attempt to escape the classroom, the teacher meets us in the cafeteria.  This way, there is a smoother transition from daughter to student.  And you know what?  It works!  I left that little girl in her blue and beige uniform, with tweety bird lunchbox slung across her shoulder, hand in hand with her teacher.  Bye, baby... kiss kiss.  And out the door I went.  No drama, no tears.  Life is good.   ** one note - i've been visiting the blogs that I know and love, and have tried leaving comments.

And, a note on the beliefnet.com article on Mars that I listed below.  It's not very good.  So if you haven't read it yet, don't bother.  They managed to confuse the Mercury retrograde with the Mars retrograde (both of which are occurring right now).  Life has slowed down a bit, thanks to the retrogrades - but maybe just for me.  So much is going on around me that I almost feel like I'm sitting in the eye of a storm.  Considering we're deep in hurricane season now (weatherwise, that is), let's hope that I don't end up in an actual storm... that's something I do NOT need right now.  Diva out.         "
"        Happy Halloween!   I'm struggling today with a bad attitude.    I'm surrounded by people who never celebrated Halloween as children (or as adults even), so they lack the traditionalism that I have as an American celebrating this very American holiday.  For me, a pumpkin carving contest should focus on carving the pumpkin.  But not so here.  Here, they dress them up as waiters and maids - full life-size bodies with a pumpkin for a head.  That's more of a scarecrow than a pumpkin as far as I'm concerned.  They look great, but they're not really jack-o-lanterns.  And I refuse to give in; I spent more than an hour scooping and carving on Wednesday night, so that my pumpkin is a close rendition of a  urlLink Tamara de Lempicka painting of two women's faces .  I did it because I wanted to see if I could.  Tamara de Lempicka is the hotel's 'patroness' and we have several of her paintings hanging.  Our restaurant is named after her.   Of course there's also this horrible little hope that I could win some cash for my efforts.  But then I remember who I work with.  People from other cultures who don't get the traditional meaning of 'carved'.  I'm a traditionalist, and I guess I'll end up suffering for my art.   urlLink But I did it  - it looks good and I'm satisfied with my art.  So, Happy Halloween everyone - traditional or not :P  Diva out    PS - Update on the pumpkin - I actually won 2nd place and $50 for my efforts! Yay!         "

"        Oy Vey Am I tired!  Last night I went to a Jewish Wedding.  An orthodox Jewish wedding, where girls sit on one side and boys sit on the other.  It was my first wedding of this faith, and it was nice.  I was a little surprised when the Rabbi starting singing, with three little old men as back up singers to his right.    I probably would have enjoyed the ceremony more had it not been completely in French.  And i got there about 45 minutes late.  It took two hours to trek over to Hialeah to drop off the girls at grandma's house.    But, I had fun at the reception.  I danced the hourah (i know i misspelled that one!) and watched as my friend, the bride, was lifted high above everyone's heads in the 'chair of honor'.  And there was a great mix of American and French music over several decades.  I danced, I ate, I laughed.    Going home afterwards was not fun.   I got stopped about a block from my house since the lights on the left side of my car don't work.  I don't know why, they just don't.  After informing me of all my faults, and asking if my children are buckled up, he ran my license and found that I'm an honest citizen.  He let me go home, telling me to get my lights fixed.    After getting in around 2am, I think I got about 3 hours of good sleep, what with the full stomach and my littlest diva tossing and turning in bed beside me.

"        Whoooosh  My horoscope warned that things would speed up in the end of October, and changes would come.  But I wasn't really prepared for all of this.  My neck hurts, literally, from all the changes going on around me.  I'm so tense, and that's just not like me.  I laid in bed last night trying to find a comfortable spot in my pillow - my neck and shoulders were so tense it hurt to lie still.  I mean, its good that things are moving along again, after the long slow Mercury retrograde last month, but...  Life is just a blur right now.  To wit:  My boss, who used to travel between two hotels, just informed everyone that he will no longer traverse between the two.  He stays here, a new GM goes there.  Which means the pressure will be on me all 40 hours of every work week.  People are getting hired and fired so fast that I feel like I'm working in a new place myself.

"        Revitalized  My service-mindedness has returned, and Im feeling energized again.  Much of this is due to the weekend I had and several messages I received during the past two days.  I got up early and volunteered at The Botanical Garden again.  I always enjoy the time spent puttering around in the dirt, beautifying the garden and doing good for Mother Nature.  I shared my concerns about getting a team together at work for a big volunteer project on November 1st and the lack of interest and teamwork I experience in the office.  Someone reminded me that you cant make people want to help, just offer the opportunity and hope that they get involved.  Then, at church on Sunday, the message was all about partnership in service.  What service means and how it means different things to different people and why some people just dont get involved.  Someone else spoke on how to energize yourself after doing service for others.  Last night I attended an Appreciation Dinner hosted by the Dragon Boat Race Committee and I received a certificate for my efforts at the event last weekend.  I was touched by the consideration, and the food was really good.  Toward the end of the evening, the volunteer coordinator commented on how his faith had been restored after witnessing the willingness of people to get involved and help out.    He took the words right out of my mouth.  Im working on getting a team together for Hands On Miami Day and will plan an appreciation luncheon right afterwards.

"        Big Day in the Lobby   I've seen some pretty interesting things in our hotel's main lobby.  After all, we're here on South Beach, and things are always pretty interesting.  But, today was definitely a red letter day.  Earlier today I went out to the lobby for something or other, and ran into the Power Puff Girls.  No, really.  The Power Puff Girls , and that monkey Mojo Jojo.  Big as life, standing in the lobby for some group that focuses on children's programs in Latin America.  As if that weren't enough, I just witnessed a wedding at the Concierge lobby.  Not the meaningless ceremony with dress and cake, etc.  But the signing of the Marriage License for a wedding ceremony that happened here on Sunday.  Because, let's face it, you can do all the ceremonies you want.  Without that signed piece of paper its all meaningless.  So, as I was witnessing the signing, I signed as a witness on the license.

"        Lost  I have somehow lost my sense of service recently, and don't know where to find it.  I am always happy to assist with any event, charity or fund-raiser and was always the team leader to organize groups here at work to get involved.  But, after trying to encourage involvement here at work in so many events to no avail, I'm starting to feel discouraged.  After my choice for location was not accepted, I have backed away from planning the employee holiday party.  My idea of the party was that it could be held in a lovely botanical garden at night, here on Miami Beach.  Outside in December in Miami is wonderful weather, generally temperatures range anywhere from 60 to 75 degrees.  We wouldn't have to pay a rental fee, saving $1500 on our limited budget.  Minimal decoration would be needed, leaving more money for food and prizes for staff.  But, someone on the committee is concerned about rain, and wants to find an indoor venue.  One that will cost more money and probably not provide the quality of food that we would get at the Garden.  This person had nothing good to say about our last employee function, but couldn't provide any good input or alternatives.  I just don't want to work with her now.  I'm not going to form a team for Hands On Miami Day on November 1st.  The last time I got involved, it was just me and one of the owner's daughters.  It was embarrassing to see that a company of 500 could only muster the energy of 2.  No one is interested, so I'm not wasting my time with them.  I'll be at Hands On Miami Day, but I'm not working to get a team together.  And I'm not even sure I want to get the two hotels involved in the Toys for Tots program this year, since there was very little participation when we did it two years ago.  But, I'm volunteering for any pick up sites that may need help.  So, maybe I haven't lost my sense of service, just my interest in getting the people that I work with involved in things they don't want to do.  I have so many other things that I can spend my energy on.  What's that bibilical saying about not throwing pearls to the pigs?  Something like that.   I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and maybe I need to get my heart back in the right place.  But for now, I just want to stick to this non-involvement.  Maybe I'm just pouting, or maybe I'm growing up a little.  Diva out.           "

"        Sights & Sounds, part Deux  After listening to my own audio blog, I figured maybe I should explain some of the sounds you hear in that entry.  As the boats approach, you begin to hear a single drum beat, repeated over and over.  Then, there's the steerer, calling the strokes, 1 - 2 - 3...  As the boats get nearer to the finish line, the announcer is cheering on the teams, and encouraging the onlookers to cheer them on as well.  Then, near the end of the entry, there's the finish line caller, watching the line and calling out the boats as they cross the finish, 1! 2! 3!.  It's really very exciting, from the anxious waiting for the race to begin to the final moment when the last boat crosses the finish.

"        The Dragons are coming!   For some reason, there is an increase in Asian culture in Miami.  And I couldn't be happier.  I'm volunteering this weekend with the  urlLink First Annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival  this weekend.  I'll be behind the performance stage, doing whatever they need me to do.  Hope I can actually see the boats from where I'm stationed.  I'm looking forward to the exciting races, with the deep beating of drums urging paddlers to row faster.  I'm also looking to the food and merchandise.  I'm hoping to find a relatively inexpensive Kwan Yin statue for my altar at home.  And its really hard to find good Chinese food, so maybe this will be a very  tasty  event.  And, I must confess, I am looking forward to all of the Asian men.  My Asian boyfriend in NY sounded just a little jealous when he pointed out this very obvious benefit to this particular event.  I do like Asian men *blushing slightly*.

"        FTAA in my 'hood   Last night, while attempting to get home, I had to sit in about 20 minutes of stop and go traffic.  It took that long for me to travel one block.  All I needed to do was make a right and then go to the light 1/2 a block away and make a left, to go around the closed road leading into Downtown Miami.  20 minutes.  And in that 20 minutes I saw maybe 30 cops in riot gear, guns and all.  A little unsettling, but all was quiet on the homefront, so I figured the unsettling presence was getting the job done.  4 helicopters overhead and a whole fleet of cop cars wasn't hurting matters any either.

"        I'm just a girl  Sometimes I forget that.  I had visions of grandeur this weekend as I walked through the aisles of the discount auto parts store.  I thought, 'I can do this!'  I wanted to save money so I figured I could put oil and coolant into my car, change the air and oil filters, and pick up a steering wheel cover while I'm at it.  When I could barely get the damn cover to stretch over my steering wheel, having to pry my finger from between the cover and the wheel, I should have known I was already beaten.  What the HELL was I thinking?  I ended up forgoing the oil filter when I learned that I would need a special tool.  I tried to figure out where the rectangular air filter went in my engine, but I just couldn't do it.  On my old 70-something Toyota hatchback there was a big round space indicating where to put the filter.  My 98 Nissan isn't quite so revealing.  And for my final act, I put 2 quarts of oil and an oil additive into my engine.  Harmless enough, right?  Well, add that to the oil already in my engine (running very low but still in there) and the 2 quarts I added last weekend, and - ladies and gentlemen - we have a recipe for DISASTER!  I cranked up my car, gripped the squeaky new steering wheel cover between my fingers, and proceeded out of the garage for a Saturday night on the town.  Then, I noticed a black plume of heavy smoke being belched out of my exhaust.  It was so bad that the maintenance guys in my building came running, they thought the building was on fire.  Fortunately, I was able to *have someone else* drain the excess oil out and after a few miles on the highway this morning, the leftover oil througout the entrails of my car burned away and by the time I got to work there was no more billowing smoke from my tailpipe.  So, what have I learned from this adventure (as I always learn something from everything).    1.  I'm just a girl.  No matter how much I believe I can do just about everything, I can't. 2.  I know just enough about cars to get myself into some really big trouble. 3.  The dipstick is there for a reason. 4.  I'm NEVER doing that again. From now on, I will pay for any and all work on my poor little car.    Diva out.           "

So, while it was a bit of an inconvenience, it wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, I had a great weekend.  I participated in Hands on Miami Day and painted the boardwalk a new coat of brown.  Me and 299 other volunteers.  In all, the event attracted 3000 volunteers, with several projects throughout Miami and Miami Beach.  I even saw a few familiar faces, along with my team of 6 other coworkers.   Got a haircut, did a little shopping, and relaxed a little with a Sunday afternoon nap. Pics are going up in the diva gallery of our trick or treat outing.  In all, a pretty good weekend.     Diva out.           "
"        Expanding on the last entry, Food for thought   Eliz commented, 'According to my psychologist... it's a mental health problem that I have. *giggle... It's correctible -- assuming that I truly wish to change.  According to my psychiatrist... the truth lies within myself. She can have her opinion, BUT the truth of the matter depends on how I view it.'  Makes me wonder about psychologists and therapists.  I mean, are we all supposed to be perfectly adjusted and balanced?  Are we all supposed to be free of any preferences or predisposed natures?  If the Drs. all had their way, we'd all be free of addictions, fears, anxieties, attitudes, truths and denials.    But, aren't those the things we bring with us into the world at large, that define us and motivate us?  Aren't those the very things we came into this world to learn from and to teach others about?    Eliz, your psychologist is right about one thing; the truth does lie within you.  Within all of us, as I believe.  And I am still wondering about my own personal koan right now, but not fretting too much over it.  And if I went back to MY therapist, I already know what HER opinion would be!  Because we've been through this one before ;)  Diva out.           "
"        Food for thought  On another note, let me ask you, dear reader, for your opinion.    If something continues to present itself, a recurring habit or theme keeps returning, does that make it karma, destiny, or perhaps just a bad habit?  Example: You're no good at saving money.  You try and try: you open savings accounts, CDs, 401(k), etc etc.  But no matter what, you just don't save.  Or, you diet and exercise, but you just can't keep off the weight.  Or, no matter how hard you try to plan ahead, procrastination conquers all.  See what I mean? Nothing terribly bad, just some little habit that you've tried to break, a pattern in your life that you've tried to change, and it just keeps coming back.  Deja vu, over and over again.  So, I repeat the question: Is is karma, fate, destiny?  Or just a bad habit?  Is it the pattern and design of your life, something that should be aknowledged and accepted, or a flaw of character to be shunned and overcome?  What is your opinion, dear reader?  Of course I have my own curious scenario presenting itself right now, and I would appreciate your input.  So, use that little comment link for all its worth!  Diva out.           "
"       And what bothers me most of all is that my boss never ever gives me ANYTHING for Christmas.  He's a great guy, but he's really very insensitive when it comes to the holiday gift-giving thing.  A hug and a happy holidays, and he's out the door.  That really gets me most of all.         "
"        HoLiDaY uPs AnD dOwNs   Yeah, I'm still in a bit of a funk over the whole holiday thing.  It's very unlike me, which only means that it won't last.  I was reminded in reading last night to 'live in the moment.'  To breathe in, and then out, and to live in the space between each breath.  If you can let go of the exhale, and not anticipate the inhale, then you are living in the moment.  It was a good reminder, and it's helping me today.  That, and the good news of an old friend who is visiting for the holidays.  We're going to do a little holiday shopping in Downtown Miami tomorrow - you know, guerilla-warfare shopping for Christmas Eve.  Everything you need is Downtown.  So, I have the day off tomorrow to take care of the myriad tasks ahead of me, and I will spend a few hours with a very dear friend.  I have something to look forward to, and that makes me happy.  Even without the breathing.    Diva out.         "
"        Let the festivities begin  I went to my Employee Holiday Party last night, and danced my ass off.  Everyone commented, both last night and this morning, on how much I danced.  I love to dance.  In fact, I danced so much that now my kneecaps hurt.   What the hell is that about?   Any way, in case you're interested, you can check out pics  urlLink here .  It was the first party we'd had in two years, and we sure did make up for lost time.  I left at midnight, but as I was leaving the conference services manager had just convinced the DJ to play longer.  I have no idea when that party ended, but when I left it was no where near winding down.  What a great night!    And, that stupid effing bond payment has finally been sent to the disbursement unit to be released to me as payment for outstanding child support.  DBD was picked up the first weekend in August; I may actually get his bail bond just before Christmas.  I think I see shopping in my near future.

"        Something new  I've never had this reaction before, and it has really left me feeling very disturbed and upset.  I was sitting at lunch just now, minding my own business.  Suddenly a santa hat was thrust upon me, and an order to say something holiday-ish into the video cam for the staff party.  I was caught very unawares, and very unprepared.  And, I'm really not feeling it.  I joked, telling them I'll just 'say 'Bah humbug', because I'm just not feeling it.'    My co-worked improvised a very merry holiday greeting into the camera lens, and then all eyes were on me to perform likewise.  I couldn't.  I told them to get me later, because I wasn't ready.  Then I had to get up and leave the cafeteria.  I was too upset to stay.  I knew I wasn't in the mood, but I didn't realize how NOT in the mood I am.  It's a week away, and then it will be all over.  Soon, this will all be over.  Diva out.           "

"        Diva is back  I've actually managed to get caught up on my workload here in the office.  *sssshh, don't tell my boss!* So, I can give you, my dearest reader, a little update on the weekend.  A friend from NY left the artic north for a little frolicking in the balmy Miami sunshine.  I am so glad when we can spend time together, he's the only other person I know who likes to just walk around and check things out. (Besides my brother, that is).  We strolled along Ocean Drive and Washington Ave, Lincoln Road and all across Downtown Miami - in just one afternoon!    Went to see The Last Samurai, and despite the vivid battle scenes - I hate blood, guts and violence - I really loved it.  It was so visually beautiful and so emotionally stirring.  Sometimes, the actors didn't have to say anything, the looks and actions expressed all that was intended.  And, as my friend pointed out, they didn't have Japanese villagers speaking English to each other.  They spoke Japanese, with English subtitles.  After all, why would they speak English to EACH OTHER?  It was well done, and I am really glad I got to see it.    OK, off my movie review soapbox.   As for the Holiday looming in the not-far-enough future, I say 'BAH HUMBUG!'  I have to fix my car's CV Joint and replace a rear tire - my third flat tire in less than 3 months - and I haven't  even started  my shopping.  Then there's all those holiday cards that are being received here at the hotel which just makes for more mail for me to open.  More work for me, delaying me from updating my blog.  And don't even get me started on the whole tree thing.  If I buy a real one *uh-oh.  I've started myself on this* If I buy a real tree, I'll have to haul the thing down to the dumpster in about 10 days, thereby wastefully disposing of a natural resource.  And the money spent on buying a tree could otherwise be spent on presents - assuming I ever get to buy any.  If I buy a fake tree, I'll have to hoard the damn thing in a closet for a year, again using money and taking up valuable space in an already crowded closet.     urlLink I'm thinking bamboo tree again this year.    Although, I am beginning to have the holiday spirit.  I'm hosting a Wine Club 'Holiday Sparkle' event tomorrow night - featuring champagnes ~ ooo la la - and on Thursday I have the hotel's holiday party to attend.   Trust me, no one parties like hotel people, so it should be a really good party.  Then Friday, my little diva will be performing in a holiday show.    Besides that, carols keep playing in my head against my will and my own better judgement.  So, you know, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  *ha ha now that damn song will be playing in YOUR head too!*  Your welcome.  Diva out.         "

"        Voracious  Reader, that is.  Well, that and other things... *wink, wink*  I mentioned to a friend yesterday that I would like to borrow his copy of Hilary Clinton's 'Living History' just as soon as I finish the three books I'm currenlty reading.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  'Three books?  You're reading three books?'  Yeah. I'm reading three books.  Actually, I've only started two of them. As I am almost finished with the one I started on Saturday, I'll probably move further along in my second one, and pick up the third one sometime soon.  I can't help it.  I don't watch TV, I read.  And if you're not new to my blog, you probably understand that I cover a wide genre of literature - but mostly I just read dead people.  Classic literature and philosophy.  So, I'm reading about the paradox of sex and spirituality (which has actually interested me in a few other authors like Henry Miller and Walt Whitman) and I'm reading Jane Eyre, which I bought on my summer road trip but just haven't thought to read yet.  Next is the Accident Buddhist - which I'm figuring will be my life story! - and then I'll borrow Hilary's book.    Oh, but wait.  She's not dead.   Can I read that?  Yeah, for Hilary I can break a rule or two, heh heh.  Diva out.         "
"         urlLink Your Diva turned 34 on Sunday!    I always thought 33 would be an amazing year.  A year of enlightenment.  When I turned 33, I figured, 'Ok.  Jesus and Buddha both discovered their true natures, found themselves if you will, at 33, right?'  (Right?)   And if they can do it, so can I; hopefully without an actual crucifixion or ascension.  No blood or anything, just enlightenment.  A little pain will be okay, but not too much, thank you very much.  And I was right.  What a year it has been.  Joy and pain.  I've discovered much about myself while I was 33, and much of it ended up on this blog.  And I think I'm better for it.  Thanks to all of my blog readers who keep coming back for more *god only knows why you do*.  34, here we come! :)  Diva out.           "

My screw ups and fears are so big because they're all in my head.  Nobody else seems to be carrying around yesterday's drama but me.    So, I'm going to shake it off and move on.

"        Things I ponder   First of all, I discovered a 'hidden racism' yesterday.    I'm catergorized as Caucasian.  My children are considered Hispanic.

Why not Hispanic/Causcasion, or, alphabetically, Caucasian/Hispanic?  It's the 'man' trying to keep my girls down!  Another, completely unrelated, pondering:  ever watch a flock of birds fly in circles together?  They fly to and fro, from one corner of the sky to another, in total unison, and then back to the first space, and around again.  How do they know when to turn, which way to turn?     And, is there ever a poor little screw-up bird that keeps going left when he's supposed to be going right?  Things that make you go, 'Hmmmmm.'

"        In the 'tweens   Any parent who's ever lived through a child being the ages of 10 to 12 know exactly what I'm getting at here.  My oldest little diva is 10.  She will be 11 in March.  She's what marketers call a 'tween' - not a child, not a teen.  And with her coveted marketing demographic come many little quirks.    One of these quirks is that, in public spaces, I am now 'Mom'.  The first time she called me by that moniker, I didn't realize it was my own child calling for her mother.  I'm not 'Mom', I'm 'Mommy'.  So, I didn't bother to look up.  Then, I realized it was her voice calling, so I responded with a small amount of discord.  It just didn't feel right.    Now I've grown more accustomed to this grown-up public version of my daughter.  To me, it indicates a small amount of embarassment to her to cling to childhood things.  Things like good-bye kisses, hello hugs and needing her 'Mommy'.  But last night as I walked her, half-asleep, from my bed to hers, she mumbled a sweet, 'Good night, Mommy,' and all was right in the world again.  In the safety of her own home, without the danger of 'tween' on-lookers, I am still 'Mommy'.  Diva out.            "
"        Right under my nose  You know how you can spend days, or even weeks, looking for something?  Then, you find it right in front of you?  I had one of those experiences.  I have been looking all over the place - online searching, magazine listings, related websites - trying to find somewhere to learn meditation ~ Tibetan Buddhist Meditation (this is where anyone who knows me for any length of time starts to freak out).  I searched high and low for a place to meditate, to learn how to really do it right.  I've been looking now for more than 2 weeks, and everywhere I turned, there was either a disconnected phone number or a dead e-mail address.  Apparently, Buddhists don't cling to communication ;)  I knew that the pastor at my church offered a meditation session on Monday nights, and I finally had a chance to check that out this Monday.  No school, no kids to pick up after work.  So, I went.  To my methodist church with my female pastor leading the sesshin, I had my very first guided Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness mediation.  It was all I had been looking for - and it was right there in front of me every Sunday on the church program.  Under my nose, literally.  Funny how things work out.  Diva out.         "
"        munday  although not quite such a monday, since today is a holiday.  MLK day may not be everyone's holiday, but it does quiet the phones and ease up on the e-mail.  i was able to get a lot done, so in addition to all he's already done, 'thanks, Dr. King!'  had a faaaabulous south beach weekend.  this was the annual art deco weekend - an art festival featuring lots of art deco period art, furniture, posters, jewelry and other miscellaneous things.  and, for the first time in a long time, street performers were legally able to entertain the throngs.  i must admit it did add to the flavor of the event.  i even saw the 'naked cowboy' - i think it was THE naked cowboy, from NY.  Sure looked like the pictures i've seen.  i'm thinking the single digit weather up there may have chased him down here.  its gotta be tough picking a guitar in your skivvies with a negative degree wind chill!  also saw the movie cheaper by the dozen - very cute.  no matter how many kids you have, they will love it, and so will you.    also checked out the new  urlLink Miami Childrens Museum .  not a bad way to spend a stormy sunday afternoon.  kept the kids entertained for a good 3 hours, and we could have stayed longer if the grown ups in the group didn't have other things to do.  in all, it was a very good two days.  quality time with the diva-ettes was much needed.  hope my reader had a great two days too!  diva out.

She can be an individual mother, but as a major arcana card, she also goes beyond the specifics of mothering to its essence - the creation of life and its sustenance through loving care and attention. The Empress can also represent lavish abundance of all kinds. She offers a cornucopia of delights, especially those of the senses - food, pleasure and beauty. She can suggest material reward, but only with the understanding that riches go with a generous and open spirit. The Empress asks you to embrace the principle of life and enjoy its bountiful goodness.

"        Rizzn's fault  I checked  urlLink rizzn's page , and his protest on another blog's comments on the whole gay marriage thing got me thinking (damn him).  I heard a comment on NPR last night, where Bush said something about history proving that marriage between a man and woman is best (or something like that).  I tried to find the quote online today, to be all professional and correct and stuff, but I figured I'd just forge on ahead without it.  Everytime I hear that man speak, I think to myself, 'What the hell is he thinking?'  On the surface, he seems to share the same ideas, thoughts and beliefs of the common 'good american'.  You know, the right wing, republican, christian upbringing, tons on money in the bank common american.  Unfortunately, I don't think he goes any deeper than the surface.  I also don't think he goes any further than the imaginary borders of this country.    I wonder what impact these 4 years will have on the next 20, the next 50, the next 200.  In my great grandchildren's history books, will he be a Truman, or a Nixon?  Will there be another 4 years of him?  Does he ever wonder this too?  His actions and thoughts impact everyone, presently and years into the future.  With any luck, the issues brought forward in his presidency - family, health, money, religion, war - will inspire future leaders to move ahead with less personal agendas.  It is good to talk about what he has brought into the limelight.  It is good to debate over what works and doesn't work.    The critical thinking being done now about so many issues will, in the end, have some impact on how we think, act, plan, marry, spend, work, live.    Then I wonder, did the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs do it any better than we are right now?  Diva out.         "

"        Diva in training  In true diva spirit, I took my oldest little diva to her very first Opera on Friday night.   It was 'Romeo et Juliette', performed in French by the  urlLink Florida Grand Opera .    This was an early birthday present for her, as she turns 11 next month.  I was a little concerned that, being only 10, she may get a little bored.   After all, this is a long one, at 3 hours and 15 minutes - with 2 intermissions.  She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out.           "

"        About my yoga  Some weeks back, someone visited my site and requested that I blog about my yoga practice.  Not sure why, and when I said I would blog about my practice, I never really was sure that I would.    But, lately my practice has increased and, combined with my meditation practice, I am beginning to see some changes in how I do what I do ~ at least in yoga anyway.  I've started getting up earlier, like around 6:30 (without an alarm clock - does this mean I'm getting older?); I'm up with the sun for some strange reason.  Sometimes I just roll over and snooze for another hour, but more often I am getting up and rolling out my yoga mat.  The mornings are harder for me than the evenings.  I'm stiff and sore and weak and hungry.  But by the third or fourth sun salutation, I'm better.  I only get through the standing half of the asthanga practice - normally about 20 or 30 minutes worth.  Then I'm primed and ready for the day, with a bit more energy and optimism than expected.  Evenings are better for me.  I can really get deep into the practice when the girls are asleep.  I can hear my breathing and feel the muscles stretching, feel the vibrations that come when I'm in certain positions.  And, now with meditation added to the practice, I realize even more that yoga is a moving meditation.  Sitting with my eyes closed or staring out into space, my body remembers what movement is like.  Moving through an asana, my mind remembers what spaciousness is.    It is strange, and maybe I'm the only one who will ever understand this entry.  But, I was asked to write about it, and its part of my experience.  And, let's face it ~ this  is   my  blog.  Diva out.         "
"        Keepin' it real  V-Day seems to not be a total disappointment.  Since I am in the office today working on resaurant menus, I got invited to the Valentines Dinner by the F&B Director.  A friend and I will be dining for free on lobster tail and tenderloin.  Not bad, even if my date will be just a female friend of mine.  And, they say good friends help to keep you real.  At least, somebody said it, because I know I've heard it before.  Last night I got together with a few friends from high school; some I hadn't seen in years, some I see (or at least read) pretty regularly.  I think I must have changed quite a lot in the past  *&^%$ years.  We were reminisicing over high school antics, what they did and how I would stand over their shoulder telling them why they shouldn't.    I was their 'Jiminy Cricket', their conscience.    And, I never wanted to drive on the interstate in my little white hyundai.  I'm wondering, was I annoying?  Was I so meek and mild mannered that I was afraid to have fun?  And, more importantly, WHY DON'T I REMEMBER BEING LIKE THAT?   I don't remember playing the conscience to all of my friends.  I don't remember doing half of what they say I did.  I did get into the same mischief my friends did, 'guilty by association' as someone put it last night.  I remember having fun and doing silly things (much of it I really can't discuss here, to protect the innocent).  heh-heh.  I don't know why I don't remember being who they said I was.  They made me sound like, I don't know, a nag, a conscience, a party-pooper... 'you really shouldn't do that, its not very nice.'    But, they let me play with them anyway.  They let me hang out, even when I didn't drink their liquid lunches with them, and I didn't shoot m&m's at passers-by in the hallways, and I  swear  i do not recall EVER throwing citrus at pedestrians, or plucking them from a tree.  Although, maybe I do have a slight recollection of picking fruit late at night...    Anyway, for whatever reasons my friends allowed me to be their friends, I am grateful.  Grateful for teaching me freedom to be myself, and freedom to just cut loose once in awhile.  Last night was a gift for Fred, but I reaped some of those rewards as well.  Diva out.             "
"        Couldn't have said it better myself   'You are more.  Even the most intense experience is only an experience you are having. It is not you, and you are not it.  You are more than your problems, more than your possessions, more than the pains and pleasures. You are more than the frustrations that sometimes feel so overwhelming.  Too often, out of fear, you cling tightly to things that don't really matter. Imagine the freedom that can come from letting go and stepping back.  What if your most agonizing worries no longer had the power to worry you? What if your most burdensome difficulties no longer had the power to trouble you?  Step back from them, and it is all possible. It's not a matter of running away, but of putting the world in perspective.  The real person you are, is not defined or limited by the passing circumstances, no matter how intense they may be. Always remember that you are more.'  -- Ralph Marston  Diva out.           "

Warm chafing dishes half-filled with crispy, savory hour-old bacon and grease-filled crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside fat little sausages.

"        2 tragedies in 2 days in Florida  After seeing the news this morning, I realize that I need to sit my girls down and have a serious talk tonight.  Everyone probably knows by now about the missing 11 year old girl in Sarasota.  Luckily, they have the abduction on tape somehow, so they know who did it.   Sadly, the abductor isn't being very cooperative, so the girl is still missing.   Something you may not have heard about is the murder of a 14 year old boy by classmate in a South Florida school.  One 14 year old boy cut the throat of another 14 year old boy in the school bathroom early Tuesday morning.  While the boy has admitted to the crime, the motive has not yet been established.  These are the things parents dread and fear.  Horrific stories of brutality that you wouldn't bare to hear happening to an adult, much less a child.  And we all think we are impervious to such assaults.   That could never happen to my child.  My child is too smart for that to happen to him/her.   * Tell your child to never go near or into a stranger's car.   * Tell your child to scream, yell, blow a whistle, make as much noise as possible.  Even if the stranger threatens to hurt them if they make noise - be as loud as they can. * Even if the stranger has a gun, run away.  Either the person won't bother to shoot, or if they do shoot, and by some luck actually hit you, you're still better off bleeding in public where someone can help you. * Grab onto something bigger than you and don't let go for anything.  If you're holding onto your bike, a big stick, a telephone pole, whatever, you won't fit into the person's car. *Don't try to help an adult who is a stranger.  You can find an adult you know to help the stranger, but don't do it by yourself. * 911 is a free call.  As soon as you get away, dial it.  The cops will find you no matter where you are as long as you stay by that payphone.  And for school, these rules may have to apply to other students unfortunately.  Its hard to know if your child is being bullied at school.  But, you have to talk about it.  It's the only way to really know what's going on there.  They spend anywhere from 5 to 8 hours there every weekday, and you really need to know what's happening to your child.  These are the things I'm going to tell my very smart daughters tonight.   And then I'm going to hug them very very tightly.  Diva out.         "
"        Soapbox   **Diva unassumingly places her soapbox in the middle of blogdom, then quietly steps up onto her little soapbox.  She opens her mouth to speak.**   Here's my two cents on the whole Janet Jackson boob thing.    At any given time on any given day and on any given channel on TV ('cept maybe Disney  *she mumbles with uncertainty *) you can find women being beaten, pushed, pulled, dragged and raped - with all sorts of body parts showing.  Why is it that, when a woman chooses to show off a part of her own on her own, the networks go crazy?   What, you think your 7 year old isn't watching MTV?  Ever caught an hour or two of Sunday afternoon TNT?    And, apparently the US is the only country bothered by the whole thing.  BBC and other world networks never even bothered to cut away from the incident.  It was the Puritan Americans, with all their family values, that shut their viewers eyes to the shame of a woman's body.  A woman's body that wasn't being manipulated and controlled by their programming.   **Diva lets forth a heavy sigh, then respectfully steps down from her soapbox.  Quietly picks up said soapbox wondering what comments this will evoke, and shuffles away, out of view (and hopefully out of range).**   Diva out.            "
"        Tangled Mind  First of all, it was intentional.  I don't buy for one second that the costume malfunctioned.  Janet's a freak, period, end of statement.  Now that that's out of the way...  Realization Number 1: While walking through the sun-drenched streets of South Beach on my lunch break, just barely breaking a sweat in the balmy 68 degrees (are you jealous yet?), I realized that no matter how tough life can be, I always carry a little bit of joy in me.  Realization Number 2: The art to a sexy walk is never looking like you're in a hurry.  You may very well be in a hurry, but your walk should not indicate this.  As long as, with every step, you feel the stride and enjoy the sound of your heel on the pavement, and move into the next long stride, you will be sexy.  Damnit.   Realization Number 3: Weird, misguided thought number 1: While making my way back from my lunch break walk, a man on the street sneezed really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  Echoing through the streets and alleys loud.  Everyone stopped in their tracks to look.  He moved on, and then sneezed again a moment later.  Twisted thought crossed my mind: Is he that loud in bed?  Then my mind meandered to last night, when I heard my neighbors from what must have been a kitchen romp.  Deep throaty moans with an even amount of time between each of them.  At the time, I just wanted to get my little diva into our apartment so I wouldn't have to explain the sounds coming from behind the other door.  But, today my mind wandered back to the sounds.  Such nice sounds.    Maybe they were listening to a Janet Jackson CD after having watched the game.  Diva out.           "
"        More Diva for your Dollar   Despite my fabulous pseudonym and glamorous locale, it may surprise you, dear reader, to learn that Im not actually all that much of a diva.  I mean, I do get to a salon more than some single moms, and I definitely take very good care of myself.  But, in all, Im more of a regular girl a simple girl with simple needs.  In fact, I havent really done much shopping in a very long time. Of course, with the new influx of child support dollars, Ive been able to get out a little more to get the things all three divas in my household require.  Ive gone a little crazy  new towels, shoes for my diva-ettes, even a new set of pjs for the little one.  I know, I know; out of control.  And I have managed to acquire a little slice of heaven in the form of a Victorias Secret credit card.  Man-oh-man could a diva get herself into trouble with this one!  I made a little visit to my local VS store on Saturday.  At first, after not shopping for so long, I was a little ambivalent.  The store was buzzing with young hotties and their bashful boyfriends, as well as a few almost middle-aged mothers, dragging their children along behind them.  And there was me.    Did you know that they have a lady in the dressing room to measure you????  Did you know that all the salespeople walk around with headsets, chatting back and forth to each other: Hi sweetie, can you get me a 34D, black?  Are you free to assist?    What is with that?  How urgent can it be?  I almost felt guilty for NOT letting someone help me pick out just the right bra.  Sheesh.  But it was quite an experience, and a very nice one at that.  And, I am now the proud diva owner of 2!, yes 2! New VS bras.  I have cleavage  who knew.  Now more diva than ever.  Diva out.          "
"        I (heart) Yoga   I was able to go to a yoga class last night for the first time in more than a year.  Ive been practicing at home, but, well you know.  I get in 30 or 40 minutes of practice, and then call it a night.  And, as hard as I may try to correct my posture and get deeper into a pose its just me.    Like trying to learn how to drive a car by reading an owners manual.  Without the practice and a good teacher, you can only get so far.  Last night, I had the teacher and I had the class around me.  The teacher checked my posture and helped me to get a little deeper into my down dog.  He reminded me to be mindful of my movements, my thoughts and my breathing.  Seeing the other class members working so hard inspired me to get through the class, to do that last Sun Salutation B (I usually only do 1 or 2).  Seeing the others work past their own abilities, stretching themselves into unfamiliar postures, encouraged me to go even deeper into the ones I know so well.  And I did a few arm balances that Ive never done before.  Eventually, after headstand, the teacher had to encourage me to rest, as I had been working like a dog  his words.  My effort was evident, and even I was surprised at having made it to the end of the class without giving up.  Of course, I had a hard time holding on to my steering wheel while driving home.  My body ached all night (and still does) with the effort of getting through that class.  But, in addition to the ache, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and strength.  I feel that Ive opened up some parts of my body that had closed up again after so long without a class.    And I am reminded once again why I love yoga so much; I am constantly amazed at how I keep proving myself wrong  I can do this.  I can make it.  I am stronger than I will ever believe I am.  Yoga pushes me further and proves to me my limitless abilities even as my doubting mind tries to deny it all.    We are all stronger than we know.  Diva out.          "

I love the feeling of the wind on my skin.  Now, if it would just rain.  With all the wind, my car is covered with sand and oceanspray.  I don't wash my car, I just wait for a good rain.

"        Random bits & pieces  First off, I think I may have figured out a way to fit yoga AND meditation into my daily schedule.  I've been working in one or the other for the past few weeks, and my yoga is really suffering.  Last night, I managed to do both before bedtime, and it felt great.  So, I'm putting both on my daily agenda; now if only my little diva-ettes will cooperate by going to bed on time...  I took my now 11 year old diva-ette, along with 5 other 10-11 year old girls, to see Hidalgo on Saturday night.  No, it wasn't penance for my sins, it was a birthday party for my daughter.  It was a lot of fun actually, and I really enjoyed the movie on many levels.  There were some subliminal messages that I got from it, like comparing the 'Arabians' to the American Indians, and the lack of knowledge about the culture creating hatred for that culture.  And, finding yourself, being true to yourself... so many levels to appreciate.  The girls liked the horses. :p  And, they've installed monitoring software on the internet here at work, so that may mean fewer installations.  I know... I know... you're wondering how will you ever live  without your diva.  But, have no fear, dear reader.  I'm working on getting internet at home (which will probably end up being monopolized by the above-mentioned 11 year old).  So, when I should be doing my down-dogs, I may end up blogging instead.  And, one last note; I saw two things downtown on Saturday morning that I've never seen before.  Not counting the new farmer's market, I saw several 'Help Wanted' signs in shop windows, and I saw an overhead construction walkway, encompassing one whole street corner.  To me, these are indicators of growth in the area.  Downtown hasn't seen growth in many many years.  It was just a place to get the occasional bargain, but never considered a serious business/shopping/entertainment area.  With new businesses, growth in current businesses, new construction of housing; Downtown is fast becoming a really great place to live.  Diva out.         "

"        Refreshing point of view  While at lunch today with someone slightly older and, perhaps wiser, than me, the issue of gay marriage flashed across the TV screen again.    He reminded me:  30 years ago, a black man couldn't use the same toilet as a white man.  It was considered 'fundamentally wrong', and segration was 'right'.    Less than 100 years ago, women couldn't vote in this country.  It was unheard of, and well, 'fundamentally wrong'.    Maybe 20 years from now, gay marriage will have moved into the realm of desegregation and suffrage.  Something that just had to be allowed, because how could it possibly be otherwise?

"        Bark!  I can only guess what Fred's going to say about this one... but here goes.  I started taking an herbal extract on Sunday.  Its supposed to help stimulate my metabolism and assist my body in using the fat I've stored around my lower abdomen, hips and thighs.  Its taken from the bark of a tree that grows wild in Cameroon, Africa.  The drops are dark dark dark brown, and I have to put 30 to 40 drops into a glass of water, then drink it.  Someone asked me how it tastes, I told him it takes like I'm licking a tree.  It tastes like bark.  But, since I started taking it, I've noticed an increase in my energy level, a decrease in my apetite and I haven't wanted (or had any) coffee for two days now.   There's that little note on the bottle saying that the FDA hasn't acknowledged the claims for the product.  Funny, though, that there's a warning for some people with certain health conditions to avoid taking the product.  If it doesn't work, why should they have to warn some people about it?  All I know is I want to drop 10 lbs by the time I go to Boston in July and if I can do it with this bark drink, then bottoms up!  Diva out.         "
"        Overdue Update  Well, dear reader, needless to say I don't have internet at home - STILL.  Apparently my PC doesn't have enough RAM *sigh*... story of my life.  Working on it though, so have no fear.  Eventually, I will be able to inundate you relentlessly with unimportant details of my overwhelmingly fabulous life.  I think I must have swallowed a thesaurus with my morning coffee.  Let's see... unimportant details... well, first off I have been reminded of why I don't lay out on the beach, and why I do wear sunblock when I do get out into the brilliant South Florida sunshine.  Think of the brightest, reddest overcooked lobster you have ever seen, and that will give you an idea of what my right thigh and right upper arm look like today.  I carefully covered SOME parts of me with sunblock, heedlessly leaving way too much of me unprotected.  I have little red slivers of sunburn on my butt, since I thought it would be good to sun my buns a little yesterday... not the whole thing, but you know... a little more than is normally covered by my bathing suit.    Sitting, sleeping, walking, breathing... yep, they all pretty much hurt today.  And, as I am pretty sure he doesn't read this, I can tell you all that my online friend from NY has now moved to Sunny South Florida.  That's why I'm sunburnt today; he's busy soaking in the new, more relaxed lifestyle that we enjoy here.  Lounging on the beach on a Sunday afternoon was part of the initiation of local status.  Yummy Argentinian food on Saturday night - grilled chicken and sausage, sauteed spinach and some kind of a flambe'd dessert with caramel-filled crepes was another part of that initiation.  Peruvian and Colombian are also on the list of cuisines to try as he settles in to this multicultural area.  In addition to that, I had the pleasure of catching up with a friend that went away to the Army a little less than 2 years ago.  He came home injured... from playing soccer in California.  I know; it isn't heroic, but hey - it got him out of the service and back home safe & sound.   Had lunch in a riverfront cafe that I've been dying to check out, and it was really very nice.  So, in all, aside from the sunburn, I had a faaaabulous weekend.  Hope you did too.  Diva out.         "

He's compassionate and passionate about where he lives and what he does.  Just about everyone loves him, because he's just that kind of a man.  I was filling in the time while his lunch appointment rushed to get to the hotel to meet with him.  In that 20 minutes or so, we talked about life in Miami Beach, careers, love and lovers, friends and the joy of being who we are.  I can't impart to you what it meant for me to sit quietly at a table. While I munching multi-grain bread slathered with sweet butter, the sun was shining in through the windows, people were moving through the lobby and past the pool, diners were chatting and chewing nearby.  The few minutes we spent talking were more time than I've ever really had to get to know this amazing person.  He loves living his life, he loves his job - Tourism Director for Miami Beach (and so much more), his views on dating, on working a room, on living.  And when you talk, he really listens.  He wants to know all about you in a very sincere way that you feel.    And, now, more than ever, I want to be just like him when I grow up.    Diva out.         "
"        Any excuse for a party  I was up late last night, making Egyptian Lentils for Maundy Thursday.  I'd never even heard of Maundy Thursday until last Sunday.  According to the female pastor at the Methodist Church where I study Buddhist meditation, Maundy Thursday is another name for Holy Thursday, the day Jesus instituted the Eucharist.  This is where we all sort of recreate the Last Supper by sharing a meal together.    Each year, this church gets together, preparing Middle Eastern meals like what would have been eaten way back then in the Middle East where Jesus lived and died.  We'll share our food and share stories of what god has done in our lives, or what he means to us; sing, dance, read poetry - whatever.  You know, 'Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow I die.'  I'm looking forward to it.  My Egyptian Lentils came out really good, and I've brewed up some Mint Tea for the occasion.   Yummy!  And, another cause for celebration - today is  urlLink Buddha's  birthday.  Happy Birthday Buddha!  Diva out.         "

"        LOL  There are times when I just don't laugh enough.  You know, days go by and a chuckle or giggle may escape me, but not those really hearty, robust laughs that shake your ribcage and make your face hurt.  I love those kinds of laughs.  Lately, I notice I've just been laughing more.  Laughing till tears are welling up in my eyes, laughing till I'm hoarse.    The other night, I was carrying my littlest diva with her head resting on my shoulder, her nose just brushing my neck.  I giggled; she breathed out her nose onto the softness of my neck.  I giggled louder.  Before we knew it, we were both giggling hysterically - me from being tickled and her from doing the tickling.  That was the release of a floodgate of laughter for me.  Now, I'm laughing quite a lot; at small misunderstandings and funny little anecdotes.  Life is funny, after all.  I'm feeling good, and my joy is flowing out in my laughter.  And, funniest thing of all is, the more I laugh, the better I feel.  Laughter must be so good for the soul.  Diva out.             "

"        Always Learning  My teacher/pastor mentioned last night how she has learned to see the good in everything that happens.  Even the 'bad' things have some kind of 'good' in them.  A blessing or a lesson.  I felt pretty good when she said it, because I already knew that.  Yesterday was a tough lesson for me.  I received a call about my mom, and that she's being treated for her mental illness again.  This happened off and on while I was growing up. Anyone who's had the same experience knows what I'm talking about.  I was either on my own or in charge of my younger siblings while mommy was not around.    I haven't really had to go back to that since being an 'adult', but yesterday, I was thrown back to being 5 years old and all alone.  But, instead of 'burying myself in my work' as my boss does, I decided to investigate my feelings on a deeper level.  Figure out what I was feeling, where I was feeling it, and why.    And I kept reminding myself that no matter how 'bad' a day I felt I may be having, ultimately it was my mother who was truly suffering.    So, I realized that there was some good in that experience and I looked for the lesson in it.  Then I said a little prayer for her, and for me, and today I hope we're both doing a little better.

Next, seems like my good vibes are rubbing off on my oldest little diva.  I've been hauling her back and forth between school and afterschool, so she could stay late for jump rope practice.  That's right, jump rope.  She's a 'jumper', and she's got the quads and calves to prove it.  She's been going to practice with her team at least twice a week, and I've been schlepping over from my office to her school, to the youth center and back to my office after every practice.  Last night, her team competed against several other local elementary schools. It wasn't like what I've seen on ESPN, but it was very cool.  I never realized you could do so much with a jumprope.  Well, anyway, my daughter's team won FIRST PLACE in her category.  Woo-hoo!  I'm so proud.  And, finally, I bought my ticket to Boston today.  So, that's it.

After the driver side window wouldn't go up on Thursday, I decided it really was finally time to get a new car.  I've been putting it off and putting it off, and the window was the last straw.  I'd been doing my 'don't rain' dance for three days, since the window wouldn't go up.  On Sunday, I walked into a dealership that had contacted me on an internet query.  I was going to get something else, but I got such a good deal on this car instead, so I took it.   I think Fred will like it ~ in fact I know he would.

"        Open for Business  I've been practicing Asthanga yoga for more than 5 years now.  Granted, I've been a little lazy lately, and haven't really practiced at home regularly for a few months.  The last time I went to a class I injured myself deep down in my shoulder.   I couldn't move my arm in the morning when getting out of bed, and it ached for weeks.  Then, about 2 weeks ago, just as the shoulder stopped aching, I woke up with a stiff neck and it's still bothering me a little.  All excuses and delays aside, I went to an Open Yoga class last night.  I tried talking myself out of it, noting other 'more important' chores I could do instead.  I even arrived 10 minutes late to the asthanga class I had intended to take, but eventually ended up at the Open Yoga class instead.  Persistence prevailed!  It wasn't the usual asthanga, but I still was sweating while standing still.  I was introduced to a few poses that I have never tried, and found that challenging and fun.  It kind of shook me up a little.    I was reminded of why I love yoga.    This morning I'm a little sore, I'm sure its only a precursor to what tomorrow will be like.  But, still its not as deep an ache as asthanga gives me, or as deep as that injured shoulder asthanga gave me.  I'll still practice asthanga, but I'll probably mix it up a little more often.  Fred won't get this, but it just felt so good to sweat again.  Diva out.           "

"        Gentle Reminder  Last night, while driving home after a yummy dinner at Sweet Tomatoes, I had what I thought was the misfortune of being caught up in traffic behind a v-e-r-y slow driver.  We're talking like 45 MPH when the limit is 55, and everyone does 65.  I was frustrated because I was trapped behind him for a minute or two, but was soon able to move into a faster lane.  Grrrrr....  But then, a few minutes later, the two left (fast) lanes slowed down to move around an accident.  An accident that had obviously occurred within the last 5 or 10 minutes.  There were 3 cars all crankled up together, and one man was lying flat on his back on the roadside, with a few people trying to help him.  Police and ambulance hadn't even made it there yet.  Suddenly, I kind of felt a little ashamed of my recent frenzy and frustration.  It may well be that, thanks to that v-e-r-y slow driver, I avoided being a part of this accident.  I just keep getting reminded that I don't always know the Plan, or what some other person has in mind.  I only know what I know, and I keep being reminded that I don't really know very much.

"        Mindful Meanderings   People move in and out of our lives constantly (especially when you work in a hotel!).  Most people move in and out of your line of vision without ever leaving a mark.  It is those rare, soul-shaking moments when you meet someone new, but somehow familiar, that truly leave marks on the soul.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it really makes you wonder (much like this entire blathering must be doing now).  I met someone like that the other day, new but not new, and I always relish moments like that.    Then, did you ever notice how poetry can make just about  anything  sound appealing?  Romantic and dreamy?  I'm going to a spoken word event tonight to hear a singer that I really like.  It always amazes me how poetry works on your brain, making everything from waterdrops to blood sound oh, so wonderful.   I'm tempted to write something poetic about some really horrible thing, like decomposing flesh or garbage or something, but I'll spare you.  Of course, if you'd like to submit something in comments... you'll only serve to prove my point.  Also, I had a subtle reminder of what it means to let god work through you.  I never really considered what it means, but I had a great lesson yesterday morning.  My littlest diva-ette grabbed a bagel to go for breakfast, but then never ate it.  So, I removed it from the car, still intact and figured I would have it for breakfast myself.  On the way from car to hotel, I came across one of the resident homeless men that linger on the sidewalk on our hotel block.  Sometimes he's there, sometimes not.  I asked if he would like it, and he asked me, 'You don't want it?'.  Kind of a funny reply, I think.  But I assured him that it was his, handed it to him and had some granola I keep stashed in my desk drawer.  My littlest diva was the tool that allowed the universe to get that man his breakfast.  You just never know what comes your way.  And just when will school go year-round?  I have to sign up my oldest diva-ette for summer camp at $750 for 10 weeks.  Not bad, until I find that I don't get a sibling discount, since I'm not a resident where the camp is, and the littlest diva will also cost $750.  $1500 for 10 weeks of fun in the sun.  I'm thinking a labor camp in Siberia may be better, put 'em to work and pay me! *sigh*    Wonder if Martha Stewart has any openings.  Diva out.             "

Yeah, honor our warriors by grilling steaks and watching people blow things up on the big screen.    So, it was pretty good and it struck a few chords in me, considering how much i am thinking about impermanence and emptiness these days.  *meditation is really sinking in*  Of course, there were a few quirks, like the phoney monster-like very digitally enhanced wolves scene, and just what happened to the people on that ship anyway?  nothing was topsy turvy in the kitchen, so they didn't fall out, the ship didn't go under and back up, nobody froze (that you could see)... ah, minor details that you are NOT supposed to think about.

"        Living Vicariously   An email I received from a friend who just returned from attempting to climb to the top of the Grand Tetons in Jackson, Wyoming...   'I just want to say to you that it was  a pleasure and an honor to share this experience with you all.  I am  one lucky bitch.  love, amy  Hi all, Here is the link to the Mac site with photos from Gloria and my attempt  to summit the Grand Teton.   urlLink PhotoAlbum10.html   Angela was our guide and Karen came along to audit.  We hit some rough  weather as we approached the saddle the first day at about 11,400 feet;  first it rained, then grapple, otherwise known as hail, and then snow  with lighting and thunder.  It snowed and blew hard through the evening  accumulating about 4 inches, when we got up at 3 am.   We struggled to  about 1000' from the summit, but both Angela and Karen agreed that it  was taking too long and it was too icy to continue.   (Besides the fact  that both G and I were damn cold.)  It was a wonderful adventure and I learned a lot.  We were the only  group up there that evening and the mountain was beautiful.  When the  sun finally did come out it was truly a glorious sight.  None of the  other groups that followed us up made the summit either, so that  confirmed our decision.  The camaraderie made the experience and the serenity and majesty of the mountain will draw me back.  xoxo,  Amy'   I have to admit I have absolutely no desire to climb a mountain, but its kind of nice to dream... and to read first-hand from someone who has.

"        Referred to in the Referrer  I've been meaning to comment on this before, and today I think I can put it off no longer.  I always get a kick out of the Referrer spot on my blog, the place that tracks web referrences to this page; in a most unscientific and sporadic way.  I once read a blog page that added symbols to misspell a popular current topic, just to avoid being referred to in search engines.  Now I see why.  I get some of the weirdest mentions on that little referrer!  And, sadly, sometimes that referrer is more entertaining than my blog.  What sparked my comments today was the 'miami beach shitty fireworks' search.  First of all, why would anyone search in that specific way?  What exactly were they looking for?  Second, I didn't mention fireworks on the beach in my blog... did I?   Maybe I did.  Anyway, I think its funny because, obviously, I am not the only one with that opinion of this year's fireworks.  And, perhaps, the searcher was there too.  Sitting on Miami Beach, with me and 49,998 other spectators, waiting and waiting... for a show that started too late and ended too soon.  We are all connected, and sometimes we get to see little hints of this truth.  Diva out.            "
"        Don't You Hate It When...   When it doesn't rain like its supposed to in the summer?  Days are too hot, a/c units break down, and palmetto bugs *ick* come out of everywhere looking for water.  When you're wearing your big granny underwear (for  those  days) and you realize (a little too late) that when you reach down for a file, the granny undie waistline reaches far above your pants waist - BUSTED!  When the one gift you've been waiting for for MONTHS finally gets delivered, but its broken.  When you do nice things for people and they take advantage of it and complain when little things don't go just right.  When your boss takes off in the middle of the day to go to the gym, and you're stuck in the office holding down the fort.  When a good friend is hurting but you don't really know how to make her feel any better about all that she's losing.  When your day makes you just want to shrivel up in a hole somewhere and never be nice to anyone or get close to anyone ever again.  Just one of those kinds of days...  Diva out.             "

"        Gotta have friends  I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention the great time I had with two of my friends over the weekend.  Friends from high school, Gardenpixie, Wyldchyld and myself all met for sushi with our significant others.  We are, and have always been, quite a potpourri of girls.  My boyfriend even asked me how it could be that we were ever friends ~ we are very different from each other in general.  Gardenpixie and her hubby were celebrating their 17th wedding anniversary, they married very young and the marriage just keeps holding.  Wyldchyld brought along her new boyfriend, as she and her got-married-really-young husband have split.  Then there's me with my online boyfriend after a very shortlived marriage.  We have different tastes in music, food and fun.   We may not have much in common, but somehow there is a common thread that binds us.  Years and miles have been unable to undo the ties.  And, when I'm with my friends, I feel 16 again.  And, just as we did years ago, I never laughed so hard as when I'm with my friends.  I'm fortunate to have a great collection of eclectic friends from all walks of life.   It probably confuses the hell out of my boyfriend, trying to figure out  why  I call these people friends, but honestly, there is no rhyme or reason to my friendship.  It's pretty much out there for anyone who'll claim it.  Diva out.          "

"       Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow! - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :(  Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.  While I'm slaving away in work, she can lie by the pool and fight with the cicadas :)  Got my HDTV Cable hookup - unfortunately the on-demand function seems to have broken in the meantime, so I have to get out early again today so someone can come look at it.  On the brighter side of things techie I managed to blag two 1U dual PIII 866 machines for free, I'll swap the mobo's out into a more reasonable case and hook them up at home - no idea what I'll use them for yet but I'm betting that they'll munch a few SETI units in the meantime while I figure it out.....  One last thing - where the hell is the Alt Gr button on US keyboards? - it annoys me to have to type Alt+0128 for the Euro (€) symbol and then have to remember what the code is for accented e etc.  I know I could change the keymap to UK or whatever but I shouldn't have too - how about an Alt Gr option or something?  *end of rant*         "
"       That's right, this is the week, Jen arrives on Thursday and will be staying right through to the following Sunday - Yay! :)  Also on the good news front, I now have Cable TV, Broadband and a new mattress.  On the not-so-good-news-for-Jenny front I still don't have a bed frame, a couch, or even something besides the floor for her to sit on......  On the other hand that does mean that she will have plenty of reasons to do that favourite female pastime - shopping! And with someone else's money no less - always the best way to do it.  Should be getting a few rack mounted dual PIII's gratis from the job too - will be nice to play with them, maybe set up a beowulf cluster or something else equally difficult to configure :)  After all I'll need something to do with my spare time when Jen leaves :)         "
"       I'll be getting bot a new mattress and cable TV/Cable internet on Saturday.  The prospect of Digital Cable with HDTV and a 3MB cable connection makes me drool :)  Should be cool - though I still need some furniture - a desk, a couch, a coffee table etc.  The place looks so bare without anything - though the stacks of DVD's books and cd's help a bit - so shelves are on the list of things to buy too.....  At least the TV works as a monitor so I'll be able to actually able to use my cable connection when I get it.  Hopefully the next post will be from my G4 cube hanging of a 3MB cable connection :)         "
"       My stuff from Ireland arrived this morning - so I now have all my CD's, DVD's, clothes etc.  Unfortunately I have nowhere to put them :(  On the bright side though, I  did  get my new  urlLink TV .  Not a bad price either.  Plan is to use that for now and them wall mount it in the bedroom when I get my bigscreen TV later.  I've been looking at some of the 50' to 60' DLP screens but I can't decide at the moment.    My phone should be hooked up tomorrow which just leaves the Cable to go, fingers crossed I'll be up and running by Monday - it's always nice to have a 3 MB internet connection :)  Got a nice aerobed to sleep on for now, my mattress has been ordered and should be here on Saturday.  No word on my bed frame yet though - can't win them all I suppose.           "
"       I've decided to document my little adventure in America.  My previous attempt at a blog ( urlLink http://adam.killingmachines.org ) has fallen by the wayside somewhat, but I think with some of Blogger's extra features, I should be able to rectify that situation. Besides all that - it will give me somewhere to moan about the red tape infested wold you end up in when you immigrate into the US these days.  Anyways, on with the blogging - after nearly 6 weeks in the country I finally have a new place to live - right next to Reston town center. The rent is reasonable and the big bonus is that I'm within walking distance of the job, which is good given how hard it is to get a drivers license in the state of Virginia when you were born outside the US.  Go take a look at the  urlLink requirements (pdf)  for yourself and try to figure out how many of those documents you might have. It turns out that the only thing I can use to prove my identity besides my passport is the I-797 form I got when applying for my Visa. Not too bad you might think, but then I applied for the Visa in January, so my memory of forms I obtained is a little hazy. It was only when I got desparate and started Googling every form listed on the sheet to see if I could get one that I found out I had the I-797 already. Once I get the learner's permit it's just 30 days until I can take the test - that should be just in time for delivery of the new car :)  Other than that things have been going pretty well. I'm finally going to learn PERL tomorrow - properly this time too - not my usual half assed attempt - the company are paying for an intensive 3 day advanced course - it would be nice to know at least one programming language properly.  Most importantly, my lovely (and far too good for me) girlfriend is visiting in a couple of weeks - all I have to do now is make sure there are things like a bed, chairs, tables in the new place before she comes. Another trip to IKEA is needed methinks.....  That's enough for now - more when I get bored :)         "
"       Not so much from the what happened point of view as from the 'thank God it's over' point of view.  For some reason I was shattered this week - I essentially passed out around 9 p.m. on Wednesday night and slept right through.  Then my bloody ankle started to act up- just when I thought it was getting better.....  On the plus side I found the excellent  urlLink Dia  program which should do as a nice replacement for Visio - who needs licensed software anyway?  The IC department in work finally delivered the Linux box I ordered.  They'd imaged it with Redhat 9, but I didn't like the way they had the disks partitioned and I like to stay a bit more current, so following a plesant experience with  urlLink Fedora Core 2  on my laptop, I installed that instead.  The box itself is a decent spec considering they gave me whatever they had spare - it's a 2.4 Ghz P4 Dell- not bad at all.  Now I'm going to watercool my shuttle system so it stops making so much noise.  Annoyingly it looks like I might have to replacethe RAM in that system - seems to have developed somenasty errors - every time I try to view a Windows Media player video on it the program crashes - and games work for about 5 seconds.  Strangely  enough Quicktime seems to play fine so maybe it's a directx memory addressing issue or summat.           "
"       Well, now that things are settling down a bit I find I have a bit of spare time on my hands.  I have plenty of things on my to-do list but I've got some stuff done.  First off I have kicked off the transition of  urlLink Comerford.cc  to  urlLink PHP Nuke .  I won't be using Dreamweaver to administer the site anymore, because I no longer have a license for it with the change of job, hence the transition to a more web based management of the site.  You can view the initial template here:  urlLink Nuke Site .  In fact now that I have switched jobs a lot of my licenses are hosed - Photoshop is gone too, not to mention Windows XP Pro (I do have an XP Home license, but why bother.....).  There was a time when I would have just kept on using them illegally but that's over.  Usually I can find an alternative that's free and usually Open Source, so that's what I intend to do - just for kicks, here'sthe list and the alternative:    Windows XP --> Linux (currently Fedora Core 2 but that may change)  Dreamweaver --> PHPNuke & BlueFish/Quanta  Photoshop --> The GIMP  Firefox --> Same, just on Linux :)  Thunderbird --> Same, just on Linux :)    Fedora Core 2 is currently running happily on my little Sony R505DL laptop, and all of the bits and pieces, besides the scroll wheel (which I never used anyway) is working.  I'vealso managed to get an RSS feed to work on PHP Nuke by converting the Atom feed.  I put a little guide up on how I did it here:  urlLink Atom to RSS .  So, left on the to-do list:   Install Linux on the Xbox  Build out my two other dual CPU boxes and get them up and running Linux  Design a new theme (or use an existing one) for the Nuke Site    And there's probably more I'll dream up along the way.  That's it for now......         "
"       Woohoo! - I got my learners permit!  This time I got every question right, though if I'd had this test last time I would have had no trouble then either - just the luck of the draw I guess.....  Now all I have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month :)  Yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact - as well as the successful test, the Pistons destroyed the Lakers.  Since I had 20 euro on the Pistons at 8-1 odds I was pretty happy :)  A fact that I am now paying for since my happiness inspired me to drink 7 or 8 beers, oh well.  So, no going out for me tonight - have an 8 o'clock start in work tomorrow and I need some sleeeeep.         "
"       Just realised I never mentioned the new chair - My Lazboy arrived on Saturday and I'm glad tosay it rocks :)  On the bad side of things - I managed to fail the theory test on the Virginia drivers license exam so I have to re-take it tomorrow........grrrr  What's annoying is that I needed 20 correct out of 25 and I got 19 - the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk - 5 times, 7 times, 10 times or 12 times.  How the hell am I supposed to know that - so I went for 12 times and got it wrong - pain in the ass. At least I can get another lift down to the DMV early next week.  Guess I better get studying :)         "
"       Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well, I even have wireless networking going on it, using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :)  Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.  The second one will be donated at cost to Mr. Irwin who has been good enough to drive me around the whole time and populate my apartment :)  The other will be my default file/web/whatever server on my home network.  Since it has RAID capabilities I should be able to come up with a nice fast machine :)  Haven't decided what to run on it yet - BSD or Linux......Fedora doesn't seem too bad so far, gentoo is a possibility if I'm bothered putting the time in, then BSD is as stable and secure as it gets, hmmmmmmm...  Anyways - back to watching the basketball, after seeing England go down to France tonight, a Pistons win would be the icing on the cake :)         "
"       Yesterday wasn't bad - in order to keep myself busy I cleaned the place up a bit - moved a book case to where it is going to live permanently, relocated all of my computers to the new desk, fitted a mod-chip to the X-Box and fitted a half length PCI graphics card to my Qube - whew!  At least now I can use the nice shiny new  urlLink LCD  that I got from  urlLink Iiyama  rather than the television.  Next thing to do is get Linux, probably  urlLink gentoox , working on the Xbox.  Not because I need another box, but because I hate it when companies like M$ try to dictate what you can and can't do with something you bought..........  On the bad news side, my lazboy chair which was going to be delivered today will have to wait til Saturday - they picked the one time to deliver it that I absolutely could not make it home - so much for a 4 hour delivery 'window'.  Roll on Saturday :) At least my bed will be complete by this evening, I'm working from home (at the new desk) so I can accept delivery of the base.  Sin é for now......         "
"       Jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the Old Country - at least then I had all the excitement of going to a new job, a new country, a new apartment etc.  Even the fact that my Lazboy recliner is coming tomorrow can't cheer me up.  It's DMV time once again this week too which does nothing for my mood - though hopefully they'll at least accept my application.  Last thing I want is to have a nice shiny new car and not be able to drive it........  Anyways, I can't wait for September when she'll be back, then all I have to do is help her find a job here and she can stay!   Here's hoping.....         "
"       My apartment now looks like someone actually lives there, my DVD's, CD's and books are up off the floor, though not arranged in any meaningful order yet ;)  As soon as the desk arrives (should be tomorrow) I'll post some decent pictures of the whole thing.  The only disaster was the CD storage unit I got from IKEA - I put it together, after having a few drinks at 1 a.m. and managed to essentially put all the shelves int he wrong way so that the screws are visible - uh oh.  Anyway, once full of CD's you can't see the screws, so not too much of a disaster :)  The sofa/couch is ordered too, now all I need is a lazy boy and I'm sorted - should be going to the lazboy store tonight/tomorrow night to take a look at the options there.  Of course none of this would be possible without the arrival of my lovely girlfriend who can drive while she is here.  She's also pretty nifty with a screw driver and allen key :)  Right now I believe she is amusing herself in Leesburg Outlet mall while I 'slave' away in work.  Speaking of slaving, I better get back to it.....         "
"       Unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up.  Urban-ISP.net no longer resolves, they don't return e-mails and their phones are disconnected.  Looks like that is that.  Because I recently lost my back up of the site I have lost most of the content too :(    A few exceptions are my blog (obviously) and a couple of pages I found in the Google cache.  Ah well, I suppose the site needed to be revamped anyway - still, it is incredibly annoying.....           "
"       OK, I knew that the whole Atkins diet low carb thing was big in the US but I was still surprised when I got here at how pervasive the whole thing is.  I'm prepared to live with it because, lets face it, most of us could stand to shed a few punds - me  definitely  included :)  But just now I saw an ad on the TV - it was for a low carb  DOG FOOD  from Pedigree!!!  That is taking things too far - I mean, sure I got a great laugh from it, but it is getting ridiculous - if your dog is too fat, the TAKE HIM FOR A WALK MORE OFTEN - DUH!            "
"       Decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so I've put together a little tool that converts IP Addresses, URL's and Host names into Autonomous System numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while it's at it too.  It can be found here:   urlLink AS Number Tool   Of course it can be found on the old  urlLink homepage  too.  It all came about because I couldn't find anything to do this for me - needless to say there's a command line version that I use personally too.  Now most people reading this are probably wondering what the hell an Autonomous System is - well first off I'd like to clarify that I mean an Internet Autonomous System, not a Mathematical one.    To use a poor analogy, think of them as the country codes and area codes used in the telephony world - without them you wouldn't have long distance calling because the exchanges and switches would have no idea where to send your call to.  Well AS numbers are something like that in the internet routing world.  Go to  urlLink Wikipedia  to learn more about  urlLink them .         "
"       Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.  Some soppy bits - to be expected in a blockbuster these days - but the effects were good and the action scenes were well put together.  Special effects weren't as jaw dropping as The Day After Tomorrow that I saw last week - never has a film with such a weak story line been saved so well by special effects in my opinion.  Oh, and I've found out that I'll have a  choice  as to where I can watch the Euro 2004 final.  There's a bar in Arlington - Summers - and, if I'm too hung over, there's always Comcast PPV :)         "
"       The site has been down/slow for the last couple of day - no idea why and I'm too lazy to find out.  Hence the reson for the lack of new entries - I have confirmation that my shiny new Audi A4 is on the way to the dealer and everything is in motion - now all I need is that license.  Unfortunately I have to wait until 15th July until I can do the test since there's a 30 day waiting period before you can take the test.  Still, at least it gives me a little while to learn........  I may need the full license to get the car registered and released to me too, which is probably a good thing - having the car parked outside the apartment and not being able to drive it would drive me nuts.  Hopefully I'll know today or tomorrow exactly how much of a dent this will make in my finances too.  With insurance, the downpayment, the initial loan payment and sales tax - it's adding up pretty quickly.  Fingers crossed the up front total is under $20,000 - anything more than that and I'll have to put off buying anything else for a couple of weeks - like food for example :)  Back to work...........

"       I got a letter yesterday, from Audi Financial saying my credit application had been turned down.  Naturally, this frightened the crap out of me and it was too late to contact anyone by then.  Thankfully it was all a false alarm, the letter was generated by accident and everything is fine with my car again :)  Hopefully I can get my license by next week - I've booked an appointment for a test for next Friday (yes I know it's the 13th) which gives me another week or so to get everything down, which should be plenty.  Now there's a change from Ireland - no 9 month wait to take a test.....          "
"       Picked up the new car yesterday - I still can't drive it without a licensed driver in the car too but that should all be rectified soon enough. Pictures can be found  urlLink here .  On the techy front, I finally managed to get some of my content back up following the Urban-ISP disaster.  The  urlLink How to flash a FireWire/i-Link DVD  page is back - people seemed to find that helpful, so I'm happy I got it back.  Most of the other stuff is hosed however :*(          "

"        I had a good appointment with K this past week.  We had missed a week because she was gone, so I was sort of feeling like there was so much to cover and not knowing where to start.  Ended up with us talking about Panther (not a suprise...) and me for most of the time.  Interesting thing happened...  As we were talking about us, and what I get from the relationship that is positive and what the lessons are to be learned, my necklace that I wear all the time just slipped off.              Came unlatched and just slid off.       I caught it and made the comment that that was odd (and heres why I love K), she then started asking me what the necklace ment to me...           and how important it might be that it came unhooked right then in the point of the conversation we were having which was basically about my frustration with Panther...        I told her the necklace is something I have worn for years in different ways.  I change out the items all the time, but am always wearing something.  and 99% of the reason I wear it is because of Panther...I wear either something he gave me, or something that has pertinent meaning to him and I on it pretty much all the time.        Right now I have 3 things on it   a Faery that he gave me    a Konji charm of Faith that we bought in DC    an amethyst crystal that is just mine...        She then lead me through discussing what it might mean that it fell off...and what we came up with was that while it fell off, and that would to the outside world seem like it was 'broken' in reality I could tell it was not (the clasp was still intact) and because I was aware of the fact it slipped off I was able to catch it and put it back on rather then ignoring it and losing it, or assuming it was broken and throwing it away.        This lead to the idea that with Panther and I, that while from the outside perspective it seems 'broken',  from my innerself I see that it is **really fine** and that as long as I pay attention to that fact and dont ignore things and let them fall and be lost, it can be put 'back on'.        Onward now to the lessons I feel I need to learn within this relationship.  I came up with 2 possibilities, which actually leads to one... Let me see if I can sum them up.  Well the one possibility that I have pretty much thrown out and I'll explain why in a minute, is the idea that I am to learn to not be naive and to learn to walk away... the other lesson (which is the harder of the two possibilities) is that I am to learn patience and trust.  Trust in my innerself more then anything.  To trust the inner voice that tells me to keep holding on, and that it is all worth it, while the outer voice is going 'dont be a smuck, just let go and walk away...it'll hurt less now then if it happens later'...see that is where the conflict comes in to play.        The idea of the lesson being to walk away is really the 'easier' of the two...and it really is just the complex expressing itself...the no trust, fear of getting hurt complex...its not really a lesson now is it.        Now the other one, the trust in me, the listen to my inner self one, that one is the hard lesson and the more difficult because it means going AGAINST all my inner defenses that have built up because of the complex that is trying to fool me into thinking its a lesson to be learned.  Sooooo, basically we came to the conculsion that as frustrating as things are right now for me, I really do want to give Matt and I more time and I dont want to turn my back and protect myself.  I need to learn patience, self relience and trust, while at the same time learning to speak up for myself.       ***I cant pick easy lessons now can I?******      We also discussed how this relationship Panther and I have really in all its oddity has some good sides.  The fact that I am 'alone' so much makes it where I am               1) forced to be dependent on myself, therfore stronger then I would be if I was in a traditional relationship where I could dump things on someone elses shoulders and              2) gives me alot of time to do this work, move forward on this journey I have started.  I have no conflicts of someone tugging me away from my inner work and that is partly why I am able to do so much and move forward so quickly.        Also, my doing this work, and shoring myself up, makes me a stronger person to be there for Panther as he starts his own work and really needs my dependability and not my flakyness...          "

"           The alarm on my cell phone went off at the oh so early hour of 6:15.  I awoke from my NyQuil induced slumber to realize I had to go to work.    What a jip.  The weekend was quite calm.  Since we have white trash tendencies, our house was a wreck.  Let me explain.   We have this huge dining room area (see the pics from the earlier post).  Now, since white trash boys don't like investing in things like tables and chairs, my brother chose to use the dining room as a workshop to build a speaker box.   3 days later, it was filled with lumber, sawdust, tools, and blood.  Oh yeah, he cut his pretty bad.  Then he passed out and bled on the floor.  What a puss.  Anyways, The house is now immaculate for at least a day.  Much like the terror alert scale our dictator uses, I will make one for my house.   We are currently at orange alert, which means a full scale mess is a possibility.  I saw an indy film this weekend called the station agent.  Probably the best movie I have seen this year.  Its a must see.  PS  I get to go see the Pixies in September.  Top that, chief.          "

"       My boss where I waitress told me the most moving story yesterday. Picture this guy, Jay. He's Nigerian, but his mom is American. So his English is very mildly accented, but it's mildly Ebonicsy, and the two seem to overlap most of the time. He wears tasteful jewlery, and shoots the shit with everyone in a comfort-level that suggests ghetto familiarity; but he also keeps a distance more respectful than the more ghetto types. So he talks the talk, but there's something not quite right about his picture.  So I'm in between tables, and I ask him what his last name means, and he says it means 'Let the world rest.' He says his great-great-great etc. grandfather, about 10 generations back, was a warrior, and always the first to volunteer for war, so they would always bless him by saying, 'Let the world rest,' so he wouldn't be in danger. It became like a nickname for him, and then it became his last name. Anyway, this ancestor said that if any of his decendants ever needed anything, they could come and ask him, and he would help, even after he was dead. He was buried with a thick chain wraped around his body, and then he was lowered 69 feet into the ground, and the chain goes all that length, and sticks out of the ground where Mr. Let the world rest lies. Legend has it that if you are his ancestor, and you tug on that chain, he tugs back. 'Does he?' I asked Jay. 'Yes,' he admitted, his voice small. 'When I was a kid, it used to scare me...' Throughout the story, Jay's voice had the tone of one incredulous that he is actually&nbsp;uttering these words. I knew that I was the first person on this side of the rainbow to be hearing this story. It was all pretty unreal.      "
"       Friday Night Alexander and Noam met. I, however, was too drunk to pull off anything graceful, and contented myself if not with a job well done, at least with a job not botched. Before the party, Noam and I went out for dinner with A. and N. Noam and I argued politics, me claiming that Israel and Palestine no longer need political intervention, and he arguing that giving back Gaza is a way of not giving back West Bank. Anthony, insecure at the castration of his ever present authority due to his ignorance of political issues, began to chide us for bickering. I looked at him and harshly told him he wasn't helpful, just as&nbsp;Noam, ever in search of a father figure, implored A. to help us. Dinner ended somewhat strained, Noam annoyed at my political views, me annoyed at his caving to A.'s pressure, and A. worried that I was pissed at him.  'Are you angry at me?' he asked when he and N. took us to our car.  'No. I feel to guilty about my harshness to be angry.'  He said it rang true, and we agreed to meet sometime soon.  On the way back Noam and I decided to argue about politics rarely, and to do so respectfully. For example, it hurts him that I argue that Bush and Kerry are so similar because it entails that I don't think Bush is a jackass. I decided to preface any equalizing remarks with remarks about Bush's incompetence as a human being. Etc.   We went to visit Papa at Lake Bruce and sat on a dock and in a kayak. I had this image of my child sitting next to us spalshing its feet off the edge of the dock into the water, and saying to me, 'Look, Ima, my feets are in the water!'   Tomorrow I'm going to Israel, and must remember to call and see everyone. It will take masterful negotiation not to see Aliza Schreibman who I don't mind hurting like that because she broke my heart a year ago in July, and again this year in June. I'm still smarting. I'll send Naftali over to see her.      "

"       In corsets, like we do, year after year, day after day.  Oh to be alive. Feeling well, feeling in power. I know that indicates I'm thinking wrong about things, but until I can get my mind around the right way to go about picturing myself, at least I'm happy. I saw this movie yesterday called 'the grass is always greener'. Fantastic.  Also: I love it how the Economist and the Wall Street Journal can say the same thing about the economy, I mean recite the same facts, but convince you of opposite states of affairs at the same time. It really goes along with Donald Davidson's thesis about paradigms and evidence.  Melech Rachaman, Rachem Aleinu. Tov Umeitiv Hidaresh Lanu. Shuva Eleinu Bahamon Rachamecha.    "

Tsiona and Dani, thanks for calling last night. (PS. in America, we sleep at night, you know, from around 1-9 AM, ok?) I've finally come around to accept that this, well, IS my life. I'm not waiting for something exciting to happen, and I'm not expecting things to radically change. I'm just living it. I think that may mean I've given something up. What the hell. My parents and grandmother insist on driving me crazy. Very strange. I've decided that I need to give them as much as I can without expecting them to realize and without expecting any thanks (since nothing is enough).  And so it blows, tiddlibum.    "

"       I used to think I'd whore my poetic tapestry to the first taker.  Now I know it's not true. Rather: I now know I'd tax he nude in my bed. No, no, what's the word? Ah,  welcome . I would welcome the nude in my bed, if only it weren't...Thursday.  A poem from 'Hymns for the Drowning' by Nammalvar:  Before I could say,    'He became cowherd        fish         wild boat,' he became a million million.  or, perhaps, a favorite favorite? So which of us is drowning baby?  I had a rare encounter today with a dark and evil thought that rang truly true like a newly acquired familiarity, and now, I am on the rampage.  Furthermore: Alan Keys told the world today that Obama's position on abortion is akin to that of the slave traders--let the people decide, never mind what our moral commitments are. It's an oddly affable argument. I can't seem to stop smiling. If only there were no morality to the other side of things, the argument would actually shtim. As it stands, Keys looks a bit silly. Like the authors of the Talmud--'certainly it is our perogative to decide whose life is worth more, the mother or the baby. After all, we are MEN!'  But, as my Rebbe Miriam says, sarcasm is not an argument. So here's the argument: fuck off. Don't tell me you want to marry me and then leave me a $50 tip when I can't throw it back in  your face because of my credit card debt. Can't you see that the sight of you makes my knees shake, and bile rise in my throat?!? I hate you all.     "

"       Woke up at 7:15 am to finish editing a final presentation for my Revelation to John class, a New Testament course that pairs more typical textual analysis with artistic interpretation.  Changed my view of seminary education and of my own learning.  My presentation compiled some of the thoughts of my journal entries this semester about my study of apocalypic literature and the presence and role of apocalypse as a trope in contemporary American culture.    9:30 - finish editing, make copies of my work for profs and students - the piece is performative and participatory so I am a bit nervous.  Just coffee and a power bar to keep me totally filled with both real nurished energy and my morning drug of choisetype energy.  10:15 - watching the presentations of other students in the class doing their final interpretations of Revelation, like Lois, who designed a beautiful quilt representing different images in the biblical text.  Amazing, the power of visual imagery to infuse meaning into written verse and make it timeless with artifact.  10:50 - I am on.  I go.  It is over.  So much work and then, boom, done.  11:30 - I am in someone else's performance, performing as the Bride of Jerusalem opposite Nicole, who wrote the place based on her reading of the relationship between the Bride and the Whore of Babylon.  When I was studying Political Science at Swarthmore, I never imagined I'd dress up and wear a mask to class for a final presentation.  Shit.  2:00 - presentations over.  It is a fucking gorgeous day.  I feel good but tired.  Sit out in the courtyard sun, a sanctuary in the middle of NYC, anticipating the feeling I will have in a few weeks of no more classwork.   3:00 - in the library with Neil working on my Jewish-Christian relations paper which is 30 pages and counting (only needs to be 15) and somehow has become both a release of many emotions/observations of my experience as a Jew in this Christian environment as well as a place to synthesize my thoughts.  But, god.dammit.  this must stop.  Hence the blog, where maybe I can funnel all that shit instead.  4:00- Neil convinces me to watch Oprah.  He watches Oprah and I read Essence, the magazine for men that is entirely about women and sometimes I interrupt Oprah to read outloud, probably pissing off Neil who actually wanted to watch Cameron Diaz talk dumbly about very little.    5:00 - Back in the library writing.  Isn't this exciting.  6:00 - Neil and I walk starting up at Riverside Church at 122nd down into Riverside park to the peer at 70-something and back up to some great salad joint on 114th and Amsterdam.  It was five mile walk at sunset.  Beautiful river light, fresh(er) air, happy-looking people, not the library, good conversation, expending stress, great salad.    8:30 - in library, baby...  And off I go, onward in my quest to write thoughtfully about the most non-verbally expressable experience I have ever had.  Yee-haw.  -Turtle          "

"           My tennis elbow is a bit bad today. You know, I don't play tennis. I just spend my day here sitting in front of the computer. It hurts like hell actually.  Today doesn't feel like its going to be really hot. The weather was hazy but nice, it was fresh but humid. Who the hell cares?  Well, if you live in a place that can become an inferno in less than 2 hours you would. Temperatures around 38C are expected later this week, that means it will probably feel like 45C in this humidity saturated hell hole. To the imperialists, 45C is way too hot.   But it is a bit unfair to call it a hell hole, it can be a beautiful place, with gorgeous mountain framed sunsets and spectacular cloud effects. I enjoy watching the mountain every time I drive home from work. I can get lost in its deep misty ravines and am myself mystified by its white faces of rock around its tops. I wish I could be a cloud, and roll down its green sides, scratching the unscratchable depths of my soul with the tips of its evergreens.   Too bad...

"           What's with my blogg? Is it too stinky? Why isn't it in the most recently updated whatever list? I wam destined to live unkown by the rest of the world.         "
"           I think I am a moderate fan of  urlLink Cosmic Baby . I could be much more of a fan if I could actually afford to buy any CDs. But hell, he's one of the great when it comes to electronica. It sure feels a bit wrong when teens nowadays believe that there is nothing greater than Moby or whatever electronica they listen to, if they do at all. I also miss Future Sound of London. They made me so happy, and they still do whenever I get to listen to them. I get so bored of having the same CDs. Sometimes I catch a bit of sample from them in the Discovery Channel, that always makes me smile. But it is also sad that we can't continue to enjoy their sounds, but somehow we can still listen to Madonna and U2 even after 20 years. So lame. Perhaps I should build a list of groups that I would have loved to never let go of ever. Maybe someday.         "
"           I am putting to good use the Blog This button on my google bar.    urlLink Hyperreal  is a site that is reminisent of the first sites I was such a fan of back in 1996 when I ' mosaiqued ' my way through the internet. We've come so far now with all this. I used to be cool back then. Very first outlaw web page in my university. Now I am one of the drones. Help! Please Help!          "
"           Ok.. here's something useful:  urlLink turux   I don't know who does this site. I don't know what it means. I just know I love it so much. It is to me the first, finest, and only proof of real electronic art. The feeling to me is indescribable. Although of late I have been wandering off the real techno freaking path, I am still a techie. This site helps me jump from thecno to electronica. It's just sublime. I hope someone reads this and agrees with me.         "
"            urlLink gmail swap: checking for invitations   Ok.. what's this about 'active' bloggering? I think I failed to read the fine print on this page, or is there? I want my account. Do I have to keep blogging to get one? Well, I will blogg you all to death.   Just so you know, I got an account at blogger.com even before I knew it was a 'gateway' to get a gmail accoun.  Not that I will ever get one.  Just my luck.         "
"           Well... cheking this site out :  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  I found out that supposedly if I were an active blogger in this site, I was going to be invited for a gmail account. But to my luck, I wasn't. I then thought that because I was a Mexican and I put that in my profile I wasn't being invited. It's so obnoxiuos when geographical specific content is offerd in sites. My latest outrage was when I wanted to check out the episodes of the not so popular animated series of The Clone Wars that in my country appear on the cartoon network (I'm not bothering to create links for this things, that goes to show you that I am still indignated). Well I connected to the cartoon network site and when I tried to watch the damn cartoos, that I don't even like that much anyway, the browser spewed out somehting like  'This content is not authorized for your region' . How about that? Sucks. Well anyway, I hope that my offer for a free translation of documents in the site will prompt anyone for a gmail swap.   I don't think that's going to happen.         "
"           After reading this subversive piece of journalism  urlLink  'DEMOCRATS FOR GUNS' (Ted Rall)  I began to shiver with rage. What would happen when all you stinking democrats vote for Kerry and put him in office? Yes, I have heard from very trustworthy sources, that as soon as Kerry steps in office (something that we must seek to avoid at all costs), he will completely ban the use, breeding and petting of possums. I mean, what the hell is that? It is since the beginning of this great nation that we have been cultivating the art of breeding and training possums for our own enjoyment and protection. Who will protect my kids from potential, possum wielding strangers? We must fight for this right.           "
"           Hell...  I have never felt comfortable enough with anyone to really tell the first sexual experience I've ever had, so I have a bit of a problem with first times. Some people may even say that I don't give a good first impression, but as they get to know me, in time, they change their minds about me. I find that hard to believe, I think they actually confirm that I am a pompous ass and just realize that I am rather harmless and decide they can actually get by without giving a damn about me.  So without further ado I give you what hopefully will be endless pointless observations on my life and pretty much a complete waste of time.          "
"            urlLink Yahoo! News - BUSH YOUTH?   Regardless of what this article says on Kerry and Bush, I found surprising what it says about the 'real estate bubble fueled by low interest rates [that] has deprived the vast majority of Americans under 30 of even the hope of buying their first home. '  I also want a home, I also want a life, but it's so hard. My job and my position is hard. I can't do what my father did when he was my age.   So sad.         "

"                 Went to watch Spidey today... hmmm... yesterday I mean... haha... F.A.N.T.A.S.T.I.C. Absolutely Fabulous! Rather realistic to a certain extend I would say. Even a super hero has to make tough decisions. Even a super hero can be at a lost of what he wants and what he wants to do. Even a super hero needs to learn to trust and believe in himself. So do all of us! There is a hero in everyone. I truly agree with what Aunt May said. In life, you need to believe in yourself and in the things that you do. Decisions may be tough, but as long as you believe that you can do what you have to, and do it to your best ability, it doesn't really matter what other people think. The life is yours! And yours alone! And most importantly, do not forget your family and loved ones. For they are the ones who will always be there for you when you are down. For without them, life will never be complete! I still believe in this!      "
"                 Almost 5 years together, and all it takes is for a SINGLE bugger to come along... and there goes a relationship... Not me of course... a friend...  5 years together with her now ex-bf, a relationship which all of us deems to be unbreakable, stable and heading towards marriage... and now, 5 years later, 1 single jerk comes along, stuck himself to the lady, and there she goes...  This is just 1 of the many such cases I have seen among my friends. Does time really measure the strength of a relationship? Saddly to say, the answer is 'No'. Is this really how fragile relationships are these days? Perhaps it is. I have just gone through a rough patch in my own... gladly to say, things are alright now...  Absence defintely do not make the heart grow fonder in most cases, at least not for the many cases I have seen in my life. Absence makes the heart grow wilder... that would have been a better description for relationships these days. Oh well... Wilder or fonder... only time can tell... No signs of any wedding bells ringing from any one around me yet... or maybe there is 1... my buddy.... hahahaha... Ding Dong Ding Dong... I hope my time will come! =D       "

"                 Went back to NTU to get some photos taken... for graduation of course... went round the entire campus to have pix taken at all important places... Tiring day. But definitely lots of fun!  Can still remember the 1st time i went to NTU. Ran into a group of graduates running around in their acadamic dress having their pictures taken... and there i was... all envy... and now! Before you know it! I am wearing my academic dress having my pix taken... running around school with excitment~ Weeee~~~ I'm finally out!!! But I am really sure, I will miss these schooling days! All the mugging, and most of all, all my friends, the fun we had and the loads of stuff we ate for all the countless suppers!  Ok... really tired... time to call it a day... zzzzzzzzz  Good luck to all those still mugging out there! Your day will come!!! Just like mine!       "

"                 It has been a really really long week. Have been home late everyday this week. Late nites. Insufficient sleep. Shall try to come home earlier next week and catch more rest. Don't really like the feeling of being zonked out every single day. Went SPLISH SPLASH yesterday. Hmm.. not reallly splish splash... more sun and lazing around the entire afternoon. Relaxing day. Back to another busy day today. Tuition day. Gonna be another long session I guess. Shall try to make it short and sweet. Seriously over spent this week! Unbelievable! Really have to cut it down... Or I'll never reach my target! No matter how many tuitions I do. Oh Man! I need a better job! Or maybe I need a C.A.R.E.E.R.!      "
"                 WeEeeeEEee~~~ Finally! Another work week has ended~ Feeling really really tired this week though haven't really been doing much OT. Guess it must have been the going home late, thus delaying sleeping times... Oh man! Really need to try to sleep by 11pm at least 3 times a week! Otherwise the energy level does dips straight down! This week is almost a spending week. Terrible! Spending too much money. A Mango denim skirt, a zara blouse, skirt from Esprit, lotsa little snacks and chocolates and expensive meals. Need to curb spending next week! I really need to get my tuition money this week! To top up for all I have spent on my shopping and food!  Gonna be heading down to the pool later! Its just gonna be a wonderful day! Nice tan! Swim!      SPLISH SPLASH!          "
"                  CHAPTER 1: Preface  Start of yet another lifeless weekend... boring... No longer so excited about the weekend... used to look forward to every weekend... weekend used to be time to enjoy... relax... shop... or just meeting a couple of friends for chat... and food... But as working life moves on... the weekend becomes just time to see no work... though most of the time there is still the thinking part... And the weekends are most probably going to change after the resolutions and calculations I have made today...   CHAPTER 2: Resolutions  New resolutions... I made today... and to keep.... and achieve... Money I will SAVE! Savings I will BUILD! Snacks I will CUT! Shopping I will REDUCE! Weight I MUST LOSE!   CHAPTER 3: Calculations  Have spent too much money recently... oh man... at the rate I am going... I will never ever reach my targetted savings by the end of the year...   CHAPTER 4: Motivation  Sick and tired of being the fat me... Time to be the me I used to be... Frustrated of being labelled fat... This is really the last straw... I will... and I MUST... be the me I used to be... No matter what it takes... minimum money spent of course!Target Date: IRAS DnD...   CHAPTER 5: Conclusion  There ain't no stopping me this time... No one... Nothing...       "
"                 Singapore Idol was dumb... funny... but i still prefer American Idol... Really thinking if there is a Singapore Idol 2, should I go give it a shot... haha... but the idea of having to queue kills all thoughts... Simply too lazy... guess I am not that desperate yet... but still... it's a chance to stardom for some...  I guess after so many years... i am still me... I still dun have the courage to go for auditions... I still can't forget how I actually went for the hall 7 jam band audition... wouldn't have gone if not for some friends who accompanied me... will always remember the many rounds of audition they put me through... and how i thot i was a goner at the auditions... singing with a sore throat... but the miracle... I got in... the feeling to perform on top of a stage for a crowd is certainly very different... you really need to experience it to understand it. Hope I get a chance to perform again... I really hope... =D It's up there when all my troubles go away... all I can do is try to remember all the words to my song... and concentrate on my singing... no worries... no troubles... free... for that few minutes... free.
