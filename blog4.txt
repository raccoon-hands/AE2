"             OK, now equal time for the Republicans.  George W. Bush should replace Dick Cheney on the GOP ticket with Osama bin Laden. Here is why:  10: bin Laden was born in another country, but that's OK, Bush was born on another planet! 9: Bush needs bin Laden's money. All the multi-billionaires in the U.S. are pulling for Kerry. 8: bin Laden is even better at hiding than Cheney is. Only Bush knows the whereabouts of either one of them. 7: Like Bush, bin Laden does not believe in the separation of religion and government. 6: The Taliban is very good at punishing people with differing opinions. 5: Bush and bin Laden both deny their connections with Saddam Hussein. 4: With Kerry getting all the votes of singles, Catholics, women, and men under 30, Bush needs all the Muslim votes he can get. 3: bin Laden does not have any history of heart trouble, becuase he doesn't have a heart. 2: To get THIS economy out of recession, Bush not only needs God's help, he needs Allah's too.  And the NUMBER ONE REASON???  1: bin Laden saved Bush's ass in 2001, and Bush owes him a favor in return!!!          "
"             Here are the top 10 reasons Scott Peterson would be the perfect VP running mate for Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry:  10: Scott Peterson couldn't be much worse. 9: The fact that he's about to become a convicted felon has never stopped the Democrats before. 8: He lives in California, and the Democrats need its 55 electoral votes to win. 7: Like Howard Dean, he killed unborn babies before beginning his political career. 6: He's younger than Dick Gephardt or Joe Lieberman.  5: No one will say Scott Peterson should be at the top of the ticket. 4: He's one of only two men who can abuse the women in his life and still have the support of the N.O.W. Klux Klan. Bill Clinton is the other. 3: Gephardt voted to ban partial-birth abortion, and Edwards missed the vote altogether. Peterson actually COMMITTED a late-term abortion. 2: It does not matter to a feminist that Laci did not consent to the abovementioned late-term abortion. If she shows signs of being pro-life, just make another Terri Schiavo out of her. 1: Because Hillary Clinton has chosen Scott Peterson, and no Democrat in his right mind would contramand her orders!

"             On July 4, 1776, a new nation was born on this earth, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal.  On July 4, 2004, a new blogspot site was born and is dedicated to the proposition that the abovementioned nation has failed to treat all people equal.  For America to be a land of liberty and justice for all, its government must renounce all favoritism and special preferences, and moreover must renounce its longstanding desire to control the private lives of its citizens through laws and policies, and the enforcement thereof, which infringe upon the constitutional separation of powers. Whether it be favoring the female over the male, the rich over the poor, or the born over the unborn, any attempt to protect one class at the expense of another is an abrogation of the principles upon which this country was founded 228 years ago.

"       I'm alone in the office today, doing the last bit of packing.  Once this is done, I'll have Saturday and Sunday to relax a bit before getting on the plane Monday at 5pm.  I'm really looking forward to some down time, I must say.         "
"       The movers are here today and it's freaking me out.  Two days had been scheduled for this move, but it looks like they are nearly done.  Tomorrow, the Salvation Army is coming to pick up the furniture, etc. that I'm not taking.  Almost done...         "
"       More pictures... My sister Karen and my nephew Blake came to New York for a visit.  It was the week-end after I got back from Copenhagen, so I was pretty jet lagged and had lots of work to do.  Karen and Blake dropped me off at the office after brunch...Blake, who is seven, didn't want to leave...I got him hooked on to Bionicle.  When they left, they went straight to FAO Swartz to buy some Bohrok.   Karen took some great pictures of the view outside the windows of the LEGO Direct office.  Not the same view I'll have in  urlLink Billund ...    urlLink            "
"       The movers are coming on Wednesday, but instead of packing I decided to post the pictures from my last trip to Denmark.  About three weeks ago, there was a Bionicle team meeting in  urlLink Copenhagen  that Jeremy (who works with me on bionicle.com) and I attended.  The day before the meeting, we visited  urlLink Little Device  who is developing a new game for the site, and had dinner with Dan, Anders and Nils.    urlLink     The next night, after the Bionicle meeting, everyone went to dinner.  It ended up being quite a fun night.     urlLink            "
"       Thursday night was the big LEGO going away party at the  urlLink Screening Room .  My co-worker, Danny, is going back to Billund and his last day in NY is next week too, so it was a combined send off.  Of course, I ended up getting pretty mushy (I'm really going to miss seeing my friends in this office), but not quite as mushy as Danny...      urlLink            "
"       As I was starting to pack this week-end, not only did I produce 5 garbage bags full of clothes and shoes to get rid of, I found some old pictures of Jim and I back in the Day.  This picture was taken at a club opening in 1993.  I dont remember which club... its when I was working at New York Magazine and I had a press pass *sigh*              "
"       I was going over the Brooklyn Bridge tonight, and looked back to see the 'tribute of lights'.  Rationally, I understand it.  But the glow at 'ground zero' only makes me think of the days and weeks after the attack.  It makes me remember, so intensely, the shock, fear and sadness I felt when it happened.  I know there are many people who have been much more effected by this than I have, and have lost people they knew and loved.  I can't imagine.  Even without any personal loss, I can't seem to get back to normal.     People seem to be amazed that I can leave New York for a place thats...well... out of the way.   Im fine with moving to a place doesnt have skyscrapers that people want to fly into.  Im fine with a place thats a little less exciting than New York city.           "

"       My first week in Denmark...  I've been staying in Billund this week, at a place called Gravh&#248ven, which is impossible to pronounce and apparently means 'tomb' in English.   I have a bedroom/bath in a 4 room dorm (sharing a living room and kitchen).  Right now, there are only 3 of us living there, a guy from LEGO in Enfield, CT and someone who works for Avis.     This week-end, I went to  urlLink Kolding  to look at an apartment and check out the city.  It's about 40 K from Billund and it has a castle that's about 700 years old.  Ive decided to take the apartment and I may be able to move in next week... my furniture wont show up until the end of April, but I wouldn't be in the 'tomb' anymore...    Saturday night, Sanne took me out in Vejle with lots of other LEGO expats...it was so much fun that I only remembered that I had my camera for one picture...     urlLink             "

"       While playing with iPhoto, I realized that I could export my photos to a QT slideshow movie.  And, I could add one of my MP3s from iTunes.  I love  urlLink Apple .  The only problem is that it's 5.5M, so it may take awhile to download.  Don't do it if you're on dial-up. It's the same pictures that are on the site in the previous entry (there are a few extras).       urlLink            "

"       I was hoping that my last three week trip to the states would be the last of my business travelling for 2002, but no such luck.  At least I got to see lots of friends and family.

There are pictures of my niece, Constance (below) and my nephew, Blake.    There's a also a picture of the flowers that Lars sent me while I was in New York by myself and pictures of us at the Lousianna museum (just outside Copenhagen) the day before his birthday.  When went to dinner at Soren K in the  urlLink Black Diamond library  in Copenhagen (great suggestion, thanks Dan!) and saw a Duran Duran jam.  Fun.

"       Lars and I had the cheeziest New Year's Eve ever in Hurgada, Egypt.  We went to a party in a big tent, with musicans, belly dancers and food that made us ill for days and days. Here are pictures of the entire trip to Eygpt.   urlLink     Despite our sickness, we did get to go to Ciaro for two days and see all kinds of old stuff.  I even went in the Great Pyramid of Giza!  Very exciting.            "
"       As I mentioned in an earlier blog, my birthday present from Lars was a trip to Prague on Valentine's Day week-end.  Prague is a great city, but it was so amazingly COLD.  We did some site seeing, but we were freezing our butts off, hence the pained look in many of the photos.     urlLink             "
"       Lars and I just returned from a week of meetings in Toyko and Seoul.  We got the rare opportunity to look around a little in both places, and it worked out that we had an extra day in Korea for sightseeing.  In addition to visiting a shooting range, we took a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border of North and South Korea.  It was rather eye opening, since my only real reference to the Korean war is M*A*S*H... it was also a bit surreal and certainly put a new spin on the current situation in North Korea for me...     urlLink    The Bridge of Freedom in Korea         "
"       I finally made it to Madrid to see Jim and Emmanuelle, just in the nick of time.  In addition to being shown around the city and a side trip to beautiful Toledo, I got to see both Jim and Emmanuelle's studios and I am now a proud owner of a Jim Kendall painting (a long-time dream come true).  Unfortunately, Lars couldn't come with me (he had to work), the only thing missing while having a wonderful time with good friends.   urlLink            "
"       A few weeks ago, Lars and I were showed around London by the Gillespies (Colin, Ginger and Caty Mac).  It was a great time!  Here's some pix.    urlLink            "
"       Lars and I (mostly Lars, since it was my first) had a traditional Danish Easter lunch for a few friends on April 18th, and we took a couple of pictures... there are also many of pictures of the house we are buying!  These were taken before the deal was finalized, which is going on now.  As you can see by the pictures, it's a fixer upper and we have a lot work a head of us.    urlLink            "
"       With just 13 days before we move into the house, it's a bit frantic.  Lars has been working very hard on the kitchen, and it shows.  By the end of the week, we'll have the granite counter installed, new windows and a nearly completed kitchen.   It doesn't look likely that the bathroom will be anywhere near done, but we both have two weeks holiday from work after we move so we'll have time to get everything in order before resuming our normal lives... but once we get the inside done (or done enough for the time being), we'll move on to the outside and the garden.    Lots of new pictures, take a look!   urlLink            "
"       When I got home after being away for work for two weeks, so much progress had been made on the house!  It's really starting to come together.  All the hardwood floors had been sanded, and Lars had been busy putting up molding in the bedrooms and gutting the kitchen.  The kitchen and the bathroom are the big rennovation jobs we still have to complete before we move in (in mid July, so not much time left!).  Lars is doing most of the work on the kitchen himself, right now, in fact.  I need to get over there to help out and continue removing tile from the bathroom walls, oof.   I also took some pictures of the utility room and the garage, which I haven't shown here before.   These new pictures just give some different views of the house.  More to come before the week-end is out.    urlLink             "
"       We are now officially home owners!  We had the keys to the house before everything was final and started working... We started by cleaning everything and painting the bedrooms.  In the main bedroom, we ripped out the closet and Lars has since built a new one and ordered new sliding doors.  Both of us will have a room for an office. We spent one beautiful Sunday afternoon mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges, but the garden and lawn are definitely phase 2.   This group of pictures are about a month old now, and since then we've painted the living room and all of the wood floors have been resanded.  Apparently there is no kitchen right now, Lars has ripped it all out in preparation for our NEW kitchen (I'm currently traveling for business, so I got out of having to remove wallpaper--yay)... and we get new windows in a few weeks.  More work in progress pictures will be posted soon.    urlLink            "

"       The past few months have been incredibly busy and I've been neglecting my blog terribly.  I do have some updates, including pictures of the bathroom as it's being remodelled.    In July, Lars and I went to the Grn concert ( urlLink where Suede performed ) and I took some pictures.   urlLink     I also have pictures of the bathroom from a few weeks ago.  We've enlarged the bathroom, taking some space from the utility room.  It's been quite a process, but we're getting close to having a nice bathroom.  Yay!  Here's a picture of our old bathtub on the lawn, where it lived for a week or so.     urlLink              "

"       The past few weeks have been cold, rainy, difficult and emotional.   Work has been... more frustrating than usual (as per my previous post).  But today is a bank holiday in Denmark, which makes for a much needed long week-end.  The holiday is Whitsun, which is another name for Pentecost, and is held on the seventh Sunday after Easter.  It's a holiday in a number of European countries.  And the weather has been glorious!  Last Sunday I ran a 5K race (Lars ran the 10K version of the same race), which has gotten me inspired really start running again.  I have a 5K route through the forest near our house and with this wonderful weather it's been a great revitilizing experience.  I walked the route yesterday and took some pictures.   urlLink     It's good to remember there's more to life than LEGO...          "
"       Lars and I hosted a party for the BIONICLE team in April.  It was while shooting the extra footage for the DVD, so everyone was around.  This was just before everything started going to hell, but just after I found out that it would.  The changes that have been made on the team were the worst possible changes... definitely for me personally, but I also think for BIONICLE in general.    Well, it was an amazing thing to be a part of for the past four years.  I believe that time has come to run, not walk, to my next adventure.  Very sad.   urlLink     The producer of the extra DVD content, Pam, has a very cool blog herself  urlLink foo.fa.raw.net          "
"       We had another Easter lunch this year... it looks like it's becoming a tradition (a few pics from last year are in the  urlLink May 2003  archive).

"       Lars and I spent last week-end in Hamburg for our 2 year anniversary.  I was a little surprised by how sophisticated it seemed--I guess I expected a smaller town feel.

I'm determined to make this week's come true.  I'm overdue for some excessive laughing...  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21):  urlLink Laughter Yoga  is a new international phenomenon that began in India. Practitioners gather together regularly to engage in half-hour sessions of nonstop chuckling, chortling, and cackling. Yogic breathing exercises supplement the therapeutic value. The month of June will be an ideal time for you Sagittarians to launch local branches of these Laughter Clubs. The astrological omens say you'll be running into an extraordinary number of funny things. That's lucky for you, because you have a lot of accumulated tension to purge, and the best way to do that is by having hilarious experiences.         "

Kay, heres the run down:  Carlene has been looking for an internship in the field of Graphic Design so that she can gain some early on experience before entering fully into her career.  So she had contacted a few places and this one place, I believe they're called 'Creative Imagination'; had called her in for an interview. They we're looking to hire someone for a 'paid' internship ...That's right paid baby! So this was the perfect opportunity for Carlene to get the experience under her belt AND get paid for it. She was a little nervous and wasn't sure if she'd get it but....  SHE GOT IT!!! UN HUH! *does a funky victory dance*  Yep she just called me and I almost went into tears, thats how happy I am for her... that and she can help pay rent now hehehehe jk! No really I am so proud of her, she truly is an awesome designer.. she thinks I tell her that just cuzz I'm her bf but it's true. I don't know anyone else who takes time to really think outside the box. I mean her design and concepts go far beyond her instructors expectations and being that I am in the same industry I can honestly say that we need more designers like her.  CONGRATULATIONS BABY! I'm sooo proud of you! Let's celebrate tonight, dinner and a movie on me k? Love ya!         "
"           T-minus 4 hours 3 mins 12 sec till gym time. I woke up 5am this morning too groggy to do anything so I X'd the gym routine this morning and instead I'm gonna meet Carlene at L.A. Fitness @ 6pm to try and catch a Spin class and then do some weight training. K back to work...         "
"            urlLink    'WHATCHU MEAN SHE'S SCARED!?!?'&nbsp;  This picture was taken when Carlene and I decided to have ourselves a lil' picnic. Yep we had the picnic basket, blanket and everything. We went to this park her mom used to take her and her sister when they were young.  It was nice to kick back, relax and watch our Penelope (our dog) frolic around in her american flag dress Carlene's mom got her from the Philippines. I know she's spoiled but can you really say no to that face? I mean really...         "
"           I know I know...you're probably thinking, isn't Sonny doing the whole living healthy thing? I am it's just that this weekend I slipped. Well maybe not the entire weekend, lets break it down:  Friday: - went over to Carlene's in Chino Hills - watched Shrek 2 (kick ass movie) - snacked on some candies and junk food (it begins)  Saturday: - help clean up the house - wash the cars - made BBQ steak for dinner (not bad but it was late)  Sunday: - Connected and networked Carlene's mom and sister's computers to the web - Watched the Laker game - Bought and ate Bravo Burger (all hell broke loose)  Yep it was a pretty sad site. If you could only see the carnage this food caused. I mean we juss lay on the floor and couldn't move. Looked like somone dropped a bomb and we were the after-math.  So tonight it's time to hit the gym and burn off those weekend calories. Other than that I feel good and work right now isn't crazy hectic so I'm glad.  Pictures coming up soon...         "
"           If you were to look at my life right now, thats what some might say. In some aspects, my life is just that...boring. I hate to say it but I have become soooo routine.  Everyday I... • wake up • exercise • go to work • come home • Q.T. with Carlene • sleep  And it just repeats. I know once something becomes routine sooner or later it becomes boring and I fear that is what I am becoming. Partially because, and I think this could be one of the many reasons... I don't have a lot of my own set of friends here, sad but true and it's partially my own fault.  It'll be a year next month since I moved from Canada to sunny California and I must admit it's hard to make friends outside of Carlene's group of friends. I figure it was easier back in the day because I was still in school and it was just easier to meet people on a daily basis who were in your age group and had similar interests. Now that I'm done school and working the making friends thing is a little harder.  I can't use the whole...' I just moved here from Canada' bit because 1 yr is more than enough time to adjust. I need to get out more, join groups or something and I'm gonna start doing just that this weekend. Well tonight I'm heading back to Carlene's place in Chino and we might hit up a grad party, then tommorow nite is her friend's b-day so we'll do that but on Sunday I'm free to go back to Costa Mesa and figure out what there is to do. What groups are there to join around my apartment. I wanna stay away from the Club and Bar scene, I am so over that part of my life....but what else is there to do? Thats my new task, to try to make my life NOT routine and to find new and interesting things to do and if I happen to make some friends along the way bonus...  On a good note....NO MORE MOHAWK!!!! Thats right, mohawk just for one day. I couldn't take it no more so yesterday after work I went to go get it fixed. It's really short right now but it's better than what I had before...WAAAAAAY better =)  I'll start adding pix and updatiing you guys bout my new adventures real soon...         "
"           It's been a while since I had a decent hair-cut and as of late it looks like I've been in desparate need of one. Now if your anything like me I'm picky with who cuts my hair and i takes a long time to actually find a barber/salon who can cut my hair without me having to worry about wearing a hat or calling in sick the next day.  I had that comfort zone with a particular salon back in Canada and they've been cutting my hair for over 7 yrs. But now I moved to Cali, things have changes and I have to start from scratch. Son in my search I've had to deal with 'Super Cuts' and 'Fantastic Sams' and even a place called 'Hair Cutters'. They all were decent cuts but not really to my liking.  My search lead me to what was near my apartment which I have just moved into recently so I'm still getting familiar with the area. And what do you know, there's a Paul Mitchell Salon just round' the corner from my apartment. Carlene had taken the liberty of making an appointment for me @ 8pm last nite. I was happy that it would only cost me $10, sweetness...but did I mention it was a Paul Mitchell SCHOOL!?  Yep I had agreed to get my hair cut done by a student with full knowledge my hair is no easy task, with 3 collics in my head, weird shape and on top of that my hair cut before was masacred by a little asian lady who cut my hair wearing over-sized latex gloves....At first I thought wow she must be very hygenic but not too smart wearing gloves that are too big while cutting peoples hair with sharp tools! Then I saw posters on the wall with her in a doctors uniform and the big gloves toting a pair of sheerss with the headline saying : 'Who's gonna operate on your head today?'  Fear and disbelief filled my mind and sure enuff she messed up my head...But all thats ok now since I'm going to The Paul Mitchell School to get it fixed right? Well I get in at 8 and I wait for say 15 mins. The place is packed, I guess a lot of people were wiling to get their heads done so I wasn't so worried at that moment. Then I hear my name called out and this guy Justin comes out, a punk-ish into the import car scene kinda guy. Nice guy but.....in the two hours it took for him to cut my hair he managed to butcher my head all the while I'm thinking 'it's gonna get better, it's gonna get better, I don't have my glasses on so it must look ok, it's gonna get better'.....  2 hrs later and I walk out with a wack ass MOHAWK!!!!!!! k it's not too bad but a mohawk??....I don't think I'll be heading back to that slaughter house anytime soon. Maybe it's because I go my hair cut done by a phase one student, I should have got it done by a phase two for $5 more...Dammit. Oh well hair is hair and it'll grow back rite? *forced smile*  I think I'll head to a salon after work to get it fixed.....*ponders the thought*  To be continued....         "
"           '...and now I hit publish...dammit...'  yep that kick ass blog entry I thought I had published durring my lunch break today somehow didn't go through...poop on a stick.  Maybe if I feel like it I'll re-cap what happened today later tonight, but the question of the moment is...Where is Carlene??.... she's at school =(  I got home from work and she's not here, I can't call her cell cuzz she left it at her moms....Now I know what Carlene means when she's says it sucks to be at the apartment alone....well I'll juss sit here and read some books till she gets back.  Tonight is movie night so when she gets back we'll walk to Hollywood Video ....=)         "
"           Juss saw my bank statement...it's diferent from yesterday, ALOT different. So right now I feel a little crappy.  I also finished reading my gf's blog entry about how there's a site for imaginary gf's and you have to pay for it, how sad... yeah imagine doing a spin off to that site... 'perfect boyfriends' cuzz you know perfect boyfriends are imaginary....funny stuff  Well at least tomorrow is pay day...yay         "
"           Ok...Since I lost my Clie (PDA), I know sucks ass!!!! I need to find an alternate way to give myself reminders of things to do or specific dates. So, being that I'm on the computer all day at work I might as well use my blogger for this purpose, well until I buy a new PDA oh and get Carlene one too. (I know she really wants one even though she swears by her traditional pocket organizer)  Having my own apartment is pretty cool, there's just a few things I need to get like cable...Well I can live without cable since I don't watch alot of TV plus it gets me to do other things like read books! I'm currently reading 2 books: 'Marketing Plan' by Don Debelak and 'The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership' by John C. Maxwell. I'm really diggin' both books from what little I read so far, both will help me in my future plans in terms of where I'd like my career path to go.  Well thats all for tonight, gonna watch a movie Carlene and I rented 'Girl With The Pearl Earing'.  K here's da list for 05/13/04:  - email Carlene with the response email I got from one of the graphic designers - 11am meeting with kustomerkinetics - finish outlining and color correct AJ's bags to upload to the web - make the changes for the Berkley site and upload b4 the end of the day  - work on NYX header cards and display boards           "
"           Early 90's music blasting in the office??? OH HELL YEAH!! The other day Rudy and I started talking about music and 90's music entered our convo. Names like C&C Music Factory and PM Dawn popped up.  We even found out each others obsession with Milli Vanilli. Rudy went as far as to getting his hair braided, I on the other hand had made a home music video lip syncing to 'Girl you know it's true' with a Mop head fastened to my noggin. Yea I know....dork, but you find me one person at that time when no one knew they were fakes who didn't like them....you liked them, yeah....you did.  So anywayz, that convo sparked me to download a bunch of song's from the early 90's. I even got this one mix that's 1 hr long....awwwwwwwwww g'yeah!!!!!!!!!! Let's get this party started right....let's get this party started quickly!         "
"           Well it's been a really long time since I have attempted to blog, and the truth is I was just gettin lazy and was just finding it hard to make time for it. But then tonight Carlene had told me how blogspot had a new setup for their blog sites...Comments now? Shut Up!  So we both got on the site and signed me up. This is good...getting back to blogging since my family is in Canada and I talk to them like once every 2 weeks, it gives them an outlet to see how I'm doing on a daily basis.  So with that here's the run down  to get you guys up to speed with whats happening in my life:  - I'm still with my wonderful gf Carlene - I moved into an apartment in Costa Mesa - got a kick ass bed set and mattress for choice price with help from Carlene - still with that Marketing Advertising Agency KMG and things are going well - going back to Canada June 23rd for a week to visit family and friends - Oh and did I mention I turned a quarter century last month yay  Thats all I can think of right now, I'll post some pictures up and blog in more detail soon...I miss my puppy =(          "
"            urlLink     Yep, it's official! Our little Penelope has made her way to  urlLink DOGSTER.COM!   Carlene's sister  urlLink Nicole  signed Penelope on a Friendster like website for dogs, it's cute and Penelope already has friends how funny! I better do a background check on them...hmmmmm         "
"           yes yes I know I haven't posted in a long while, for that matter my site wasn't even up so I do apologize. But now that it's back up, it's back to business.  Here's the breakdown update:  - Next week on the 29th I'll be on a plane with Carlene back to Canada to visit my family and friends whom I haven't seen in roughly 1 yr.  - My company is moving to another building so new environment new energy, just good things all around   Um there's more but I'm on my lunch break and it's almost over so I gotta bounce. I'll be back later tonight to finish this update =)         "
"           (The Scenario) On my way to work, driving on the 5 fwy and I start to have an un-easy feeling. Can't quite explain it but something inside me felt weird. No it wasn't the food or the hooka I had last night with Carlene, Jill and Sarah (That was fun btw, Jill and Sarah are welcome anytime at the Apt.), it was something else.  So I arrive at the office on time and punch in. Lorraine (my co-worker) arrives soon after. I begin the usual 'Good morning' and proceed with small talk. The topic of the last episode of 24 came up and she was telling me about bombs attached to some guys arm and having to chop it off with an axe, more bombs and terrorists ish....  *ring, ring*  All eyes on the office phone...I pick it up.  Me - 'Good morning, Kurianski Media Group' Caller - *muffled*  'What suite are you?' Me - 'Pardon me? You'll have to speak louder, it's very difficult to hear you...'  *now un-muffled I can hear him clearly this time with a middle eastern accent*  Caller -  'What suite are you? I am outside RIGHT NOW!'  *After talking bout 24 with bombs and terrorists, my mind starts running and I must admit I was a little thrown off*  Me - 'um...who do you want to see or what is this concerning?' Caller - 'I am outside! Tell me where you are!'  --  Turns out he's this dude who's supposed to pick up a CD with files he's paying for. So in the end he wasn't some guy who wanted to bomb my place of work. He just wanted a CD and gave me $60 for it.  I knew it all along... ;)         "
"           The time now is 11:08 am. As I have said earlier the company I work for  urlLink KMG , has just moved to  a new building and so today a guy named 'Gus' from ADT is installing the system.  Seems like a normal day so far untill I walk past him while he's on the ladder... Not before, not after I pass him but while I am right beside him...he lets one RIP!!!! *FART* Oops he's says with a childish grin. Man right at that moment I was filled with so many mixed emotions, I didn't know weither to say gross out loud, gag and say 'excuse me I'mma go shower now'.  Yep this day seems interesting already...         "
"           I know I know... I promised to update more frequently and I'm not. It's just that ever since I got back from Canada it's been hectic here in sunny Cali. Work especially has been a whirl-wind of over-time to catch up on jobs and to complete new ones, oh and did I mention we moved to a new building!?  So on top of all that work we had to deal with the move durring the week. Now that we're here at the new building we still got to paint the walls cuzz you know to be a Marketing/Advertising/Design Firm we can't just have plain white walls, we need some splashes of color to get our creative juices flowing =) We're also removing the grey carpet and putting down hardwood.  I have taken some pictures of our move and the new location so I will post that up a little later. Also I got pix from rafting, not the pix you've seen already on Carlene's or Nicole's site but ACTION shots supa coooool hahaha.  Ne wayz I will post that all real soon but for now I gotta get back to work, just wanted to post to make sure that the one or two of the people that do read my daily ramblings besides Carlene and her sis know that I am posting and that this site is not static...er stagnet...or whatever you wanna call it... I posted dammit! THERE!   -- peas         "
"           Yep after a long hiatus I'm back. Sorry I haven't been updating as much, I've just been real busy with work and all which I will get into later but first.....  Picture Time!!! I just got back from Canada the other week for a long overdue visit. I haven't been back home in a year so it was real nice seeing family and friends again. So scroll down and enjoy the pix, more to come.

"    Time....How many of us seem to think we never have enough of it or how it doesn't pass quickly enough for us....Time has got to be a figment of our imagination...Because it never seems to be like we need it to be LOL....It's been a busy few days. All of a sudden the hope I had that my book would be published has become a reality and now of course time is of the essence....  This leaves me in a very quirky predictament.... Why? Because now the story that is directly from my heart, as well as my life will be public and open to scrutiny...Whoa....What a concept eh? I always did believe 'be careful what you wish for...You just might get it!'   I got it!   In other strands of my life, things are picking up with sweets...Interestingly enough it is an oddity to be in love with someone and not be sexually active at all. Sweets and I have never been sexually active with one another for no other reason then we haven't gone that far yet...Today I was laughed at by someone because we didn't live together or have a sexual relationship...Of course then she went into a tirade about the very husband she lives with and has sex with....hmmm...She's miserable doing the very thing sweets and I haven't. Not sure why she laughed....Seems to me the fact that we are happy and she and her hubby are not speaks volumes.....  People...Go figure...Their as enigmatic as time....  "
"    I had to take a breather from working...once again I found myself getting lost in the world of my book and within the feelings of the characters...ugh, I hate that! Sometimes while writing I become so engrossed in what the characters are feeling, my own feelings seem to die off. That's so hard to shake off and probably one of the main reason's I started this....to have a safe place to regain my sanity after writing for hours on end.   I probably should write some about who I am, however I am going to continue to remember the old adage 'anything you say can and will be used against you...' The last thing I need is for someone to equate this blog with my pen name and say wow I know where so and so writes her thoughts at...LOL    So I little about me; where to begin? I am a 35 year old female. I have no family left alive so essentially I am all alone in this world now. Most find that disheartening, I have found it almost easier to be alone then to deal with the family ties. I am a tiny person standing just under 5 foot tall and weighing less then 95lbs. I am definately a secure person, and while some might assume I am cocky or arrogant I am actually just very self assured and comfortable with my looks and who I am.  I honestly hate describing myself so other then the above description I think I will not bother. Spirit knows I don't need this to sound like some bad personal add....LOL  Obviously my passion is my work, otherwise I wouldn't become so wrapped up in it and need an escape of some sort. Due to my work I often spend time alone, although I wouldn't call myself a 'loner'...I do enjoy the company of others as long as they aren't stupid. Stupid people are my biggest pet peeve. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something, thereby having to acquire the knowledge...but when your just plain stupid.....ack that kills me..... Of course the world would be pretty dull without stupid people...but none the less, I could stand to see a lot less of them!  Well I have wasted enough useless brain cells babbling here for now...I had best get back to work....hopefully soon I can pull myself away from my work enough to work on this blog...Keep your fingers crossed!   "
"     There is nothing more exciting then moving into and learning more about a new home...during the day today that is precisely what I am doing. Since I have never blogged before learning the various way that I can change, manipulate and operate this thing is providing me with a new diversion for my already too busy mind. I should be working but what the hell right?  "
"   I guess this is home sweet home now..... "

"        I don't know what's up with me. But, for some reason I can't get out of this funk. At work, I only do what I need to get by. At home, I don't answer the phone. Clean my house, have a drink and veg out in front of the TV. I know I should go work out, but don't have the energy to do it. It's only across the parking lot from me! This is how lazy I am! I know it would make me feel better, look better and it's free. I'm tired all of the time and just want to sleep. I'm already on prozac, and have upped my prescription once already this year! Haven't been to the shrink in awhile, but I don't think she was doing anything for me anymore. But, listening to my stories. She use to recommend self help books, now she recommends trashy novels with characters that do things I would do! Yeah...I wasn't looking for another gal pal!  Let's see, my 3 biggest stresses are...   Bills/debt:   I can't get ahead! I've cut way back on spending money and still, can't get ahead! I guess it's because I am still not use to having to pay rent! I haven't had to for the past 5 years. I'm pretty much use to spending what I want, when I want! On stupid shit! No more stupid shit for me, which sucks!! I haven't bought a new pair of shoes since April! And, I'm use to buying at least one pair a week! Thinking about getting a part time job during the holidays.   Weight Issues:   If I were to spend more time working out, I would look better, feel better, sleep better etc. I know all of that, I just am having a hard time finding the motivation to get off my ass and do it! I thought about doing something childish like giving my self a star when I work out, and when I get 20 stars, getting a pedicure or something like that! Then, that brings me back to issue #1 and being stressed about debt!   Friends:   I've lost touch with some of my friends since the 'break-up'.  There is a whole group that were 'his' friends and a group that were/are mine. Here's the thing...most of my friends are married! Which was fine when I was in a relationship and thought that I was in a similar place as my married friends. Now, I find that I don't have as much interest in looking at toys, baby clothes, talking about child birth, their kids etc. Not to mention feel like a 3rd wheel when doing things with them, or the fucking nanny. Now that I'm single, I realize that I have very few friends that are single too! Which is a bit depressing!     I guess I'm just feeling alone and sorry for myself. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better and brighter day!      "
"           Why do I feel like I didn't get a weekend?  I didn't do a damn thing all weekend. Left the house 2 times, didn't answer the phone or call anyone. Which really isn't like me. I guess I needed a break! Today, I feel like I could sleep for the rest of the week. I need to work out, take drugs or something!  The ex was suppose to come by this weekend and drop off the rest of my shit. I ignored the phone when he called. Didn't feel like dealing with him or being nice. After all, do you know how many times I had to wait on his ass for a call returned? Lots! Let the bastard think I was 'to busy'.  Didn't hear from the 'F.B.' this weekend. Left him one message on Saturday night. His phone was turned off..hmmm...Suspicious! I think he started a new job today, so I'm taking bets on when I will hear from him again...I'm going with Wednesday (of which week, I'm not sure)      "
"            Is he just a fuck buddy or is this going somewhere?   Okay...a little history! Just got out of an 8 year relationship that ended in January. Lived together for 4 years. He just kind of decided he wasn't happy and hadn't been for the past year. Nice of him to let me know huh! Was devastated for about a month, cried a lot, drank a lot, then got my shit together, moved out and moved on. Realizing that it would have never worked out in the long run, it was a blessing in disguise and all of that other crap!  So then...Meet a guy at a bar in May (I know, never a good sign.) Gave him my number, he called the next week. Talked for awhile, we both had plans to be out of town the next 3-4 weekends. Decided to get together when we were both back in town. In the meantime, I'm close to his house, at a bar, call him up around midnight and he comes to meet me for a drink. Gave me a little smooch good bye. Don't hear from him for awhile, then he calls, wants to get together, we go for a drink, we go back to my place, fool around and well....you know! I have to say I didn't regret a single moment of it. So, we're suppose to go out the following weekend, I don't hear from him. Left him the 'what is up with you?' message. Hear from him again the following week, I ask if we are done here ior what. He says not at all, blah blah blah, I cave and ask him to come over. Do you see a pattern forming here? So, I don't hear from him for 3 weeks...just when I've decided to completely write him off and delete his number from my cell phone. He calls!!! Says he's been out of town for 3 weeks, coming home tonight, let's get together soon. So, we go out to dinner a few nights later, have lots of drinks, come back to my place, open a bottle of wine and well...you know! We both go out town the following weekend, (not together), he calls when he gets back and stays over.  Here is the thing. I do like him, but really don't know  him  all that well, or what his deal is. We get along great, are very attracted to each other, are totally comfortable with each other, which we both admitted was a little creepy.   He says he's a very 'private' person, which I interpret as 'a lying, cheating, sneaky bastard.' I found myself actually trying to catch him in lies. (I think because my ex use to lie about stupid shit all the time.) But, I was not successful! Which you would think would be a good sign, but it just confuses me.       "

"             Well, I just bought a house and it's a little daunting to think that I am going to be a homeowner soon.  There are so many wonderful and scary things going through my mind.  I know everything will be okay, but it just seems odd that I am not going into this situation with anyone.  This was never a dream of mine.  I always thought I would meet someone, get married and then find a 'home.'  So much for dreams.  I am very thankful though.  I understand that everything has a purpose and, while not currently apparent, that I will see the light at some point.  I have so much going on in my life right now.    There are so many wonderful people in this world and I wish I could tell each one of them how grateful I am for their love and support.  There is a certain family that I am so proud to be helping.  I was able to give the father a job to help them pay the bills and to put food on the table.  I don't want any thanks or recognition for that, because it wasn't me who gave him that opportunity, it was Him.  I just wish that He would give me the ability to touch others the way I have touched this one family.  I am grateful for everything I am given; the good and the bad.  This may sound random as it is, completely, but I feel as though I need to start taking a journal.  God Bless you all.         "
"             On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,' said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.   Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.' He just knew what it was.   'Oh my,' he shuddered, 'its Satan and the Lord dividing the souls at the cemetery.' He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. 'Come here quick,' said the boy. 'You won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.' The man said, 'Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.' When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled to the cemetery.   Standing by the fence they heard, 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me ...'The old man whispered, 'Boy, you've been telling the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord himself.'   Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.   At last they heard, 'One for you, one for me.' And one last 'One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done.'   (They say the old man made it back to town five minutes ahead of the boy on the bike!)          "
"             'Tomorrow morning,' the surgeon began, 'I'll open up your heart...'   'You'll find Jesus there,' the boy interrupted.   The surgeon looked up, annoyed 'I'll cut your heart open,' he continued, to see how much damage has been done...'   'But when you open up my heart, you'll find Jesus in there,' said the boy.   The surgeon looked to the parents, who Sat quietly. 'When I see how much damage has been done, I'll sew your heart and chest back up, and I'll plan what to do next.'   'But you'll find Jesus in my heart. The Bible says He lives there. The hymns all say He lives there. You'll find Him in my heart.'   The surgeon had had enough. 'I'll tell you what I'll find in your heart. I'll find damaged muscle, low blood supply, and weakened vessels. And I'll find out if I can make you well.'   'You'll find Jesus there too. He lives there.'   The surgeon left.   The surgeon sat in his office, recording his notes from the surgery, '...damaged aorta, damaged pulmonary vein, widespread muscle degeneration. No hope for transplant, no hope for cure. Therapy: painkillers and bed rest. Prognosis:, ' here he paused, 'death within one year.'   He stopped the recorder, but there was more to be said. 'Why?' he asked aloud. 'Why did You do this? You've put him here; You've put him in this pain; and You've cursed him to an early death. Why?'   The Lord answered and said, 'The boy, My lamb, was not meant for your flock for long, for he is a part of My flock, and will forever be. Here, in My flock, he will feel no pain, and will be comforted as you cannot imagine. His parents will one day join him here, and they will know peace, and My flock will continue to grow.'   The surgeon's tears were hot, but his anger was hotter. 'You created that boy, and You created that heart. He'll be dead in months. Why?'   The Lord answered, 'The boy, My lamb, shall return to My flock, for He has Done his duty: I did not put My lamb with your flock to lose him, but to retrieve another lost lamb.'   The surgeon wept.. The surgeon sat beside the boy's bed; the boy's parents sat across from him. The boy awoke and whispered, 'Did you cut open my heart?'   'Yes,' said the surgeon.   'What did you find?' asked the boy.   'I found Jesus there,' said the surgeon.            "

"       Wow, what a nice concert. The Texas A&M small ensemble class was performing some classical pieces and one contemporary classical as I might say today in St. Mary's Catholic Church. I was first bored to death hearing the 'not-so-coherently-played' flutes, clarinets, oboe and stuff played at the beginning of the concert. Just as I was thinking of leaving the concert, well I was also trying to decide whether I'm going to kneel and making a cross sign when I leave or not since I was in the church, but not in a mass, so there I was sitting so everly confused and bored with all those tutty-futty flutes and clarinets. Then just as I build my strength to get up, the music proffesor introduce the last group of ensemble, which is the 'TROMBONE ENSEMBLE'. I was like, WOOOWWW, forget the kneeling, forget me leaving, cause I'm staying..urrgghhh, I'm so boring. Then!!!, this trombone ensemble start to play, man, eight trombone players, set like a whole orchestra with the high, middle, and low arrangement thing. GODD, the play took me back to my junior and high school time. I remember just how fun it was to play my trombone with thw whole brass section....anyway, the last repertoire thay played was a jazz music. Ok, it's jazz and trombone, together, heck, I'm staying till the end of the show. Maybe I should've read the program before the show, anyway, the piece was perfect. I was clapping, without thinking like when I was deciding to kneel or not. Then, I went to talk with one of the trombone player. So then I decided, I'll take the class this summer, however, I still have to look for a slide trombone, since my trombone is a valve kind. Shoot, I wish my birthday was in May.     "

"       Tarombo&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Went to St. Mary this Monday cause I haven't been there for about three weeks or more. The theme that day was about honoring grandparents. So at the end of the sermon this new priest I don't even know his name told us to say in our heart the name of our own grandparents. Now I see a problem. I only know my paternal grandmother. I've never met my mother's parents and my father's father. I'm trying really hard to remember any of their names. I remembered my father's grandfather's name, Johannes, which is really rare for an Indonesian name. I think it's because at that time Catholic has become a common religion in the area where my father came from so they started using their baptist name. So I went home while trying hard to remember my grandfather's name. Today, while browsing at my sister's happily neglected web site, I found this Tarombo, which is the family tree from my father's side. So I hurriedly look at the name of my grandfather, I read it and I found it to be another european name, but right next to it his Indonesian name is written in parenthesis, Raja Doli, which is my middle name. Since I came to America, I've never used my middle name anywhere, or just put an initial anytime I need to fill a form requiring my middle name, so it's been five years not hearing people calling me with my middle name, except whenever I meet this Brazilian friend of mine who calls me by my full name everytime we meet. But I hardly ever meet that guy anymore. Now I remember that my father told me when I was a kid that my grandfather gave me his name. I used to ignore that story, but now I see the story in totally different way.      "

"        David Sedaris: the Antonia Vardalos of Best-Selling Author   Growing up, I'm never good with people's name. I used to address all my teachers by the subject they're teaching, Miss Biology, Mister Math and stuff. It's not that I don't respect my teachers, but it's just hard to remember people's name that you don't see at least 12 hours a day. I don't even know the name of those new emerging bands whose songs I like and remember all the lyrics. When somebody told me a joke about how you can get around when you meet an old friend but forgot their name, so you say '..so how do you spell your name' and your old friend would say ' B O B ', and you say ' ahh...I thought there was a hidden M there', I was thinking of using it whenever I meet old friends without having any idea of what their names are. However, there is an exception on this bad habit of mine after I finished reading 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' by David Sedaris. This book is so hilarious that whenever I found myself laughing in the lab while waiting for some experiments, I turn to the first page and read the author's name again 'so what's his name?'. After finish readig the book, I've been rereading the author's name for hundreds of time, hence I can finally remember the author's name. And while reading another book written by this author, I figured out his family has major resemblance to the family in the 'My Big Fat Greek Weeding' movie by Antonia Vardalos. No wonder I like this book a lot.    "

As I remember, when I took the class all I care was to memorize them before I take the exam on the next day, now as I'm rereading the material I'm wondering of how long did it take for Chan, Ingold, and Peng to analyze the chirality of alkane to come up with their stereoisomers naming system and what analysis method did they use to figure out. And also how much research on the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in measuring the stability of one molecule conformation and how do they come up with the idea that the stability of a molecule depends on their conformation.

Once the peps and shrimps look happy (bam!) add some green bellpepper and some vegetable ( those with lots of leaves types of vegetable), after chopping them into bite sizes.  Beat two eggs together and put into the pep, shrimp, bellpepper and vegetable mix. Add some more seasoning if you like. If you have limes, squeeze half of the lime to get the juice right on top of the sauteeing stuffs, just to give a bit of a kick!  Look around in your fridge, if you have some cheese (laughing cow cheese is the best) throw some of them into the pan just before you turn the heat off so they melt beautifully.  In another pan, steam some baby carrot. (have this thing steaming at the beginning of the step)  To serve, get a bowl, put some of the steamed baby carrot (without the steaming water),&nbsp;amount undecided, and on top of them put the sauteed pep, shrimp, bellpepper, vegetable and egg from&nbsp;the other pan.  Optional: For crispiness, if you have any tortilla&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;in your fridge, broil them in the oven at 400 F for about 5 minutes or until they're really crispy. Do this sometimes before you finish sauteeing the meats and vegetable.  Pop up&nbsp;a bottle of beer or get a glass of wine or milk or water, turn off the heat in the stove and the oven, find your TV remote, turn to FoodTV Channel and start eating while watching one of those masters cooking their own food.

"        The 6th Floor   Last month somebody in the 6th floor of Richardson killed himself. My lab is in the 9th floor, which means everyday I passed the 6th floor using the elevator. Since I'm a chemical engineering student, while most of the people in Richardson are petroleum student, I don't know what really happened to the guy. Last night around 10 PM, I dropped by the lab to get some samples to do SEM on and left the lab around 11 PM. When I got into the elevator I looked at the digits indicating the floor you're passing on the elevator door. Somehow, I started to think about the incident as I watch the digits changing and it has been a habit for me to count the floors all the way to where I'm going. So it went from 9, 8, 7 and then it stopped at 6. I waited as the elevator door slided open. I think I kind of close my eyes halfway and try to blur my vision so that I won't really absorbed the spookiness or any specter flying around, I know I felt really stupid. Than the door opened perfectly and a man came in. His feet touched the floor. I was like, pheew....hahaha. I asked him if he knew anything about the news, he said yes. He said all the people in that floor try not to go into the room used to be the guy's office. It's just a sad news for people to chose to stop their live for whatever reason. I know there are a lot of obstacles, pressures and other problems people encounter and we sure will in this life, but there should be some options, even just one option, for people to chose other than killing themselves to lessen the burden they're having.

So I was pretty much starvig when I went to bed. Whenever I feel hungry while I'm sleeping, I always dream about eating some foods and wake up feeling even hungrier. Last night was kinda a different dream. I dream of eating my home country food with my family and I started eating the food with silverwear but after a while I use my hand to eat the food instead of the silverwear, and it felt really good. I guess I was hungry and homesick at the same time. The good thing is I'll get to visit my home country this fall, yeeee...great foods.    "

"             So the other night there was this huge nasty spider on my kitchen ceiling. Since Pete was here, I asked him to kindly get it and put it outside or kill it. Well being the nicest mr. peacelover that he is, he said that he wasnt going to kill it. ok- i can understand that, but at least get it down, right? well because the damn thing was in a little corner -like most spiders are- he was hard to get down. I could not sleep knowing that this spider was possibly making babies and in the morning i would have to kill 12 not just 1 so I worked up enough nerve to kill the damn thing. Now, I feel bad because Pete is so sensitive when it comes to animals and insects. Animals are one thing, but insects- man i can smash an insect or spider in no time and not think twice about it--- or so i thought till now. So people tell me what you think. To kill the spider or not to kill the spider? One of my friends gave me a good recommendation and said get a glass jar and trap the spider in that and then slide a piece of paper up behind the back of the jar and the spider will fall in that and then you can throw him out. I think next time I will have to try that.          "
"             This week has been very exhausting at school. Its really hard sitting in lecture all day listening to these wonderful designers who are so famous and successful and not being able to do anything about it. I know that it all just takes time and commitment, but I am ready to start working and really learning hands on. This week is mainly business lectures- how to set up your own business, what kinds of accounting software to use, all the specification, licensing, trade information. One of the designers who set up her company after graduating from college went on to be very successful and was contacted by ppl in japan to go over there and design restaurants, watches, clothes, etc. She said that once you are a designer, the Japanese ask you to design many different things, not just interiors.... (sigh***) someday maybe.   Well, I am starting on gathering information for my first project. I think it will be so exciting, but at the same time kind of difficult. Its only a 3 star hotel and its main competition are all 5 star hotels. But this beach resort has much better beaches and a better location so I need to start sourcing asap. Tomorrow we will get the client brief and then I can start on my design analysis. We have a long weekend- Friday and Monday off- yeah!! I can catch up on sleep!! On Saturday after work, I am going to Sheffield to visit Pete's family. I'll meet his grandmother, who is going blind. I feel so sorry for her, she wants to meet me and see Pete one more time before she is completely blind. Also, Pete's dad's birthday is coming up. I have no clue what to get men for presents- esp. since I dont know him that well. I dont want to get him anything cheesy ya know? Any suggestions?  Oh, I signed up for some online courses (like I have time i know!) but they are free and I think I will be able to learn alot. I can take courses such as HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc- it may be useful so that I can set up my own website someday.          "

"             I am completely stuffed!!! its one of those yum, im so stuffed and I just wanna sit back and watch a movie and not do anything kind of stuffed- not one of those- oh, i think i ate too much and am going to have a tummy ache one so thats good. pete and i went out to this indian restaurant we hadnt been to before and just pigged out. then we walked all the way to blockbuster and we were going to rent The Last Samuri- walked up to the counter and everything and.... i had forgotten my card and I also had Pete's card from the last time we went to BB, so we had to walk all the way back empty handed. How disappointing. So now I think Ill have to actually do some more work. Blah... Can you believe that I cant just give them my name and then rent the videos? They needed a pic id and i didnt bring my wallet out, so no luck there. oh well          "
"             I got my grades back from my last project and I did pretty well. Was quite 'chuffed' as everyone here says. My tutor said that my presentation was so strong and convincing that he thought i had come from a marketing background. NICE. anyway, just spent the last 3 hours working on my portfolio and it wasnt even a real portfolio, its just one done on powerpoint so that i can send it to prospective employers. I am quite happy with it, but i just need to change a few things. Oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the PP thing- I am fine with that, it was doing things on Adobe photoshop that took me so long. anyway, now back to my last project. I really cant wait for school to be through. to think that my evenings will actually be free- my own time -- sounds like paradise!!   oh- another good thing- it looks like ill be going to japan this summer!! yeah! im running out of my cosmetics anyway, and i only trust the japanese kind for my skin. so fun fun. lots of catching up with ppl and relatives. one of my friends is getting married!!!!

"             So Pete and I are just sitting here having a lovely dinner when all of a sudden we hear a huge CRACK and look up to see that our bay window in the living room has a gigantic hole in the window!! Some f*&#nut must have thrown a rock through our window. Who the hell would do that to us? We have no friends or enemies in Luton! Everyone we hang out with live in London. Let me just tell you one thing. LUTON SUX!!! it is the worst place! Ha- so at least you guys wont want to come and visit me. Anyway, had a nice weekend in Sheffield. But I somehow managed to pull a muscle in my back and it hurts like shit!! So I dont know what to do and all i want is sympathy. What do you do for a pulled muscle?? Never had one before...         "
"             well i just applied for two jobs today but im not holding my breath. one was for a company in London and another was for a company in Los Angelos. So what i really shouldve been doing was my work for my final project, but im thinking finding a job is a little more important. so pete informs me that our last day in this flat is july 13th! ok, thats only a little more than a month left. what are we going to do? hum... im supposed to have all this shit figured out by now, but of course things never happen like you plan so ive stopped planning. everyone says it will all fall into place, but i have yet to see that happen. i am waiting anxiously for my dream job to jump into my lap. i dont know whether to stay here in london with pete or go back to the states and get a job there. im so torn and have no clue. sometimes i just wish that someone would make up my mind for me--- because i change mine every second. for the time being, i guess just applying for jobs in london and the states will be good. but i just dont know. why give up a good thing when nothings wrong ya know? hmmm... lots to think about, but after doing some thinking over the past 9 months i havent come up with an answer so how will one more month give me the answer? yeah right.  well, its midnight. i have to get up tomorrow at 7 and commute 2 hours to school and work on my last project. fun fun.

OMG... what am i going to do?? hmmm...         "
"             Wow. it is gorgeous outside! Absolutely beautiful!... and i have to be inside drawing all day!! How annoying! I cannot wait for this project to be over. I have never done anything that consumes my life 24 hrs a day. I have already had so many dreams about this project- the presentation, the design. Isnt that crazy?  Oh, on the good side of things, I got an email from an interior design company in California who is interested in seeing my portfolio! Yeah! I would love to move to Cali- good weather, good food, and right by the ocean. Perfect! Keep your fingers crossed. I sent her my portfolio yesterday.          "
"             well, i turned in my last project today. yeah!! its all over! tomorrow, i am first up for presentations so at least ill get it over with quickly. but man am i tired!! i got an email back from the interior design company out in LA and she liked my portfolio!! yay! but i think she is looking to hire someone immediately and because i will not be back in the states till mid july, i dont know...  but yes, i finally bought my tix home- for july 10th! so i will finally after 3 years be stateside again. im getting all excited just thinking about it!

"                 I should be asleep, but I am not...instead, I am up just thinking about the past, present, and wondering what the future will hold.                 "
"                 Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10, 2004, 1:19am New York, NY  As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA, I can’t help but wonder, how “Latino” are my kids going to be?  I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S. Citizen”, your parents are immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, and you were born and raised in SOUTH EAST-LA, a part of LA that isn’t acknowledged enough.  Becoming cognizant of our multiple identities is both a blessing and a curse.  It is the complexity of our identity that makes us more interesting individuals, but it is that same complexity that makes it difficult for others to decipher who we are.  And when I say others, I mean everyone, especially we as “Latinos.”   Like many “enlightened” Latinos, I had the privilege of receiving a college education.  I recently graduated from UCSB with a degree in Art History and two minors in French and History.  Because of my major, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Bordeaux France for a year and intern at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.  It is through these experiences as well as the course work I took that I formulated ideas on who I was.  I took a Chicano Studies class and found myself wondering whether I was a Chicana or not.  I sometimes I felt obligated to consider myself Chicana because I knew the flaws associated with the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino.”  Honestly though, I felt more comfortable, and in some way prefer the term Latino over Chicano.  My reasons are entirely personal and in no way would I want to impose my preferences and biases on others. I don’t consider myself Chicana because I don’t relate to what I SEE associated with Chicanismo.  I see Chicanismo, in context to LA, as associated with second or third generation Mexicans that were once from EAST LA who don’t speak Spanish and are too distant from being “Mexican.”  First and foremost, the immigration experience of my parents is recent and it is different from the families of self-proclaimed Chicanos.  My parents came to the U.S. in 1979; my dad from Mexico fleeing poverty, my mother from El Salvador fleeing the beginnings of the civil war.  My parents never worked in a field.  In fact, I had never seen farm labor until I encountered it on the 101 ventura freeway on my way to UCSB.  My parents instead began their life here in the service sector and now work in unionized jobs in which my dad earns a middle-class salary by working 12 hour shifts, at times, 7 days a week.   In other words, my parents are an example of meritocracy.  However, I understand that my parents have lucked out; they don’t.  They view that our success is attributed to all our hard work or as they would say “Bendiciones de Dios.” What they fail to see is that not every one with their background will achieve the so-called American Dream.  And because of this, my father nags at me all the time because I should be proud and not ashamed of being born in this country.  Thinking that I know it all, I just comfort myself by seeing him as a concerned parent.  Then I think about the future, and my own kids.   For me, it is a must that my children speak Spanish.  It is a must that my children are advocates for social justice.  And most importantly, it is a must that they recognize that their socio-economic privilege is the result of their grand-parents “illegally” crossing the border to hustle in this country in give me a chance to reach my full potential.  And I fear that not happening and I fear viewing myself as a bad parent as a result of it.  But at the same time, is it fair for me to burden my children with such expectations knowing that they will be inevitably distant from my paisa experience no matter how much I try to imbed them in it?                "
"                 Life in the NYC certainly has taken its toll on me.  It is obvious by the title of this 'blog' that I am an outsider to New York.  I was born and raised in South East LA and all of sudden, I find myself living here in New York, the Upper East Side to be exact, for almost an entire year.  The reason why I came here is to teach.  I teach a bilingual Pre-K class in the South Bronx and it hast got to be the toughest job I have ever had in my life.    The reasons why this job is so difficult I will sure to reveal in future blogs.  In the meantime, I chose to focus on why my time here in New York City thus far has been bitter sweet.  It has been bitter sweet for many reasons, some superficial, some most definitely quite the contrary.  Amongst the most superficial reason I can think of is the weather.  Can't it just be freakin' sunny for one day without there being a random snow or thunderstorm?!  A reason which is a bit more profound is that, although I am physically here in NY, I am mentally and spiritually somewhere else, and now, I am not sure it's California that I lack.  What I lack is some sense of stability; a sense of security which New York has certainly taken away from me.  More so, I have become a much more cynical and vengeful person while I have been out here. I think that it has to do with the fact that every freaking day, I am confronted with the realities of the injustice that is prevalent in the world as a whole.  What makes injustice particularly unique in the U.S. and in New York City is the following.  How could poverty be so severe in the richest country in the world and one of the richest cities?  What is worse, is the racial and gender polarization that is to be found when one juxtaposes the two side by side...  I find it especially problematic living in an affluent neighborhood in which I am often mistaken for a service worker.  Motherfu**ers livin' in this neighborhood have become so accustomed to seeing people that 'look like me' serving them that they automatically assume that my presence in their space is not one cohabitation, rather, servitude.  I saw fu** them!  Yesterday I read an article in the New York Times that basically suggested, 'If you believe in that meritocracy bu**sh**, for working 90 hours a week, you still get to be dirt poor, sexually harassed, wash clothes that you could never afford, and basically can't do sh** about it cause we'll call INS on you...WELCOME TO THE AMERICAN DREAM.'  If it isn't obvious by now, I am pretty angry at the system in which we are forced to function in.  Perhaps for those that are a part of the dominant class, it is not so problematic given that they benefit from the exploitation of others.  But for me it is and something needs to be done.  That something will be explored in another post.               "
"                 I am in my graduate class right now and I am having a hard time trying to seem at least half interested.  This is straight out bu**sh**! I can't believe that it has taken me this long to realize that instead of doodling, I could be writing!  Oh writing, how I miss you so!  You are my one escape that won't abandon me, rather, I would be the one to abandon you.  You are my one escape that I could have at all times, without having to fear that you'll fu** up my health.  You are my one addiction that I don't have to join an 'anonymous' group for!  I need to get my ish together and begin hustling again.  Every hustler has a game plan except me; thus, I need o start formulating mine.  I need to start reading the ECONOMIST and the WALL STREET JOURNAL!  I need to learn how to befriend the enemy, only to backstab him or her in the end...  It feels like I have been so detached from thinking critically, that I feel as though my ability to analyze, to a certain degree, has become mediocre.  I can't believe people actually participate in this class.  It is such an insult to my intelligence.  I feel like these fuc**ers just talk to show off and listen to themselves speak!  I'm scared to go back to real graduate school.  I have forgotten what it is like to actually produce though provoking papers and having endless discussions on identity politics...I need to learn how to be in a position of power and execute decisions that will create social justice...

"             Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.  I'm contemplating giving up my car, that I worked hard for, but you want to go on buying fucking toys?!  Not going to happen!         "

"       I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay! I love the game, but really!          "
"       my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me... they are nice. I usually buy a handful when I go to play adnd with the guys, playing adnd is nice.. no actually it's awesome fun, very geeky, but hell what do I care! What matters more in the world than enjoying yourself with good friends? not much, that I can assure you.           "

"           It’s 11:15 in the morning, and my stomach and head are at war. It’s Day One of Phase One of the South Beach Diet revisited, which means I’m on a strict, imbibe-no-crap regimen. It’s also the day we take my co-worker to lunch for her birthday. The Birthday Lunch is a ritual that began when people lived in caves. You can see it on the walls at Lascaux – the piercing eyes of stick figure cavemen imploring, asking the birthday caveman how his mastodon tastes. He responds with a tentative grunt, self-conscious, polite. They make small talk and navigate uncomfortable pauses by taking keen interest in their food. Later, there’s cake.   Apparently, we have not progressed. The co-worker assigned to round up the troops lets us know the Birthday Lady has decided on Olive Garden.   Olive Garden.   Olive Garden, where I can eat exactly one thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar Salad, and watch the rest of my table feed on sumptuous-smelling breadsticks. Olive Garden, where they serve you salad family style before bringing your meal, which means I will eat redundantly, salad followed by salad. Olive Garden, where the A/C is cranked to nipple-hardening, lip-numbing temperatures, where they bring you full glasses of iced tea rather than just fill your half-filled glass, leading you to feel a contractual obligation to drink more tea, where you are indeed a pawn in some waiter’s kill-the-lunchtime-boredom game of Customer Iced Tea Drinking Races, where the waiter will mention I look tired at lunch when, really, I look ripped-off and petulant, the result of being dragged, not exactly against my will but not exactly out of instinctual, let’s-eat-there impulse, to Olive Garden.  They seat seven of us at a ten-top and won’t seat us at the eight-top the next table over because that’s the “training section.” This means we are assuredly in the hands of professionals. Our professional waiter saunters over, suggestive-sells us drinks (we decline), suggestive-sells us appetizers (we decline), and hands us menus, thinking us cheap and unfestive, which is not altogether inaccurate.   I look at the menu, scan the items, confirming the worst. Carboload. Carbomax. Carblicious. Carbohydrate Surprise. Carb To My Lou. Carbeteria. Chicken Caesar Salad. Defeatedly, I place my order, and settle into a randomly-firing conversation about negligent boyfriends, mundane vacation spots, and death.  No matter how witty your co-workers, no matter how much lemon butter is drizzled over the main course chicken, no matter how quick and efficient your waiter, Birthday Lunch is the Hindenburg of lunch dates. If you live in an office with politics, they will edge the bare spots in conversation and poke through like weeds to sidewalks. If you cannot speak frankly and openly under the flourescent lights of your office, you are doomed to fail under the non-descript light of a chain restaurant.   Tempers will flare. Envy will lick its lips and look for a hand mirror. Ennui will take a silent roll through the gates in a giant wooden horse. Birthday Lunch will make you pine for other discomforting engagements, like College Reunion Karaoke Night, or Acquaintance Strip Club Bachelor Party, or Obscure Relative Closed-Casket Funeral.   And then, later, there’s cake.  If you are dieting, cake means watching other people eat cake. It means singing-in-public punishment and then declining cake reward. It means wearing a forced smile and drinking from a comically-oversized glass of water in a valiant effort to feel full, compliments on your willpower, tsk-tsk chiding from those who can’t resist pointing out, “You don’t know what you’re missing,” when, in fact, you do. It means 15 minutes of conversation with the entire office as difficult to predict as roulette. Could be boredom, could be agitation, could be earnestly funny and the highlight of the work day, could be harrowing cryptic precursor to layoffs and reassignments and general work-related doom.   At the point in the proceedings you wish your parents were there, so you could ask to be excused from the table, you may beg off and return your cubicle and let your email and your homepage of choice and your personalized screensaver soothe you back into the space that is no longer shared, to the refreshing consolation that though no man is an island, sometimes, you get to be relatively close to an island – perhaps, an isthmus.  And, if you are like me, you know that sometime in the next 364 days, the discomfort of the Birthday Lunch will be on your behalf. And if you are like me, you can’t predict the level of angst or boredom or restless fuss that will tether itself to your day. But you will know, at least, that you will have your pick of restaurants, and one guess as to where you won’t be dragging the rest of the office.           "
"           (cross posted to  urlLink The Symposium :)  I remember it all too well. Several days before the tension-filled Election Day 2000, in which conservatives feared the Gore hydra head would sprout from the Clinton neck, and liberals feared the return-to-fascism movement sure to result from electing Bush II: Electric Boogaloo, one of my friends sent me a blog link that laid out just how the election could end in a tie.  Preposterous, I thought, until I actually squinted at the numbers and saw just how such a break was within the realm of possibilities. The states in play could have, with just the right nudges here and there, dispensed the 538 electoral votes evenly, 269 for each side.  Of course, we ended up with something far worse: the limbo in Florida, which effectively put the election into the hands of the nine Supreme Court justices. In other words, when Bush the Elder was effectively able to imbue the Clarence Thomas hearings with an innocent-until-proven-guilty climate more suitable for a courtroom (which it felt like) rather than a job interview (which it actually was), he was setting the table for the deciding vote that would, about a decade later, allow his son to take over the ultimate family business.   The country, for better or for worse, healed from the mess of the elections, and Bush was inaugurated with no more glee from the winning side or bitterness from the losing side as in past elections – the losing side invoked more robbery motifs this time around, but do you really think the left hated GWB any less than the Bush with four initials or Reagan or Nixon? The continuum of jealousy and hate for the losing side just transfers from elected candidate to elected candidate. The fact that GWB couldn’t even muster a popular majority made it a little worse, but in the end, he was our president, and it wasn’t like any buildings had collapsed or anything.  Actually, that came eight months after the inauguration, and in the crumbling ruins of the World Trade Center and the damaged wall of the Pentagon came the purpose of the Bush presidency. He went from ineffectual gee-whiz boy king to aggressive ideologue with conviction in several epoch-defining hours. Somehow, along the way, Bush has invaded and invoked a successful regime change in Afghanistan without finding the one person we wanted to find in the invasion, and has attempted and is currently floundering with regime change in larger, more advanced, and infinitely more complex Iraq.  That, in conjunction with a foundering economy that is only now, arguably, beginning to find its way again after two years of recession and three years of negative job growth, makes the 2004 election a referendum on Bush. As a staunch liberal, I’d like to think that this truly is a choice between Bush and Kerry, except Kerry has become something of a non-entity so far – merely a “not Bush” box to x or not x.  Kerry, to make a crass analogy, became the most convenient Democrat for the party faithful to bed, after we realized that Dean was too “hot,” as the pundits have labeled him, or as we like to call him post-scream post-Iowa, “totally crazy.” If this campaign was a night out on the town, Kerry was the one we started dancing with about 1 a.m. (Iowa), went home with for the night at closing time (Super Tuesday), and have now woken up next to at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning (mid-May polls, showing Bush and Kerry in a statistical dead heat), not quite sure if we should go out to breakfast with him or let him sleep, stuff our panties in our purse, and take the walk of shame back to our apartment. But we haven’t just had a one-night stand with him; we’ve pinned our hopes on him to somehow become the 44th President of the United States. We recognize his shortcomings, and yet, we’re stuck with him.  And now, we're just plain stuck -- the AP-Ipsos poll released last week show that there's a deadlock in electoral votes at this juncture, six months before the election. 205 votes seem to have been locked up by the incumbent, and 205 seem to have been locked up by the challenger. What we have left is 128 electoral votes, dispersed among 12 states, to be divvied up between the two people left, in a nation of 250 million, who have a realistic shot of seeing us through the next four years.   And no, Nader’s not a viable option. To the left, Nader is a galling presence, an egomaniac who is going to suck votes from the disenchanted left – votes that would otherwise have nowhere else to turn but to Kerry as the anti-Bush.   This is perhaps not a shocking revelation, but once again, the election might boil down to what happens in Florida. Other states are up for grabs, of course, and some of them, including the Pacific Northwest states and the Rust Belt states, seem like they might swing Kerry’s way. Arkansas, despite the Clinton residue, seems like it’s ultimately Bush territory, and even though Missouri and Iowa proved key states in Kerry’s walk to the nomination, they’re still so surrounded by Red America states that the peer pressure might swing at least one of them Bush’s way.   What we might see, ironically, for the second time in four years, is the winner of the popular vote losing the electoral vote. Unless something dramatic happens in the next six months (the capture of Osama Bin Laden, a drastic change of fortunes in Iraq, a dramatic spike in jobs gained or economic numbers), I’m seeing the American public remain polarized, and I’m seeing Nader’s possible jump to the Reform Party (which gives him access to the ballot in Florida, Michigan, and five other states) having a decisive effect on the total electoral ballots.  As we look to see polling numbers for New Mexico and Nevada in the coming months, as we bite our nails over the numbers coming out of Ohio and Florida, and as we’re ignoring three-fourths of the states under the assumption they are foregone conclusions, we’ll have plenty of opportunity to wring our hands about the electoral college system – particularly one set up for a 269-269 tie. On one hand, it’s brilliant, in that it forces candidates to go state-by-state, addressing myriad issues in a variety of American landscapes. But for voters like me, in perhaps the reddest of Red America states, in a city where we just voted down giving our mayor and city council members a livable wage by a 2-1 margin, in a Congressional district recently reconfigured at the behest of Tom DeLay, it feels as futile to cast my ballot for John Kerry in 2004 as it did for Al Gore in 2000.   In Florida and New Mexico, in the 2000 election, a college auditorium’s worth of itinerant drifters voting as a block could have shifted the presidency to Gore or shored up Bush’s numbers. I’m not saying voter turnout should include buses and cheap apartments for adventurous post-college wayfarers willing to live in Ohio long enough to punch a ballot a particular way, but if you live in Texas, California, the South, or New England, don’t expect many Bush/Cheney commercials to get in the way of your summer reruns.   If you live in the handful of states that will actually matter, though, steady yourself for the barrage. Kerry made a point throughout the primaries to talk about how much he loved Iowa. As one of the battleground states for ’04, he’s going to love it so much you’ll think he wants to marry it. And in the non-battleground states, we’ll get to hear every rhapsodic word from Bush and Kerry, and be jealous.  And as long as we don’t cheat on either of them with a Nader vote, they won’t care.         "
"           The sunrise in Las Vegas is not like sunrise in the rest of the world. Which is quite fortunate for the rest of the world.   You see, for most of the world, sunrise is the most purposeful time of day. For most of the world, save for the poor souls working night shift, morning is get-at-it time. The first few lemon-yellow rays appear in the east, the twittering machine of birds starts up, lights click off as punctuation. They're all signals to get moving, to start a new day, to brew coffee and read the paper and embark on whatever rituals we've adopted in the dubious but crucial goal of getting from a prone position on a bed to an upright position in an office.   If you've been to Las Vegas, you know that sunrise is the one time of day Las Vegas looks completely out of synch with itself. Yes, if you look hard at the hotels along the Strip, you can still see signs that life exists in the way we'd expect it to in Vegas. Cab drivers are moving tourists out of the hotels, with the implicit promise they'll be moving more in later in the day. A few stragglers, presumably placing their faith in a law of averages that rewards their tenacity, are seated at slot machines in windowless and massive hotel lobby casinos. You can even see a few people who have taken it upon themselves to honor some unspoken code of Vegas, literally partying all night, retreating to their hotel rooms. Some of them even manage to not look bleary and shaky doing so.   For a city that prides itself on nightlife and makes its fortune on gambling and is awash in thousands upon thousands of electric lights, sunrise is a caesura more than an event. It's when Vegas is least like Vegas, and is more like any other decent-sized American city in which people struggle with their alarm clocks, fumble their way to consciousness, and fill the air with smog on their way from the house to the job.   Of course, to most of those who visit Vegas each year -- the literal millions of them -- they're not likely to see sunrise. This is probably one of the few times in their lives they not only get to sleep in, but feel they are expected to.   Even if you tell yourself you're merely in observation mode, and you're driving around Vegas at sunrise with the resolve to not get sucked in by Vegas's temptations (and the resultant smugness that comes with it), know that Vegas is aiming one of its sequined arrows at your heart. It knows you have a weakness -- that there is something base and carnal within you that cries out for fulfillment. The billboards will seek you out. There are seven deadly sins. If it's not a high-level vice like sex or gambling, maybe it's something on the order of hobnobbing with Klingons at the Hilton's  Star Trek: The Experience  or eating a sushi dinner.  At nightfall, Vegas truly becomes Vegas, blotter-thick with images that either find their way onto postcards or are judiciously airbrushed from postcards: the lights, the buffets, the rows of street urchins clicking their escort services ad cards in the hopes you will make eye contact with them (which pretty much dooms you to taking one, and you only make that mistake once), the come-hither enticement of rows of slot machines, and come to think of it, the slippery-voweled double entendre of 'loose slots.'  At nightfall, Vegas becomes the full manifestation of Vegas. Vegas the city becomes Vegas the archetype. At sunrise, Vegas is something else entirely, but it's still not nearly as dormant as the majority of its tourists are.  Vegas at sunrise, you see, is not resting. It's reloading.    I’m sure this is not a novel thesis, but it’s one that bears repeating and reinforcing, so we can better understand our nation’s love affair with Las Vegas – the love that makes the little desert outpost that is McCarran International Airport the eighth busiest airport in the world. Las Vegas, even without a major sports franchise [1], even though it is currently ranked between Louisville and Jacksonville as the 51st largest media market in the nation, is the ultimate American city. New York might have the history and the melting pot, Los Angeles may have the most fertile climate for rags-to-riches ascent, Washington D.C. is the seat of power, and a number of cities would lay claim to being the most representative of the current America or the new, burgeoning America, depending on what thesis on America circa 2004 you’re trying to forward. But nowhere is the drive to consume, defended to the death as the pursuit of happiness, more evident than in Las Vegas – which makes Las Vegas, to me at least, the ultimate American city.    Vegas is where countless Americans come to play, and though there's not the sense that you can find everything you want in Vegas, like there is New York, there's definitely the sense that you can have your pleasure sensors suitably sated and diverted by its range of offerings. Chances are, you're not going to find that obscure album you've been scouring the bins of your mid-American record stores for in Las Vegas, but that same desire to be entertained will be filled by a stage show which will attempt to justify its ticket price in a sheer display of over-the-topness.   Go down the list of the fancier Strip hotels, and you can tick down the fantasy locations of a broad cross-section of Americans, depositing them in their choice of comfortable, dangerless recreations of where they'd most like to be. The Paris, the Monte Carlo, and the Venetian all conjure up images of a well-to-do, come-on-in-Americans version of Europe which may not be so welcoming in the George W. Bush era. The Mirage is a mélange of tropical settings which, through a name suggesting the windows of the imagination, isn't bound by any sort of geographical assignation whatsoever. The Excalibur, Caesars Palace and the Luxor opt for taking the guest back to a time in which their setting was the most desirous location to the people of that epoch -- certainly similar to how Americans view the United States of today. The Bellagio, though it hints at an Italian theme, seems to shoot for an aesthetic based on pure wealth.   If you look closely at the signs in front of what will become Wynn's, the newest and shiniest of the Strip hotels, you can see construction permit signs that read 'La Reve.' According to the Vegas native who served as my de facto tour guide for my last trip to the city, La Reve was too obscure and too hard to pronounce for most everyone, so developer Steve Wynn, the force behind Bellagio, Mirage, and Treasure Island, in a move hinting at both frustration with our plebeian ways and a Napoleonic ego, slapped his own name on the project and left it at that.   Steve Wynn is responsible for maybe my favorite juxtaposition of highbrow and lowbrow in the city -- the Wynn Collection. The museum, on the site of the former Desert Inn, features a dozen or so works by the likes of Picasso[2], Gauguin, and Matisse. You'd know this, even if you weren't an art aficionado, because the jumbotronic LED sign out front, which looks like it wouldn't be at all out of place fronting a suburban strip mall, scrolls through a series of messages:  Works by Pablo Picasso (flash, flash) Paul Gauguin (flash, flash) Henri Matisse (flash, flash)   Here, on a giant tacky sign on a street resplendent with giant tacky signs, in a city resplendent with giant tacky signs that all ache to be giant tacky signs with Las Vegas Boulevard addresses, some of the most admired painters of the 20th Century are relegated to the same mode of advertising as $5.99 dinner specials and 'loose slots.' The sign would not look out of place at the aptly-named Terrible's Casino, as a matter of fact.  But the giant sign reminds you that it is, in fact, Steve Wynn's ragingly expensive art collection housed here, and even though the gallery exterior is slight on ambience, he does lord over works by some of the undisputed masters of 20th Century Art. And you're not likely to forget it. After all, Wynn Collection.  If you're in the mood for more aptly-curated, ragingly expensive art, you can wander over to the Venetian, walk under its very pink, very garish, very frescoed and not-quite-authentic-looking ceilings, and go to the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, which boasts collections that wouldn't at all be out of place at the Whitney or MOMA. And then, in the spirit of having it all, you can walk for three minutes and plop down at a Wheel of Fortune slot machine, letting the lights and the hysteria and the promise of a magic, jingly pull suck you in.   --  It wasn’t always like this, of course. Las Vegas was connected to railway by 1905, and what became known as Glitter Gulch, the downtown enclave of casinos now firmly entrenched as the Strip’s tacky, embarrassing older brother, sprang up in the following decades. The hotel-casino concept started in Las Vegas with the Rancho El Vegas in 1940. The Flamingo, the first of the Strip hotels still around today, opened in 1946. The Riviera was the first of the Strip high-rises, built in 1955. Before that, the relatively squat Desert Inn, with a third-floor “skyroom,” was considered the place to go for a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding valley. The Rancho El Vegas began booking stars in 1941 to begin entertaining guests, and topless showgirls made their debut in 1957. A century earlier, Mormons settled in the area, later abandoning their modest adobe homes due to Indian raids. There’s still a sizable Mormon population in Las Vegas, even though there may be no worse place on Earth to be Mormon. [3]  When I announced to acquaintances living in Vegas that I was writing an essay about Vegas as the ultimate American city, even though I was doing so online, I could see the dramatic eye rolling and hear the expelled sighs that accompanied their online responses. The message could be summed up to say, 'Here we go again,' and indeed, they want to point out something that was clearly evident from driving off the Strip and into its residential clusters -- Vegas is not a 24/7 party for most of its residents.  There are not showgirls hanging out on every corner waiting to do a lavish musical number when the light changes from red to green. They wanted to make clear that Vegas is full of normal people having normal lives, in the same way that people from Dallas want to clarify that not everyone in Dallas wears a cowboy hat and lives on a ranch, in much the same way that people from Detroit want to point out that not everyone in Detroit lives in crumbling tenements and get around by stealing other peoples' cars.  Indeed, if you drive east of the Strip, past the airport, for about 10 or 15 minutes, you pass Henderson and then go into the heart of Green Valley, a 13,000-acre master planned community that is as lush and green and SUV-compatible as any other upscale suburban enclave you can picture in your part of the country.  Its primarily tourist attraction is the Ethel M. Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, which is exactly as advertised. You can tour the chocolate factory in a brisk ten-minute walk, browse in the gift shop (where the tour ends up, naturally), and then stroll outside to the cactus garden on the grounds, which allows you to learn more about indigenous desert plants than you ever thought possible with a box of chocolate tucked under your arm.  Green Valley, perhaps more than anything else in Vegas, hints at a normalcy along the lines of, say, a suburb in Phoenix, which might be as staidly normal as America gets. But this being Vegas, the normalcy feels worn more than owned -- an Epcot version of normal, a normal that looks as thematic and carefully contrived as anything on the Strip.  There are, after all, slot machines in the grocery stores in Vegas, newspaper vending machines full of escort services publications lining arterials well off the Strip, and fanciful backdrops of the Strip skyline behind the anchors delivering the local news. Many of Vegas's residents want to be thought of as normal people living in a normal city, but there's only so much of a case you can make for it before you say, 'Yeah, but' and demand a local takes you to see Wayne Newton's house. Though some might refuse, others will invariably oblige, a little proud that they can lay claim to something that, while kitschy, is actually oddly iconic. [4]  Incidentally, the Wayne Newton house, which is really an estate called Shenandoah, is on that drive between the Strip and Green Valley at the corner of Sunset Road, a major east-west arterial connecting the Strip and the freeway to the eastern reaches of the Vegas Valley, and Pecos Road.   Shenandoah is in that uniquely conflicted realm between tasteful and tasteless that seems to be quintessentially Vegas and not really anything else. It wants to invoke the majesty of a Kentucky thoroughbred ranch, and at the same time, it wants its gilded golden gates and its placard-bearing public art.  To give you some indication of the sort of world we're in, Mike Tyson's house is about a block down Pecos, and it's infinitely more tasteful, the sort of house that gives me house envy (and my tastes run toward the clean and uncomplicated, just so you know). The only thing that even began to reveal the eccentricities of the owner inside was the rows of portable outdoor heaters along the walkways, strategically placed so Tyson could theoretically walk around the grounds of his house without experiencing a moment of cold; I can't say that's a particularly bad thing at all.   And we're not even in Vegas here -- we're in Henderson, where Vegas tries hardest to assert its normalcy, its just-like-youness, its anonymity. And yet, in this unassuming part of the metropolis, an instantly recognizable pop icon could call out 'Hi, neighbor' and wave to one of the most notorious public figures of the last quarter-century, and then go back into his walled estate in preparation for another night of entertaining tourists from all over the world in a theater that bears his name.   With me, at least, the 'we're just like you' argument isn't flying.   --  In a city where most of the tourist activity focuses on a single street, it's not surprising that so many of the Strip hotels want to control the vertical as well as the horizontal. The Bellagio has an elaborate series of motorized fountains in its massive pool fronting the Strip sidewalk. Every fifteen minutes, the Bellagio puts the fountains to work in a show marrying a song (could be Sinatra, could be Celine Dion, could be the National Anthem, could be anything emblematic and in broad brushstrokes really) with a synchronized dance of water jets. From across the street, at the Paris, one can see the show from the outdoor café terraces or from the air in the half-scale Eiffel Tower model.  The Stratosphere Tower, at 1,149 feet, is the tallest observation tower in the United States. Because it wouldn't be enough to have the tallest building in Vegas, the observation deck, at over 900 feet, boasts a roller coaster, a ride called the X Scream which basically dangles its riders over the side of the tower and then -- perversely -- stops there to let you peer at a potential death-by-falling, It also features a ride called the Big Shot which takes you 160 feet above the observation deck at a force of 4 Gs. It would seem that sadists got together to decide what attractions would be placed at the Stratosphere, though you can already see that someone in some marketing Gulag assigned to promote these rides would refer to fans of this sort of thing as 'ultimate thrill-seekers.'   And finally, the winner of the Sky Sweepstakes may be the Luxor -- built as a giant pyramid with a replica of the Sphinx of Gaza out front -- which projects a toxically-bright beam of light from its top triangular windows to the heavens once night falls. I'm no physics major, so I have no idea if there's a point where the light just dissipates to nothingness. I assume it does. Maybe it does go to infinity. I feel I should know this, and I feel like a failure for not being able to conclusively state where the Luxor's light stops. All that really matters from a Vegas standpoint, though, is it reaches higher than anything else on the Strip, and if you're out on the eastern edges of town, past the airport, toward the fringes of Ostensibly Just Like You-land, you can see it. It sure as hell reaches higher than the Stratosphere Tower does.   --  The hotels themselves, from personal experience and reports from other friends, shape up this way: opulent, grandiose lobbies that give way to hotel rooms with sumptuous bathtubs and views resplendent with neon streaking. Which sounds good, except Vegas hotels also tend toward bed-pillow ensembles that don't so much beckon you to sleep a languid sleep as they do forcibly recharge you for another day of gambling. They also fuel you in the form of in-house restaurants that carboload you to absurd levels of satiation for considerable prices. Cheap buffets can be found if you look hard enough, though it's clearly in the spirit of getting what you pay for.   Your idea of romance has to encompass an ability to laugh at kitsch together; fortunately, this works out quite well for my wife and me. But Vegas, at some point in the proceedings, would really rather have you peel off from one another, perch you side by side at slot machines, and let you have at it. After all, Vegas is not built on letting you hole up in a hotel room that can be had for as little as $79 a night.  There's also shopping to be had, with the two best examples being the Forum at Caesars Palace and the Grand Canal Shoppes (sic) in the Venetian Hotel.  The Forum, though it has a wide assortment of stores housed under a fake Roman setting complete with columns and a vast, ice-blue sky filled with puffy cumulus clouds, doesn't necessarily have to be walked through to get the full effect -- you can do that just as well by watching what might be the consummate Vegas movie,  Showgirls . There's a critical scene in which Elizabeth Berkley's Nomi Malone character bonds with Gina Gershon's Cristal Connors character while enjoying a ridiculously indulgent lunch at a 'patio' table on the Forum walkway, contrasting their good fortune with the particular brand of dog food they both favored in considerably leaner times, to make the rags-to-riches nature of their story just that much more blatant.   The movie casts Vegas as a sort of purgatory, and at the end of the movie, when Nomi leaves Vegas behind after committing a horrible-but-justified (in this setting, at least) crime, hitching a ride to Los Angeles, L.A. becomes cast as heaven. No, scratch that. Vegas is cast as sort of a reverse purgatory, where, once you've adequately blackened your soul, you are expelled into the bowels of hell -- here, Los Angeles in all its plastic, money-grubbing horror. The subtle undercurrent message of the movie (if such a thing can be said for the movie that put Joe Eszterhas on the map) is that Vegas is able to tart up the grit enough to keep it from being a Boschian landscape of soot-encrusted hard luck stories. The Forum at Caesars Palace is one of these freshly-painted tableaus hoisted up to hide the treachery and inevitable fall from grace that L.A. is notorious for. But then again, I'm not a big L.A. fan.  The Grand Canal Shoppes, on the other hand, demand to be walked through -- or better yet, demand to be journeyed through in a gondola steered by some minimum-wage lackey in a festive striped shirt, to get the full effect. Yet there is one on-screen moment that allows one to get the sense of the onslaught that is the GCS without actually setting foot (or splashing down) inside it.   Through some odd coincidence in which televisual life synchs up with your lived life, my wife and I saw the Regis Galerie segment of the Michael Jackson BBC special only several hours after walking though the real Regis Galerie ourselves. If you recall, there's a scene in which Jackson takes now-notorious documentarian Martin Bashir through Regis Galerie. Jackson proclaims the store, located in the Grand Canal Shoppes, as his favorite place to shop.   Regis Galerie specializes in Hideous and Overpriced Art -- a lot of bronze, a lot of splashy paintings -- the type of place where they don't mind throwing around terms like 'giclees.' You do not want to break anything in this store, and unless you tend toward the gem-encrusted or the ornate, you probably do not want to buy anything in this store. It's like Versailles without the necessary spacing -- everything is clumped together in rows, with aisles far too narrow to be reasonably sure you won't catch your foot on the corner of something that will cost you $10,000 in a dangerous game of You Break, You Buy.   You can see why Michael Jackson would like a place like this. Remember, this is a man who tends toward sequins and gold trim and get-ups that make him look like a general in the Army of Oz. Even with his current legal troubles, he still strikes me as the celebrity most likely to wear a crown in public. So I can't imagine why he wouldn't find Regis Galerie attractive.   Is it too reductive to reduce the entire shopping complex into what might arguably be its most narrowly specialized store? Perhaps. Yet when it comes to crystallizing the horrors of more-money-than-taste that can be had at the GCS, I keep flashing back to that scene in the Bashir movie, brilliant in its ability to catch Michael Jackson in a swoon over art that, despite its hundreds of hours to make and thousands of dollars to buy, would set any good normal American, even those who make the pilgrimage to Vegas to nibble from Eve's apple, into icy recoil.  --   Of course, there's a whole other route to excess in Vegas that doesn't require a continual hemorrhaging of money, but rather, one hefty payment upfront, and that's the Vegas show. The stage shows, as you might expect, are elaborate affairs that try to dazzle and overwhelm. Any attempt to connect on an earnest level seem doomed for failure, though Rita Rudner has carved out a niche for herself at New York New York that I imagine few could have predicted. Celine Dion, on the other hand, was probably on a trajectory for her own Vegas show from the time her emotive-yet-manly flexing moves entered her onstage repertoire.   With Siegfried and Roy on permanent hiatus, an impressionist/singer named Danny Gans (who shared face time with S&R in Mirage's full-court-press billboard campaign) is now ruling the Mirage [5], and the Amazing Jonathan, who appears to be a rougher, more plebian version of Gans, features at the Flamingo. You can, reductively, still group most of the Vegas show set into three categories: B and C-List Stars In Freefall, Multi-Taskers You've Never Heard Of, and Elaborate Stage Shows With Complete Unknowns (Featuring Breasts). But then you have to also figure in Cirque de Soleil, and that has completely changed the landscape of Strip hotel entertainment, thank God.   Currently, Cirque de Soleil is ruling the roost in Vegas, show-wise, and that's really not a bad thing. There are three official CdS shows currently running --  Mystere , at Treasure Island, which appears to be the most run-of-the-mill of the three;  Zumanity , at New York New York, which is adult and racy and apparently so pointedly ribald that Paris Hilton walked out on it, according to Local Tour Guide after one of the troupe members pointed to her table and said, 'Here's where all the prostitutes sit;' and  O , at the Bellagio, which is of such a startling scale that it probably merits an essay all to itself.  Cirque de Soleil does not translate to TV, although the Bravo cable channel certainly tries by airing CdS specials whenever it's not airing  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . This is especially true of  O , a show involving 81 performers, a deluxe theater at the Bellagio with a 1.5 million gallon tank of water with moving sections of floor, constantly shifting from pool to stage to stage with sections of pool. The whole show is stunning, and given that our tickets were $150 each (when my wife and I went), it's a good thing that it is so stunning. Even the opening unfurling of the curtain is orchestrated to be stunning. There are some vague themes and emotional tones in the piece, but if you broke it down and analyzed it, I think you would only make yourself sick, so really you should just watch it and enjoy it for the eye candy it is. And at the risk of sounding like a bourgeois consumer that can't quite make it to highbrow, you need to see this show when you're in Vegas -- yes, you, dear reader -- than for no other reason but to have this remain at one end of your theater spectrum. For the other, you should see a single actor perform Wallace Shawn's  The Fever . Those are probably the most extreme theater poles you could seek out. [6]  Of course, you don't have to spend a Benjamin or more to see Vegas at its most over-the-topability. If you're going to see one schlocky, free piece-of-crap production, I heartily suggest  The Sirens of TI , an elaborate 20-minute stage show designed for public consumption (sort of) which also doubled as the opening PR gambit in Treasure Island's transformation into TI.  Back when Treasure Island was Treasure Island, they'd do a show out in front of the hotel where the pirate ship sinks the British ship. The show was predictably thematic, full of yo-ho-hoing and appropriately festooned with skull-and-crossbone flags and eyepatches. Treasure Island is now -- avast! -- trying to remake itself into something younger and sultrier, in order to compete with the other hotels. Ergo, TI. But unfortunately for them, the TI logo has arrived on its giant light-up sign out front looking vaguely like the opening card on a children's video, and the calling card for TI has turned into a show that strives to be, above all else, babelicious.   There's still a pirate ship in  The Sirens of TI , but it's placed in more of an adversarial role. Indeed, the show is essentially a chance to get away with as many clumsy sexual allusions as possible and sink a boat in the process. We start with voice over announcing that it's the 69th day at sea for the pirates (see, not subtle), and a cabin boy alights upon the deck of the Sirens' boat. The Sirens establish themselves early on, through dancing and costumes in the opening number, for lack of a better term, as hotties.  They establish their characters, and the character of the show, early on. The leader of the Sirens, Cinnamon, asserts that you can call her 'Cin' (wink, nudge), and makes it a point to inform the audience about all the 'seamen' she's brought into her 'cove.' (I wish I were kidding.)  It goes on from there to feature babe dancing, the emergence of the pirate ship, babe boasting, babe dancing, some pyrotechnics, the sinking of the pirate boat, and pirates boarding the deck of the siren boat for pornographic cavorting about. The music's horrible, too -- a collision of rock and schlock, truly outrageous in the cartoonish way that Jem (obscure '80s reference) was truly, truly outrageous.    It's as if the producers said, 'Okay, here's a concept: let's make a show that's reeaaaally bad ... but we'll say it's good!' Clearly, though, there's something great about the show, if I can give you a cursory 'Go see  O ' without describing a single scene, and yet painstakingly break down the  Sirens  show plot point by plot point. What's great about  Sirens  is this: people stay through the whole thing. Stunningly, some video tape it. As in record. The whole thing. I joked to my wife, in the post-show, shaking-our-heads analysis, that if I was recording it, I'd be a few minutes into it and go, 'Ohhh, okay ... never mind,' and pull the camera down.  But not these people. They were  dutifully  filming the whole thing. You would think that's nothing special, since, you know, Vegas, tourist, videocameras. Yet this phenomenon is rarer than you'd think in Vegas. I didn't see a lot of the compulsive videotaping people you'd expect at other tourist destinations.  I'm guessing that, other than the fact that a spinning slot machine doesn't translate well to the small screen, especially if it's spinning for several hours at a stretch, it's because people are indulging in behaviors they might not want recorded. The new motto for Vegas (this is the official motto, mind you, from their CVB) is 'What Happens Here, Stays Here.' By that line of reasoning, if you record it, it goes with you.  And I think, really, Vegas resists recording. It has to be experiential. You can't adequately film the adrenaline roller coaster that accompanies slot machine reverie or blackjack gaming or the tense, sinister-looking game called Pai Gow Poker, which involves some cryptic mix of cards and dominos, played by some of the most focused people in the casino, who also happen to be the people who look most like bit players in Bond movies.  And I'm pretty sure you can't just take a video camera into one of the many strip clubs in Vegas, speaking of what happens here stays here. Someone was telling me there's something like 28 strip clubs in Vegas, and though I don't know it empirically, I'm willing to guess that there's a whole other archetype in Vegas -- namely, the archetype that sports radio talk show host Jim Rome likes to call the This Stripper Really Likes Me Guy.  During my last stay in Las Vegas, there was a news story about a hearing involving Dennis Rodman, who got a DUI for wrecking a motorcycle in front of a strip club called Treasures. I saw enough billboards and alt-weeklies and heard enough sports talk radio during the trip to get a sense that the This Stripper Really Likes Me Guy is well taken care of in Vegas.   Again, it makes sense -- a sort of deductive reasoning sense -- in Vegas. In our society, sex is still largely in the realm of the forbidden, and strip clubs effectively make sex commerce, put a price tag on human contact, and in the relatively brief interchanges in which dancers and customers, meet, talk, carve out what appears to be a temporary, mutual semblance of love, and consummate the illusion via lapdance, the feeling like love becomes a commodity itself. And then, with relative tidiness, the dancer moves on to create similar connections with other customers, and the customer can walk out of the establishment and back to his life again, wearing the cloak of anonymity most of us wear.  (Or, if you're not anonymous, like Dennis Rodman is not, you can just wreck your motorcycle in front of the strip club and add to your already inflated and even tired bad-boy lore with maximum effectiveness, for what in our culture says bad boy more than hangs out at strip clubs, sports tattoos, and rides a motorcycle?)   The strip club makes sense in Vegas, more so than it does in Oklahoma City or Indianapolis, or in my hometown of San Antonio, which has recently passed a new set of rules banning dancer-customer contact as part of a moralist campaign that has also placed new regulations on one of the other permissible evils of our day and age: smoking. San Antonio isn't alone in setting up special rules around strip clubs, and in any other American city but Vegas, rules set up to regulate strip clubs is not a particularly shocking development.   But Vegas reasons that there's nothing wrong with it. In a world where everything is reduced to crass commerce, why not the courtship ritual and a grinding intimacy, too? I imagine, that if our technology ever produces a marketable, consumable virtual sex arcade, Vegas will become the place to test drive it. Like the indoor skydiving room just off the Strip, like the jousting tournaments at Excalibur, like the close encounters with Klingons at the Hilton's  Star Trek: The Experience , Vegas wants to take what might reside in the more fantasy-laden realms of your imagination and vivify them into glaring Technicolor reality. Not even decorum need be an obstacle, the 28 gentlemen's establishments of Vegas seem to tell you in one throaty voice, as long as you create a culture of permission. After all, as even the CVB tells you, what happens here, stays here.  --  But Vegas is not just a magnet for degenerates looking to escape their lives, to exchange their gritty existences for elaborate fantasies. I would say that a majority of the millions of tourists who come through each year are here to, mechanically and with purpose, play games of chance in the hopes of making money. And so, we can't really talk about Vegas without mentioning the Octogenerian Slot Machine Players.  They're an archetype unto themselves, and as with other Vegas archetypes, they only become archetypical in the rarefied air of Vegas. In their normal, day-to-day lives, they're pleasant, retired people, many of them fussing over grandchildren and living humble but comfortable lives on savings accumulated through years of hard work, aided by buying into a real estate market more conducive to creating a nest egg and building for one's future than today's double-income, debt-happy economy. My septuagenarian in-laws are perhaps the prototype for this brand of Vegas tourist. [7]  Several times a year, something stirs within the souls of the OSMPs, they make the pilgrimage to Vegas, collect a bucket with quarters (or, for the ultra-spendthrifty, nickels), find a favorable machine, and pull away. Some slot machines don't even have levers anymore -- you just push a button and watch yourself lose money/win money/break even, for hours at a stretch. Some smoke. Some drink. All achieve a glassy reverie at some point in the proceedings. Eventually, they return home, doing helpful things on the plane ride home like waking up Your Correspondent to see if he wants anything from the stewardess, even though he's clearly asleep, even though there's nothing in his slumping, snoring figure to suggest he thirsts.   Whereas there's a certain level of intimidation to the games of chance controlled by a hotel employee -- perhaps reminiscent of hollow-eyed carneys who preside over carnival midway games you know are stacked against you -- there's something about the rows of slot machines that are inviting by contrast. By telling someone to deal you in, or that you want to put a chip down on your lucky number in roulette, or that you want a turn at the dice, you're having to admit to another person (no matter how professional a countenance or no matter how neutral an expression that person is able to maintain) that you gamble.   Though your inner devil might say, 'Of course you do, you're in Vegas, that's what you're here for,' your inner angel might feed you full of Puritan messages about the evils of gambling. Vocalizing your desire to gamble to another human being, even one in the employ of a casino, might be enough to push that debate front and center.   But slot machines don't talk. They don't have to fight to maintain a poker face whenever you do something brilliant or do something stupid at one of the tables. They don't remind you of your pastor back home. They just sit there, rows and rows of them, with the latent promise that one of them is going to deliver.  Despite being set to randomly deliver jackpots at unpredictable intervals, OSMPs like my mother-in-law will claim there's a system to playing the slots. My father-in-law goes as far as to talk about how playing the slots successfully is 'a lot of work.' I tend to believe him, and because he's the type of man who will look forward to his home improvement projects and stretch them out over multiple days, puttering and fussing under the guise of 'getting things just right' in order to make them last and even savor them, I think that he probably actually enjoys the 'hard work' of playing slots.   So they work. They scout out machines that have been recently abandoned by players who spent interminable amounts of time pulling or pushing with no results. They themselves sit for hours, mechanically feeding coins into the face of the machine, hoping for the release of coins that you would hope could fend off orgasm metaphors yet really can't, especially when you see a jackpot winner's reaction, an outpouring of joy that derails a personal sense of modesty en route to unfiltered bliss.   Of course, it's not all work -- as I said earlier, some drink, which is a simple way of saying that gambling and drinking are helplessly intertwined. That's another reason I believe slot machines are so popular -- it dawns on you at some point in the proceedings at the blackjack table or the poker table or even the roulette wheel that alcohol may cloud your judgment and cause you to lose more money that you would while sober. But in front of the slot machine, you're not losing more money with every pull so much as you're investing the time necessary to work the law of averages to your advantage and win that money back. And then some.   Clearly, though, the mission of Vegas is to get you to drink while gambling -- hence, the scantily-clad cocktail waitress, who in most of the hotels look decidedly like a paean to a dying age: the Playboy Club Epoch. Though seemingly engineered to salve the various hurts of middle-aged men, the costumes, I think that maybe, perversely, the Greatest Generation set, now spending their golden years on Vegas vacations, might be the real target of the scantily-clad cocktail waitress outfit.  You see, the outfit is evoking the nostalgia of a bygone era, and by wearing the outfit as rendered during the time where today's septuagenarians and octogenarians were first middle-aged men in need of spiritual/sexual balm, it's reflecting that reassuring reminder of 'the way things used to be, back when they were good.' Note, though, that is still has the same effect on a certain percentage of today's middle-agers. For today's hipper, snottier generations, it has a different appeal, predicated on the same kind of anti-cool cool that explains a predilection toward trucker caps and Pabst Blue Ribbon.   In any case, it's not so much what the cocktail waitress is or isn't wearing, but rather, what they're parading around on their trays.   Alcohol is pretty much inescapable in Vegas. Though it's not quite a situation where you're handed a drink as you get off the plane [8], drinks can be had pretty much anywhere you please. On our recent trip, we went up to the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris, a half-scale model of the real thing that allowed you to, among other sightseeing endeavors, see the Bellagio fountain show from overhead. One fellow tourist glibly noted, to whoever would hear him, that this was the only place in Vegas without a bar attached to it. In other words, pretty much everyone notices there's a lot to drink.  This brings me to another of my favorite Vegas archetypes, the I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy, who is either carrying a can of crappy domestic beer from a second-rate hotel for $1 or is carrying a large drink in a tall souvenir receptacle. [9] I saw at least three plastic Eiffel Towers being consumed on my walks up and down the Strip, and saw none in my two nights inside the Paris. Why not? The only reasonable explanation is that I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy migrates. Any chump can drink from a sitting position -- it takes the professional acumen of I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy to drink while walking. Besides, it's no fun to advertise that you've actually been inside the Paris while sitting in the middle of the Paris. It's better to let the throngs gathered on LVB know where you've stayed. [10]  The funny thing is, you don't have to have that level of professional drinking acumen to pick up your drink and walk. The latent permissiveness of Vegas allows unsuspecting candidates to walk around brandishing a drink like a trophy. It's a way of saying to the world, 'I work hard and fit in the vast majority of my life; I've earned this moment of unbridled hedonism.' And, in our world, by safe and conservative middle-American rules, this is just the kind of thing that passes for unbridled hedonism. We're perfectly willing to let this slide under these circumstances. We even welcome it. None of us have probably ever witnessed the amiable drunk at a party actually don a lampshade and start dancing, but if one did, we would recognize the trope, and we would laugh about it (provided, of course, that we took his keys and called him a cab at the end of the night).  What the Vegas pilgrims have done, essentially, is made this former little desert outpost a place to absorb and hold an ever-increasing number of mildly transgressive behaviors. It's no accident, for instance, that the Las Vegas season of MTV's seminal reality show  The Real World  was a running soap opera of sex, bad choices and aberrant behavior, all set against the tableau of the Palms, an off-Strip casino which has become the home base of choice for twentysomething enfants terribles.  Forget, for a moment, that the show was later surpassed in sex and sordidness by the cast of  Real World San Diego  -- they merely had to answer the call put forth by the Vegas cast. [11] And it was Vegas itself that incited the cast to riot, to such ludicrous extremes that Trishelle Cannatella, the central figure of the RW Vegas season, became something of a professional reality show cast member, later assigned to drink on camera and titillate fellow cast member Ron Jeremy on the WB's aptly-named  Surreal Life . Trishelle, as you might expect, morphed into such a quasi-celebrity that she never donned her last name for her subsequent reality show appearances. She became a mononym, a sure sign as any of disposable pop icon status.   --  Though  Real World Las Vegas  is a prime indication of how Vegas is trying to market to a new generation of people with a healthy disposable income, the Vegas metro area is no longer merely a nice place to visit.  Between 1990 and 2000, the largest metro area growth in the nation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was easily Las Vegas. Its population spiked an incredible 83% percent in that ten-year period; the next biggest jump was Naples, Florida, with 65%, and Yuma, Ariz., at just under 50%. This is not just a one-time spike. Since 1960, Vegas has grown from just under 140,000 people to its current 1.5 million plus, at astounding growth intervals. The population more than doubled in the 1960s and has been above 60% growth in each subsequent decade.   And the people just keep coming. The city's official site claims that the Vegas Valley could reach the two million mark by next year. Last month, the  Las Vegas Sun  reported that another million people are expected to be added to the city's rolls in the next two decades. The article glosses over why this growth is continuing, instead focusing on some of the concerns a massive growth explosion brings to the metropolis, such as the hard-to-overlook fact that Las Vegas sits in the middle of a desert, and that might make water a contentious issue as more people flock to the city to take advantage of what gets euphemized as 'favorable business conditions.'   What I can surmise, after trolling business development agency websites and various newspaper articles, is that Vegas is a great place to do business because the burden of taxation in Clark County falls largely on the millions of tourists who come through McCarran each year. The weather is nice. You're never at a loss for how to entertain your clients, and though you may grow weary of it, and mutter to yourself, 'Yeah, yeah, Wayne Newton's house' as you drive first-timers past Shenandoah yet again, there's always someone who's going to be wide-eyed and appreciative, who will actually be impressed that he Lives Among Us, that you are so seemingly well-connected.   At the risk of being reductive yet again, businessmen like sun, they like golf, and they like being able to get a drink after work. Ergo, Las Vegas. And while the tourism industry remains the major engine driving Clark County (and by extension, Nevada, since Clark Country makes up a good 70 percent of the state population), there are people living in Vegas that have nothing to do, occupation-wise, with the hotels and the hordes of tourist who come to Vegas each year seeking several days' escape from the rules that normally corral them into stagnant routine.   And you can tell that even at sunrise: a desert sunrise in the first week of Advent in the Christian calendar, where the air is tingly with cold -- where it is crisp, invigorating, all those things you say about a cold that you welcome, a cold you want to believe was delivered to your vacation destination expressly for your enjoyment. You can look around and notice subtle hints of Christmas if you try, but it's different from other cities, where the march toward Christmas is relentless, where wreaths and ads and glad tidings come in battalions.  At sunrise, in the outer reaches of North Las Vegas, of Henderson, of picture-perfect Green Valley, in the parts of Vegas that don't look like our postcard-ready images of Vegas, it's showers and cereal as part of this complete, nutritious breakfast and commutes to work. But on the Strip, where the nerve endings of Vegas crackle and sing, there's a temporary stillness that seems unnervingly quiet and disarmingly out-of-character. The jingling and whirring in the hotel lobby casinos is at an off-kilter staccato, and hotel employees see it fit to break out vacuum cleaners and bottles of cleaning solutions.   In hours, these places will be readily transformed again, with people from Iowa, from Massachusetts, from Europe and Japan. Throughout the lobby, in enough myriad languages to remind you that this is now, for all intents and purposes, an international city, it will essentially be the same message. It will be tourists, the lifeblood of the city with all that that entails, here for the express purpose of shedding their inhibitions for a few precious days, trying to figure out which compulsory layer they'd like to peel off first.   ###  Footnotes:   [1] The closest thing to a major professional sports team in Vegas is the Las Vegas 51s, a Triple-A baseball franchise which used to have the more mundane moniker of the Las Vegas Stars. The 51s is a play on Area 51, the rumored military-controlled alien research center. The team's mascot is one of those almond-headed, big-eyed alien prototypes, which, in a shocking development for new parents, is precisely what your child looks like through the ultrasound at three months -- pretty much the first time you can actually view what looks like a face.   [2] Wynn owns a Picasso piece named 'La Reve,' incidentally.   [3] The above historical information comes from Las Vegas Online Entertainment Guide's history page, which delves much farther into the role of the casino and the Strip hotel in Vegas's development than the city's official site does, although the city's official site does note that Spainards traveling through the Vegas valley in the 1700s referred to the trip as a 'journey of death,' which can't be good for tourism even if it is historically accurate.  [4] Like my tour guide for the trip, a food stylist who hosts a nationally-syndicated radio show, moonlights as a UNLV instructor, and is clearly in a gustatory, golf-playing love with Vegas.  [5] That's not to suggest that Gans was in cahoots with that white tiger or anything.   [6] Okay, so maybe  now  I look highbrow.  [7] Though, actually, they can stave off the siren song of Vegas by going on a lower-rent version of the Vegas pilgrimage -- the Louisiana pilgrimage. Louisiana, which is also a den of sin, features casinos in a number of the towns (Lake Charles, Kinder, Bossier City) bordering Texas. Native American-run casinos, even closer than the Louisiana border, also serve as a sort of morphine to the heroin of Vegas. But, somehow, Vegas always beckons.   [8] A la the '70s ABC drama  Fantasy Island , which used the 'give the guests their Mai Tais' scene as a regular device, showing them happy and relaxed just before they started their fantasy vacations, which (like a Faustian bargain) had specific intents and aims that would always go horribly awry.  [9] Though you're actually more likely to see I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy in New Orleans. Or, at least, you'll see him there more exuberantly.   [10] And, really, when all is said and done, and you factor in the breakfast buffet and the bathtubs and the relative calm in its casino, the Paris is a fine place to stay.   [11] No way do we let San Diego beat Las Vegas in anything.          "
"            When it opened in April 1994, the San Antonio baseball park now known as Nelson Wolff Stadium was called “the Jewel of the Texas League,” and Mickey Holt, Public Relations Director for the San Antonio Missions, still likes to call it that.  It’s a definite upgrade from the former home of the Missions, V. J. Keefe Memorial Stadium – an old, primarily wooden structure still in use by the St. Mary’s University Rattlers, which looks, sadly, on first impression, like sufficiently combustible kindling for a one-match fire. When compared to the newest parks in the league, including Round Rock’s immaculate Dell Diamond and the currently-under-construction Whataburger Field in Corpus Christi, Nelson Wolff Stadium looks as if it’s from another epoch, and in the development of the American sports stadium, coming just before Camden Yards in Baltimore revolutionized our present-day conceptions of what a baseball stadium should be, it pretty much is.   Holt calls it a pitcher’s park, noting that there’s an almost-constant 15 mph wind blowing in from right-center field. They’re not looking to replace it anytime soon, as it is still clean and serviceable and relatively new, but Holt notes that they’d really like to get a scoreboard with a video screen, when thinking about upgrades that are realistic and might inch them closer to Dell Diamond status, to replace the Alamo-shaped one in right field. Holt also think they should be drawing more than the 4400 a game they average, not only because San Antonio is the eighth largest city in the nation and boasts a healthy number of sports fans, but because the Missions are downright good, having won Texas League championships in 2002 and 2003. Certainly, it doesn’t escape you, if you attend a game in the 2004 season, that they’re back-to-back champions – the phrase is the core of their marketing campaign, appearing on the scoreboard, and on shirts, and on the jersey of their official mascot, an anthropomorphic jalapeno pepper with googly eyes named Ballapeno.   Riding out in the middle of the first inning on a motorized scooter, the Ballapeno indulges in the sort of fun, wacky mascot antics you’d expect of a mascot playing to 4400 a night who’ve come to watch Double A players with big league aspirations. He rides in the back of a truck around the perimeter of the field and shoots rolled-up T-shirts into the crowd as the truck loops its way past the infield seats. He dances on top of the dugout. He wanders into the crowd, pulls caps off children’s heads playfully, and slaps hands with adults who cannot resist the pull of a giant jalapeno pepper with googly eyes.   But at the end of the sixth inning, another, more mysterious mascot heads to second base, to the instant recognition and obvious delight of the crowd. This is the unofficial mascot, who has been with the team since a local restaurant sponsored him to come out to V. J. Keefe back in 1988 for a series of promotional appearances. Two years ago, Newsweek named him the minor league mascot of the year, even though Ballapeno has been the official Missions mascot since Opening Day of the 2000 Season, and one look at him is all it really takes to understand why.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you:  Henry the Puffy Taco.   The Puffy Taco very nearly defies conventional mascot wisdom. Typically, mascots are cartoonish depictions of people or animals or even objects, yet they wear distinctive human features like eyes and a mouth. It’s for the same reasons that babies and baby animals come into the world cute – to start the process of attachment, to allow the parents to want to care for it. Even the Corpus Christi Hooks, who will begin Texas League play in 2005, have started their marketing campaign by floating out a logo which appears to be a giant fishing hook with eyes and a mouth, and it wouldn’t at all be surprising if this gets committed to fabric and is set in motion to wander the stands next spring.   But the Puffy Taco doesn’t even try for recognizable facial features. It is, simply, gloriously, without pretense, a taco. More precisely, the costume is an open shell facing forward and standing on its end, covering the head and torso, with holes for the arms and legs to protrude from the shell. Because there’s no better way to describe this, vulva-like folds of lettuce and cheese protrude slightly from behind the open folds of the shell, all but enveloping the dark-red cylinder at the center of the taco, which is clearly where the actor’s head and torso fit, and which has to be meant to represent the meat at the center of the taco, although this would make the costume more of a hot-dog taco than a ground beef taco. “Henry the Puffy Taco” is stitched along the back of the taco shell at its bottom edge, for the four or five people in the audience on any given night who need clarification on who this is.  The Puffy Taco’s act is simple yet effective, and is a thirty-second case study in everything that is glorious yet low-rent about minor league baseball – that, indeed, is glorious precisely because it is so low-rent. The Puffy Taco starts at second base, and runs for home plate by way of third. A child is selected from the audience; it is his or her job to tackle the Puffy Taco before he reaches home. There’s a Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote certainty to the act; it always concludes with the child tackling the Taco, and the show has evolved to incorporate an additional moment of triumph in which the child is allowed to clamber on top of the Taco and lift his or her hands skyward to make the “raise the roof” gesture. I think you can probably figure out what the crowd does in response.  Then, the Taco gets up and does a dance, and circulates through the stands for another half-inning or so, slapping hands and greeting the kids who flock around him, before giving the stage over to the Ballapeno for the rest of the evening.   The Taco’s act has evolved on its own over time. Initially, there was no tackling – as Holt explains, the first tackle was actually an overzealous kid bumping into the Taco during a race. What was ordained from the beginning was that the kid was always supposed to win. Holt recalls that on the one occasion the Taco won the race, when the Taco’s act was still in its early stages of development, the crowd reacted with enough booing and general displeasure to assure that that wouldn’t ever be happening again. . Over time, the two concepts – kid always triumphs, kid triumphs by tackling the Taco before he reaches home plate – merged into what is now the standard nightly ritual.   As mascot theater goes, the Taco’s act is simple and slapstick and interactive and allows a child to emerge triumphant in a situation that is not quite man v. beast but is similar enough to evoke feelings of top-of-the-food-chain superiority and the resultant joy that comes with that. For San Antonians, there’s an additional level to why the victory over the Puffy Taco works as a gimmick, and that has a lot to do with the fact that people in San Antonio really like their food.   The current mayor of San Antonio, Ed Garza, who is still in his early thirties yet was reelected to a second term in 2003, has been moved by a series of Men’s Fitness polls perennially listing San Antonio as one of the fattest cities in the nation to push something called the Fit City Initiative. But there’s a larger, easier, more informal movement that Fit City is pushing against, which will probably emerge triumphant at the end of the day, and that’s the citywide drive to eat a lot of fattening food, often in public.  Every April, the city essentially shuts down for a 10-day conglomeration of festivals and parades called Fiesta. At the heart of the 100-plus Fiesta events are two major parades which draw as many as half a million spectators and are serviced by a staggering number of makeshift festival food stands. The Night in Old San Antonio event, which runs four days in the city’s La Villita and is another major Fiesta draw, allows its thousands upon thousands of annual attendees a chance to eat and drink with abandon. There’s music and dancing and street festival frivolity to be had here, but ask any attendee, and they’re more likely than not to tell you they are there for the variegated meats on a stick or the gorditas or the fresh handmade tortillas or the bratwurst or crepes or frog legs or potato skins or any number of other foods.  The night before the first Krispy Kreme franchise opened in San Antonio, a line began forming outside its doors; by morning, 500 people had gathered, having camped out all night for access to the first hot, sticky, rings of fried dough to roll off the assembly lines and into their waiting mouths.  And every year in late January, right before the annual San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, a loose coalition of organizers host a Friday morning Cowboy Breakfast. Even though it has moved from location to location in the last few years, the annual Cowboy Breakfast always draws in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 thousand, no matter what the conditions outside, to gather in the early morning hours for food that is, in a particularly important calling card to the people of San Antonio, free. The San Antonio Express-News article on the 2004 Cowboy Breakfast, with reporter Lisa Marie Gomez following in the well-worn path of previous reporters’ stories on the event, begins this way:    The drizzle, patchy fog and 49-degree weather at 5 a.m. Friday were quickly forgotten when the bands blared their tunes and hot coffee and food were served. The Cowboy Breakfast was in full swing at Crossroads of San Antonio mall two hours before the sun made its debut for the day, and traffic piled up as if it were the evening rush hour. Despite the morning darkness and the cool weather, families came out in droves. One family piled into a van, with children, cousins, and even grandparents. “We’re here for the free food,” Wicho Guerra said as he munched on a slice of white bread drowned in gravy. “I have no idea what I’m eating, but it’s good.”   So it is clear that the Fit City Initiative has a way to go. Tourism, after all, is one of the city’s largest industries, and food is at the backbone of San Antonio’s allure for locals and visitors alike.   The Puffy Taco mascot gets its name from a Tex-Mex innovation that has been adopted by a number of the city’s vast array of Mexican restaurants. Specifically, it was Jamie Lopez, the son of the Henry’s Puffy Tacos owner, who came up with the idea for the Puffy Taco mascot in 1988 as a way to further associate the puffy taco dish with his dad’s restaurant. Henry’s Puffy Tacos, a Westside restaurant which opened in 1978 and relocated to a former Luby’s cafeteria around the corner in 1996, naturally lays claim to its title dish despite having many other offerings on the menu.   The puffy taco is a crispy taco with a shell that puffs up in the deep-frying process, filled to bursting with meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. A Citysearch review of Henry’s noted, “The shell of Henry’s signature dish is what newly fallen snow would feel like in your mouth – if it was fried.”   If you’re wise, and if you’re throwing caloric caution to the wind as you should be when you order the puffy taco, you’ll want to top it with sour cream and guacamole and salsa. Eating it is a messy affair, and is not so much a meal as it is a mainlining of fatty, spicy goodness. It’s a safe bet that Wicho Guerra and his clan have sprung for a dinner here at some point in their gastronomical journeys. And though they may not know exactly what they’re eating when they plunge into their puffy tacos, it’s safe to say they will determine it is, indeed, good.  But because Henry’s is far from the well-trafficked tourist haunts of the city, on a major arterial that cuts through a working-class, predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood, the Puffy Taco is a bit of a mystery to those tourists who find themselves taking in a Missions game at Nelson Wolff. A writer for minorleagueballparks.com, writing a review of the stadium in 1999, wrote, “I didn’t like the fact that the ‘Puffy Taco’ mascot was actually an advertisement for a fast-food chain,” and a scribe for ballparkreviews.com expressed disappointment that the Puffy Taco only makes his one appearance, despite “hearing much hype” about him.  Wesley Ratliff understands the tradition, though. At just 24 years old, Ratliff is the community outreach director for the Missions, which is an official way of saying that he is a professional mascot. He pulls double duty during each Missions home game, portraying both the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno, which is why they rarely appear in the same place at the same time.   Ratliff personifies the duality of San Antonio’s version of Generation Y perfectly – he sports a goatee and a tongue piercing that suggests a straight-from-MTV mainstream edginess, yet he’s unfailingly polite, responding to a number of questions from my interview with him with a demure and polite, “Yes, sir.”   Ratliff already has a long, impressive resume as a mascot. He started out as Eloc, the cougar mascot for Cole Junior/Senior High School, located on the Fort Sam Houston U.S. Army base, and best known as the alma mater of Shaquille O’Neal. Ratliff then moved on to serve as a mascot for the University of the Incarnate Word, one of San Antonio’s four-year Catholic universities, wearing one of the nation’s first inflatable costumes. He later moved on to professional mascothood at two of San Antonio’s prime theme parks, Sea World and Six Flags Fiesta Texas, and realized a lifelong dream of performing at Walt Disney World, taking a whirlwind tour in which he was allowed to portray Tigger, Eeyore, Gepetto, Tweedledee, Tweedledum, and Miss Piggy over the course of several weeks.  His new lifelong dream, fed by his two full-time years and six part-time years with the Missions, is to make it into the big league mascot ranks; last year, he was in the running to take over as Raymond, the mascot for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, which he describes somewhat perplexedly as “a sort of hairy troll thing.” He was one of two final candidates, and was ultimately the odd man out, but it’s clear that missing out on the chance to depict a hairy troll for one of MLB’s most moribund franchises might be a blessing in disguise. Ratliff graciously opines that it was an honor just to be in the running.  He’s also suffered for his art, having two surgeries on his knee for a torn meniscus – the first was the result of being tackled while portraying the Taco, the second came after a car accident aggravated the fragile ligament. The first actor playing the Puffy Taco also suffered a similar knee injury, leading one to believe that what a fifty-pound-child lacks in mass and force in tackling the Taco, he or she more than makes up for it in questionable technique, and is perhaps the prime Occupational Hazard for those with the calling to be a mascot.  Ratliff, despite the trick knee, is fortunate in that he is able to carve out a living as a professional mascot – a number of his colleagues on the Texas League circuit are actually salespeople within their respective organizations, moonlighting as the mascot in the sort of double-duty that isn’t at all surprising given the limited budgets on many minor-league teams.  And unlike a number of the other minor-league mascots toiling away in obscurity, Ratliff has at least enjoyed a fleeting yet memorable taste of the bigs. Last year, for fan appreciation day for the Mission’s parent organization, the Seattle Mariners, Ratliff was invited to Safeco Field where he performed as both the Ballapeno and Puffy Taco alongside the Moose, the Mariners’ lovable yet improbable mascot, the one enduring remnant from the team’s former owner Jeff Smulyan of Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications – a chapter of Seattle baseball history that many Mariners fans would just as soon forget.   Ratliff recalls his reception as nothing short of rock star. As the Taco, he accompanied the Moose for a G-rated version of running the gauntlet – being doused with water by Mariners players in a ritualized procession across the field. He reports that the crowd responded instantly when he came out, and later, he signed autographs for a crowd of fans waiting as long as 45 minutes in line to meet him.  He also learned, on this trip, that he has it pretty good in the minor leagues. Mascots in the majors are bound by a longer list of rules than he’s bound by. The Colorado Rockies mascot, also on hand at Safeco for Fan Appreciation Day is bound to stricter rules than the Moose – or, for that matter, Ratliff himself. The Rockies’ mascot can’t be on the field after the ceremonial first pitch, and can’t be on the dugout ever. Ratliff, by contrast, pretty much has license to go whenever he wants wherever he wants, allowed to read the crowd and create his moments as he pleases.  For all the love the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno receive, San Antonio’s heart belongs to another mascot, basically because its heart belongs to another team.   Despite the century-plus history of minor league baseball in San Antonio,  and despite having one of the most rabid high school football fan bases in football-obsessed Texas, San Antonio is a basketball town, and every other sport is thus relegated to being not-basketball. The Spurs have only been around since 1973, but because the team is the city’s highest-profile professional sports franchise, it enjoys a unique and revered position among San Antonians, and this extends to mascots, as none is more recognizable or more beloved than the Coyote.  Tim Derk, who debuted The Coyote in 1983, suffered a stroke this past March and has had to turn the job of playing the Coyote to understudies while he undergoes rehabilitation -- ending a 21-year run of donning a coyote mask with bulging bright green eyes and an easy-going, yet slightly maniacal, permanent grin.   The stroke not only sidelined Derk – it led him, his family, and the Spurs organization to do the unprecedented thing and reveal The Coyote’s identity to the public. For many, it was the first time they’d learned who Tim Derk was, and was also the first time they’d learned to separate Derk as someone distinct from The Coyote.   Derk’s condition was major news in San Antonio, dominating headlines and local newscasts for several days. The reaction showed that San Antonio, for all its aspirations to be a big city, is still a small town, in the good sense, at its core. Though we generally like our mascots anonymous in day-to-day life, and transformed into the lovable character when safely encased in the costume, there was no question of Derk’s family and the Spurs organization going public with the information. There was an overwhelming need to know, evinced by the media barrage and the remarkable groundswell of public support once Derk’s condition was made public, which easily overrode the typical willingness of a fan base to buy into the suspension of disbelief manifest in engaging with a mascot.  The Coyote has remained a fixture at Spurs games even while Derk continues rehab, and now, Derk’s legacy and years of service adds an additional layer of legend to The Coyote. It wouldn’t at all be surprising if his number (the cryptic “2!” – standing for “too excited”) is retired should Derk decide not to resume his role as The Coyote – though he’s not ruling out a return to the court, depending on how his physical therapy sessions go.  What the situation with The Coyote reveals, aside from the connection that fans have with a mascot, is the importance of the mascot in articulating the team’s identity, even beyond the role it might have had in years past. If you’re looking to point fingers as why it’s harder for teams to bank on the marketability of its star players, look no further than the era of free agency.  As a fan in his mid-30s, I might just be part of the last generation to know what it’s like to see a favorite player remain with a favorite team for the entirety of his career.  As a Mariners fan, I have seen Ken Griffey, Jr. go from Seattle fan favorite to trade-me malcontent, and now, I’m more likely to remember his statistical disappearing act as an oft-injured Cincinnati Red than as part of the Mariners’ feel-good father-son duo that once hit back-to-back home runs in a game on (and this is so terribly fitting) Father’s Day.  As a Mariners fan, I have seen Randy Johnson develop from wild-man anomaly to one of the most feared left-handed power pitchers in the history of the game – and then saw him help deliver a World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, a team that entered the majors as an expansion team long after the Mariners. (Note: it is not lost on me that the Mariners are closing in on three full decades of futility.) As I write this in July 2004, the Diamondbacks are contemplating trading him, and Johnson is hinting, not so subtly, that he’d like to become a Yankee. This is particularly cruel for Mariners fans who remember his role in defeating the Yankees in a five-game divisional series in the ’95 playoffs, a series which was not only deliciously epic, but pretty much allowed Mariners fans to hate the Yankees with a blend of loathing and jealousy only surpassed by Red Sox fans.   And I have seen the worst free-agency jump of all, for Mariners fans or otherwise, in Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod was drafted by the Mariners, came up quickly through the team’s farm system, was a wide-eyed September call-up in uniform for the ’95 playoffs, became the team’s most crucial player during its high-water mark as an organization, and then left for a $252 million contract (from a division rival, no less) that could be characterized by any reasonable observer as either obscene or insane. After several years of insisting money was not the motivating factor, even though he toiled for the Texas Rangers through several moribund seasons, he was jettisoned to the only team that could take his monstrous contract – the hated Yankees.   For minor league fans, inconstancy in the roster is a heartbreak that comes with the territory. It’s no accident that the minor leagues are referred to as the farm system – players are nurtured and then harvested, the wheat is separated from the chaff, and the cycle repeats itself annually.  But for major league fans, the free agent market has brought on an inconstancy that they assumed (correctly, up until now) they were immune from. Which makes the mascot more than just a sideshow to fill time and amuse the kids between innings – the mascot has become, more than any individual player, the face of the franchise, the one personality guaranteed to return year after year. The most dedicated baseball fans, addicted to statistics and the hope that comes with spring training, have turned to rotisserie leagues to insure that they can be in control of players maintaining their allegiance to teams – even if those teams are mere constructs in infinite variations among thousands upon thousands of makeshift leagues around the nation.  But, paradoxically, in the real world, the most enduring representative of what the team embodies is not a five-tool outfielder with a distinctive batting stance, or a pitcher with enough guile and raw talent to change the outcome of a game with his multi-million dollar arm, but a moose with a comically-large head, or an electric-blue marlin, or a non-descript green monster with a nose that vaguely resembles a trumpet. The pitcher and the outfielder might be dealt for prospects in the closing days of July, or might bolt to a contender at the first opportunity that MLB’s free agency rules afford them. The mascots, though, save for a conscious redirection of the team’s marketing people, are there to stay.   San Antonio is a city where people tend to settle in and grow old, and indeed, where multiple generations spend entire lifetimes. It’s a city where traditions are taken very seriously, where the two biggest institutional influences are the military and the Catholic Church. What this means, even with the rise of the Ballapeno, even with the rare convergence of animated jalapeno and animated taco in the same space, is that the Puffy Taco isn’t going anywhere. It’s perhaps no accident that Mickey Holt notes, “If we ever got rid of the Puffy Taco, we’d be crucified.  Yet, in talking to Wesley Ratliff, you get the sense that he will inevitably move on. He’s just entered his mid-20s and has already been a mascot for almost a decade. He’s come agonizingly close to toiling for Tampa Bay fans this year as a non-descript troll. He’s already had a glimpse of life as a big-league mascot, and he likes it. If anyone is cut out for the mascot’s life, Wesley is that person.  When he goes away, the mascot costumes will still remain – a jalapeno with googly eyes, and a taco with no eyes – waiting to be worn by someone who remain, if all goes to plan, anonymous. Though a different person will embody the role, the bio info on the team’s official website will remain the same, in the jokey tone and cadence that is common to mascot bios at all levels of the game.   And it’s a safe bet that years from now, between the 6th and 7th inning of future Missions games, the Puffy Taco will take his place at second base, and a child currently not yet born will take his or her place alongside the Taco. They will run around the bases. The Taco will not make it to home plate, being tackled along the way. It will be someone else’s knees taking the torque, enduring another child’s zeal manifest in a tackle. And as the Taco lies on the ground, to the cheers of the crowd for another in a chain of consecutive nights, the Taco will know his place is secure. In a city where traditions rule all, and in which the Taco has become a quirky and enduring tradition, no one will let the Taco escape this mortal coil. Even today, if you listen closely between the 6th and 7th inning as the Taco makes his entrance, underneath the cheers, you can hear a handful of people quickly explaining to those who don’t yet know – the children, the visitors, the neophytes – the answer to the inevitable question, the variations on the theme of What the Hell Is That.

"       Why is it that I always find places in my house to shove all those unwanted items.  I usually declare a drawer in my home as the 'junk drawer' and every time I get a piece of literature that looks interesting, but I don't have the time for, it undoubtedly gets crammed into the drawer for later viewing.  I eventually have to go through the crumpled up and mangled mess when I find I can't even close the silly thing.  I end up throwing most of it out without even taking a second glance at it.  And in my house, I don't just have a junk drawer. I have junk closets, and junk car trunks, junk cabinets, junk dresser drawers, junk corners....'oh, and the list can go on.  From the outside that drawer or closet or space looks neatly kept, but one look inside might have you thinking I am a housekeeping hypocrite.    This practical scenario plays itself out in my spiritual life, as well, more often than I would like.  I will hear the Holy Spirit say 'don't do that' or 'please do this' and I will cramm the thought or notion back into the 'unkept' places of my swirling mind.  Sweeping it under the rug works for a while-but eventually I trip on the massive bulge it creates under the rug.    The need to read God's word and pray and sing praises and meditate on him also gets crammed away into a corner of my heart that is ignored.  It gets so stuff at times, that I find myself in a spiritual depression.  I usually end up in a heap on the floor in my apartment asking the Lord to fix me.  I credit this to my human nature that thinks I can do everything on my own without help from God.  And I would contend to think that yes-for the most part-every day decisions, such as what I will wear and how long I'll sleep can be left up to me-but having a relationship with Jesus is more than just about me.  It is praying for those in need of prayer, helping those in need of help, meditating on the God who desires my desires, and singing praises to the one worthy of my praises.   I honestly don't know how to stop this cycle of the spiritual junk drawer, but I feel recognizing here and now is a huge step in the right direction.  Maybe those of you who read this can pray for me, and in some small way-it might be a catalyst for change.  This is Faith-signing out  Love in Christ-peace           "
"       This morning I got into my car, dreading the horrendous drive up Highway 52 to work.  I sat in the car parked in my driveway long enough to let the engine warm up and get to that 'just right' temperature. At this point I was still trying to get a few more z's so I hadn't turned my music on yet.  Needless to say I eventually left my driveway and began my drive to work.  Just as I headed out of the top of my driveway I turned up the volume to my car stereo.  I beautiful piano was playing and then a soothing calming voice came over the piano.  It was Nicole Nordeman.  I had bought the Woven & Spun cd a few weeks ago and had not really listened to the entire cd except a few choice songs.  This morning it was on the last song of the cd.  'Graditude'! As I listened to the words of this beautifully written song, my heart began to hurt.  My eyes began to blur with enormous tears.  It was the line that says 'Oh, the differences that often are between Everything we want and what we really need,' pierced me.  I began to ask myself 'what is the difference?'  For me the difference is greatfulness.  I have been far too ungreatful for what I have, always looking at what I don't have, or the lack there of.  Not enough clothes, not enough jewelry, shoes, cds, makeup, money, furniture, dishes, and no boyfriend.  Its really the last one that God really spoke to me about.  All I 'need' is Jesus and yet I am focusing on 'wanting' a boyfriend.  How foolish to wish my life away instead of acting in servanthood.  I pray now that I can remember this personal revelation from God tomorrow-tonight-as I watch other couples...and remember that God is husband-he is my friend-he is my father-he is everything that no man could ever be.   Another quick excerpt: I kinda got a double whammy today.  My mom had slipped Glamour magazine into my car yesterday while I was helping her and her husband move some things around their house.  I have steered clear of these kinds of magazines for the last six months-just because they cause me to be dissatisfied.  Let's just say-curiosity got this cat-and I took the magazine into work today (which-by the way-was a day from hades) and read it inbetween phone calls.  I happened to come across this article entitled 'Love will find you' (or something to that extent) and it caught my eye.  I was able to read the whole three page article without getting one interruption.  God really blessed me with this because it was very encouraging.  It reminded me that my life isn't over after my twenties. I can still meet someone and fall in love and get married and have babies and have a crazy wonderful family life.  I almost cried at my desk at work-but I didn't-can't let everyone know how silly crazy I am. : )   I can see that God is really working something out of me and into me.  My ungreatfulness has certainly caused me some frown wrinkles-I'm ready for the happy ones.    I just pray now-that God will remind me of this continually.  I pray Jesus for peace to know that you are planning a perfect will for me-and that I can not fathom all that you have for me. Thanks Jesus for your love and patience with me.  Thank you for all that you have given me, from material posessions to friends and family-you are gracious in all your ways.  Love-Faith 05-17-04          "
"       At my dad's this weekend in Henderson.  I've had an okay time, but there seems to be a lot of tension between my dad and Lisa.  Not sure what is going on...maybe it's Matt living here-I don't know.  All I really do know is how it affects me-its very saddening.  I don't think I could really deal with another break up.  They all mean so much to me.  If someone was to have told me five years ago that my parents would be divorced, and I would love new people, I would have laughed at them and contritely waved them away.  Shit happens, things change, and life moves on.  I think I can say that though I'm not happy about the divorce, I am happy with how I have grown because of it.  Wouldn't it suck if I couldn't learn from bad situations?  Yup-I think so.  I told God three days ago, that I would pray every day for a husband, until he brought me.  I'm serious about this one. I'm fed up with waiting.  I am having a hell of a time managing my temptive urges-boys are all around me-and even the ugly ones are beginning to look quite attractive.  I'm not lonely-it's just once you've opened the forbidden box of sex-it's hard to not want to open it again.  I have been succesful thus far in praying for a husband...but it's only day three...we'll see in two or three months-heck a week :)  I'm getting along much better with David and Mom as a couple.  I love them both and have really come to respect each of them together and separately.  I am not sure why it took me so long to accept David.  Mostly because I thought he wasn't good enough for her, based on his looks. He's certainly not what I consider good looking-but his intelligence and compassion certainly make up for it.  Sure-he's heavey handed and loud mouthed-but then again-maybe I am too.   eXpedition: is okay-I'm a little disenchanted with it at this point-and having a hard time sticking in there.  I would love to move on to another church that is much more stable and established.  But it seems to be my pattern that I leave when it gets too tough-so I'm just asking God to help me through the hard time.  God-if you read this-which you are probably doing now-please help me.  I need you to move in my friendships at eXpedition and help me to better serve those in the church.  I want to bless those around me-but I can't if everyone hates me due to misconceptions presented by tainted opinions.  Help me to love Courtney. If I could beat her up in a dark alley somewhere, I would-but I know that's not right, and deep in my heart I do love her, it's just hard to show it when she insists on hurting me. But God is bigger than my feelings and my fleshly desires.  I'm missing Drew like crazy.  He hasn't written me any email-not called-no letter-nothing.  I feel like discarded trash-and it's hard to understand why he doesn't communicate in some manner.  If he does love me, even as a close friend, why doesn't he contact me? Doesn't he realize that, that is what friends do?  Guess not.  I did send him two emails-the first was really encouraging-the second relayed irritation and frustration.  I plan on sending him a letter to let him know how I really feel, but I need an address first.  I was watching Tombstone tonight, and there is a scene at the end where Jody looks in the mirror after a show.  She's not looking at herself, but instead looking into the future with regret, regret that she didn't tell Wyatt exactly how she felt, that she didn't care about any of his faults, and just wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.  I identified greatly with that look-and felt a twinge of pain in the pit of soul, that I too, would one day feel this.  God-please don't let this happen to me.  Well-guess that's enough for now.  I love my life God-I just want someone to share it with.  Love-Faith         "

"       Hoping to find purpose, find direction, To end the wandering, destroy the void, Why must they always be here, never leaving, How can I escape from this place, boundaries.  Boundaries set by me, restricted by same, Walls enclosing, thirsty in a desert of illusion, Hungry in a sea of emptiness, Lost inside a map.  Needing something, but I know not what, Capture by meaningless, drowned by routine, Impatience persists, calculated to perpetuate, Hollowness, and fear.  Doubt creeping back into the mind, Worth decreasing systematically, Shadow clouding my soul, Poisoning my heart.  Progress past forgotten, Reversion to the horizon With darkness in the forecast, And a rut in the mud.  How do I escape… How do I defeat… How do I move… How do I see light… How do I avoid past mistakes… How do I beat setback… How do I step forward… How do I wander aimlessly again… How do I handle torture… How do I fight demons… How do I survive….  Do I survive?          "
"       I have been thinking a lot so far this summer, just about my life in general, law school, and its direction.  Law school has started to become a double edged sword in my life.  I love the intellectual challenge, the order that the law can potentially bring to things, and the opportunity it can give.  At the same time, law school seems very dark.  Most people are pessimistic and distrusting concerning human nature.  Sometimes, the nature of the very inquiries we are being trained to make assumes that people are inherently bad, and  that when someone acts in an honorable and noble way, that it is the exception.  Maybe this is true of all of society, but I know that the concept is overwhelmingly prevalent at law school.  Anyway, I am not sure where I am going with this, it just something that has occupied some of my thinking lately.  In addition, with Jackie graduating from SJC, she is now 2 to 2 1/2 hours away...and with her working two jobs, me in classes, gas prices being what they are, just seems like a recipe for a very stressful summer.  The worse is that the future is so open ended with her job...depending on if and where she finds a teaching job, the next year before our marriage could end being very trying...trying not on the relationship, just on each of us individually.  When she comes to visit, I am able to deal with the stress of classes better, I laugh more, I live more, and in general and a much happier person.  Being here by myself leaves me alone with my thoughts too much, and I don't like where my mind goes sometimes.  Overall, depressing thoughts have started to creep back into my life, and I hate that they have, especially when I know that there is so much good present in my life.  Seems like things pile on... the uncertainty concerning the next year and beyond, the dissatisfaction with the atmosphere of law school, the living alone, hardly seeing Jackie or my other friends, and questioning what I should be doing with my life...  Part of my overall frustration with things I know is traceable to the fact that I don't have a job this summer and I'm stuck taking summer classes.  I know that the classes are better than doing nothing and working a typical summer job, but oddly enough, I miss working...I miss the feeling of doing something productive and seeing the results of it, a weird advantage to those summer jobs.  My life has turned into a routine of books...which wouldn't be all that bad if I were choosing the books, and maybe doing some writing, instead of reading law case books and just having to attempt to hold onto all the information...  At this point, I just hit on something...'maybe doing some writing.'  I have always held that in the back of my mind, that I would love to write.  Problems are that I do not possess good technical writing skills, and I can never decide on a direction, so anything I start to write seems to be completely sporadic, much like this and other journal entries.  Sometimes I think that writing might be a solution for me, something that would give more purpose than just the law school, but something the law school could help me with.  Still, it always comes back to the issue of what would I write about, what topic or group of topics would interest me sufficiently to put the time and effort into writing something substantial.  I think about writing about some philosophical ideas, but I am to indecisive about those topics, and not sure if I can really discuss them at a great depth.  I then think about writing about religion, and specifically my experiences with it and how I came to discover God again, and the general relations between the religions that I see, but who is interested in what I think...in reality, the only aspect concerning religion that I feel a lot of passion about is how people tend to compartmentalize their life, and leave religion, God, and so forth out of their day to day routines...but I don't think I could write for very long on that, which would then turn into an essay and nothing substantive, and I'v written essays, I have this desire to write something more substantial, something that is thoroughly in depth on a subject...and then I wonder if I have the patience to actually write something that is substantial and thorough.  Oh well, I guess I have exhuasted some of my thoughts for now...I will leave myself with a message from the Dalai Lama, words of wisdom...  'It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow.  All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties,  This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can me the problem seem very intense.  When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help - realizing, for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences.  This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in certain illnesses or when in pain.  At the time the pain arises it is of course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices to calm the mind.  But if you can make comparisons, view your situation from a different perspective, somehow something happens.  If you only look at that one event, then it appears bigger and bigger.  If you focus too closely, too intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable.  But if you compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming.'  Random quote 'Worry is the activity of the mind which does not understand it connection with Me' - God         "
"       Didn't know what to put for the title, just something to represent how I am thinking.  I have finals next week and then the summer session will be over, which I have very glad about.  I have noticed how tired I am this last week, and how much I really need a break from law school, just a chance to recooperate my focus and ethic.  I am starting to experience with some user friendly linux alternatives to windows...in part due to my frustration in dealing with Microsoft products and in part to support the ideal of capitalism by lending support to the competitor.  I have even started using a different word processor to get away from the autoformatting that Microsoft Word always does and ends up annoying me in the process.  Anyway, I have also noticed that the urging to write something that I mentioned a few weeks ago has not gone away, but I still have no idea as to what and how and so forth...but maybe, after finals, something will come to me and I can start writing something.  On to some thoughts...  I had a discussion last night that made me think hard about being alone/loneliness and similar states.  Specifically, I am thinking about what distinguishes the two states.  I mean, one can be alone without being lonely, but what makes it that way.  As I am writing this, I think that I need to think a little more in order to make my thoughts a little more coherent.  I remember reading a book a few years back called 'Solitude' and am thinking of going back to that book to reflect more on my thinking.  Anyway, I will get back to this...         "
"       I have been noticing as of late that I have had a hard time paying attention in my summer classes, not sure if it is because it is the summer, or if I am just tired from the previous year.  But the class I am in now, The Legal Process, is by far the most bring class I have ever taken.  The reading is horrendous, like reading a Math textbook where it gives you the problems then the answer right after it, so there is no thinking involved, like a book is lecturing.  Then to make matters worse, in class we rarely cover anything that is not in the book, so we just end up repeating the textbook.  The only time we leave the text is when the professor points us to some article or review that he is written and what his thesis is.  And, if you have a question, you will never get called on.  Last class, a guy had his hand up for 20 minutes, the professor looked right at him while he was lecturing, and kept going and never stopped to see what the question was.  This summer I have gained experience with two new professors at the school, and I am not impressed with either, I actually rearranged my schedule for the fall and spring so I could avoid taking them.  My professors during my first year were all really good at teaching, with mixing lecture and questions, and did an excellent job in relating the relevant material.  These two professors this summer lack all of those characteristics.  Anyway, enough of the complaining.  Lately, I was surfing randomly over the web and came upon information concerning the Baha'i faith.  I was really fascinated by what I read and learned, and found that much of what they believe relates to things I have thought about in the past.  I especially liked the concept of continual revelation through the 'manifestations' of all of the major religions.  I also liked the concept of breaking down the barriers between people and working towards actual unity in the world and justice for every human being.  They also provided this free download of a library that has roughly 1,000 texts from various religions.  The majority of the texts are from the Baha'i faith, but there was literature from Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and more, and it is an awesome tool to research different concepts of the religions and be able to quickly compare them to each other.  I plan on doing so more research into the Baha'i faith, probably not to adoption, but probably similar to my relation to Buddhism, where I read the literature and embrace the ideas within the framework of my own spirituality and beliefs.  In the spirit of my inquiry into the Baha'i faith, here is a short excerpt from a Compilation concerning Scholarship within the Baha'i faith:  'Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God.  It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it.  Such arts and material means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdon which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen - a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent.  Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.  The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words.  Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world...In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, or bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him.'         "
"       It is our mind that creates this world  I found this quote from The Buddha while I was looking for some are online today, and I really like it.  It puts into words very accurately and concisely how important I believe perspective is.  I think it is unfortunate that at times we hear the cliché about how important attitude is that whenever we hear it we quickly dismiss it by stating that “we know” and “I’ve heard that.”  And I do mean dismiss…I am not sure we really realize how significant our perspective is.  From any point of view, philosophical, skepticism, religious, pragmatism, cynicism, and so forth all recognize the importance of perspective, while creating the interesting situation of being a perspective themselves, talking about the importance of perspective.  But here is one short and quick argument for the absolute superiority of perspective.  Philosophically speaking, nothing in this world, including the world, can be proven to exist.  Descartes’ famous “I think therefore I am” is actually inadequate to prove one’s existence, as it assumes being before the being thinks when the statement is deconstructed.  The best that can be said is that there I doubt, and doubt implies a doubter, but there is no guarantee that the doubt is “your” doubt.  Science, which many people prove to, is based on a reasoning method known as induction.  Deductive arguments proves something is true if the premises are true.  Induction, which is science, makes it so that if the premises are true, the conclusion is only probably true.  This means that all of the scientific “truths” of our world…i.e. gravity, light, sound, and the discoveries of biology, chemistry, and physics, and so forth, since they are all based on our senses and our interpretation of our senses, is induction, and therefore gravity, although our experience, which may not really be our own remember, tells us that it is always true.  However, the point is that technically and logically speaking, all scientific truths are only probably true. This argument is only offered to show that since so much of our everyday world is unknown, and consequently very much out of out control in our everyday actions, that how we view the world may be the one aspect of our existence that we truly can exercise complete control over.  Everything else, our knowledge, our experience, and our science are all, to some extent, outside of our control.  Whereas, our perspective, while it can be influenced by external forces such as family, society, and circumstance, is something that can be determined independently.  When determining our perspective, we can consider these factors and reject our accept them, their influence, in an ultimate sense, is dependent on us. This is very elementary at this point, but just something that I was thinking about…possibly the beginnings of something more involved and detailed.  Just trying to show how important perspective is and how it may be the only thing that we can really control, and how we should have more respect for it.           "
"       Well, I am having some serious motivational problems right now.  The case comment for the law review competition is due on Friday, and I haven't done anything for it.  Part of me is starting not to care about it...all you hear about is how hard it is and how time consuming it becomes.  But with my grades being a bit lower than I would like, I feel like I have to at least try and make it, even though in the back of my head I am pretty sure that there is no way in hell that I am going to make Law Review.  Considering that I am going to spend two days on it, and I will need to either pull an all nighter tonight, tomorrow night, or Thursday night, and I am pretty tired right now, so tonight is probably not going to happen.  This most likely means that I will have to stay up for both tomorrow and Thursday night, which will make my trip to Indy on Friday morning interesting...but at least all I have to do when I get back is crash and sleep for a day and half before helping Justin load some stuff and head over to Fort Wayne to see Jackie.  Anyway, I guess that is about it for now, I think I will head to bed early tonight to try and get some good sleep so I can be as productive as possible tomorrow working on the case comment...hopefully I can at least get six pages of it done, which would be half of the maximum were are allowed.  Oh well, enough for now, off to bed...zzzzzzzzzzzz         "
"       little bit hungry right now, so now sure how long this will be.  Thinking about the word hungry, outside of the physical sense, I wonder what I am hungry for in life.  This past weekend Jackie and I went camping with my familiy and I met my (step)nephew for the first time and was able to spend some time with him.  It made me realize more than before how much I want a kid, and more to the point, how much I want the experience of being a father.  I get doses of solitude in my daily life, I get little doses of fellowship when I talk to friends online, be it email or instant messenging.  I get large doses of fellowship whenever I am able to talk to a friend on the phone or meet up and have dinner, hang out, and so forth with one or a group of friends.  I get doses of love whenever I talk to Jackie, and almost always become overwhelmed with it when we can just be with each other.  I get doses of the divine when I pray, meditate, and take in the wonder of the world around me.  I get all of this, yet I still feel a yearning...I know some of it is a spiritual yearning, to have a deeper understanding and relationship with the Divine, but after the past weekend, I feel that some of it is also a yearning to be a father.  Just a matter of being patient I guess....    I have been thinking more and more lately about the spiritual yearning/emptiness/hunger that I have been feeling.  It never seems to predominant me, but it seems like it is always just there, nagging at me for some reason.  I have gone to church in the last few weeks, but I have never been able to put myself forward and worship like that...just not me.  At SJC, I got involved with retreats and Faith Group and I think that really was my form of worship, and enabled me to really connect with God more so than ever before.  This last year at law school, I got involved with the Christian Legal Society and the Bible Study, and I think that came close to do the same thing, closer to the kind of worship that I think I am able to best do and form the best relationship with God.  More and more, I realize that whatever church Jackie and I end up attending in the future, I need to be looking for one that has a lot more than just the Sunday worship, one with small informal gatherings of people dicussing faith, God, life, and experiencing fellowship in that way.  Anyway, like I said at the very beginning, getting hungry so I am going to make some dinner...           "
"         A lot has been going on since I last wrote in here.   First and most importantly, Jackie moved to Elkhart about two weeks ago.  Consequently, most of my time has been spent there to attempt to help her adjust to living on her own...I know that she does not like it at all.  I am just hoping that it becomes like last year at SJC was, where she was able to get so busy she didn't have the down time to think about being alone.  Otherwise, she will probably end up being miserable for the next year living there, which will just make the year incredibly stressful for both us.  The good news is that we only have 10 months or so before the wedding and the beginning of our marriage and the end of living apart at great distances.  The experience of living apart has been incredibly difficult, especially after coming from SJC where you saw each other every day and for many hours.  I think it has helped us put things in perspective to better appreciate each other and to be more patient individuals, but despite the possible good things it has been a hard road, and I am looking forward to its end.  In other good news I found out about a week ago that I made law review.  I am very excited about it.  After I turned in my case comment I was pretty doubtful about it...anyway, making it will be a big boost to my law school career, and hopefully help my get a job in the location that I want.  I also bought my books earlier today, always amazes me how expensive they are, makes my book purchases at undergrad look small.  Oh well, I guess education is expensive.  I am looking forward to the beginning of the school year...near the end of summer classes I was completely burned out...but now having a couple weeks of being able to relax and read things of my own picking have helped me get energy again for another go around.  It will be a taxing year...classes being harder, law review, the job hunting process, and I still hope to get more involved with CLS...but I am looking forward to the challenge.   I finally saw Nick on Tuesday night and was able to ask him about being co-best man at my wedding.  My wedding party is now set...and I can't help but think about how blessed I am to have the friends that I do, and to be as close to them as I am.  One thing I have always loved about the group of friends that I am in is the diversity of interests and talents.  When at SJC, we were all involved in some stuff together, but we also were individually involved in other areas, and for the most part, were all studying different disciplines.  Now, post SJC, we all are doing different things, working different type of jobs, some related to our degree, some not, some taking grad classes part time, some full time...I just love being able to be in the large group and talk and realize how many different things that we are doing.  Anyway, can't think of anything else to write about for the moment...guess it's time to make something for dinner...            "

"       Ok can anyone enlighten me here has to how I list other people's blogs on mine as I can't find anywhere where I can do it, it's probably staring me right in the face, cause sometimes I can't see for looking!!!!  Kate.     "
"       Just read this that someone posted on the OS, is it me or does he mention 3 different releases here......  From Ross Halfin's Diary on his website:  Thought I'd have a lazy Sunday. Checked my diary and realised the person who does it hasn't put any recent pictures up.....I'll rectify this today. Speak to Phil Collen, haven't spoken to him in a year, he tells me there's a Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD coming out for Christmas (again) and a rock version of Vault. He thinks the record company are flogging a dead horse and he's had nothing to do with it. He's in London for a couple of weeks. Told him Joe had played me the covers album they'd done....Phil seemed very disheartened by it all....I must say they've done a great version of Rock On by David Essex (won't tell you the rest as it'll spoil it).  1. Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD 2. Rock version of Vault (or does he mean the above is a rock version of Vault) 3. Covers album  Why would they release 3 all round about the same time, although not sure when the cover album is due, they ought to call one of em Dazed and Confused cause I know I am lol.  Kate.

"       I can't believe the weekend is nearly over, I haven't done anything hardly apart from recover all day yesterday from Friday night out with the girls, then got rid of 5 black bin liners of crap from the spare bedroom today, where it came form I've no idea as it doesn't look like there's less stuff in there.  Oh well feel better for the clean out.  Didn't have the internet last night as hubby was messing with the cables, I felt so lost, I didn't realise how much I use it and depended on it, have I no life lol?  Kate.     "
"       Driving to work I saw this Sky TV van parked at the side of the road, I nearly crashed the car as the paintwork on it was huge leopard print, covered every inch of it, it was soooo cool.  I'm so glad it's Friday, it's been the longest week of my life.  Kate.     "
"       Ooh I can't wait till tomorrow is over and the weekend is here, its been one hell of a week at work for me, everything has gone wrong, it got so bad at one point I could have said stuff this and walked right out.  Yeeeeaaaahh........my friend just phoned to see if I want a girlie night out tomorrow night....you bet I do, yeahhaaa................baby it's showtime!!!!  Kate.      "
"       Well I thought it was about time I started a Blog seeing as it seems to be the craze of late, don't know how it will take off, I might even get bored at some point with it but we will see.  Kate.     "

"   Ok, I'm writing up a syllabus for my literature class which will start in about two weeks.  They've changed the edition of the anthology. Certainly, I am glad to see that Shakespeare still matters--indeed! However, I'm getting annoyed with the enduring myth which claims Shakespeare's sonnets were written in the early 1590s.   Do these editors who put together these anthologies even read the latest scholarship?  I don't care what tradition holds. So sometime around 1595, Frances Meres writes that Shakespeare's Sonnets, were 'sugared,' and that is supposed to tack a date down for us?  Katherine Duncan-Jones, in her latest edition of the sonnets, has suggested otherwise; maybe as early as 1603, to perhaps as late as 1608-9. I tend to agree.    Let us consider the notion of revision for once. Shakespeare may have written some sonnets around or before the time of Romeo and Juliet, early 1590s, 1594-95, but most of the sonnets are indeed problematic, and dark, and cynical just as the latter 'problem' plays, which were written after the new millennia--1600. Surely before the publication, he had time to revise, being that the theaters had been closed and problems of plague in London.   I find absolutely nothing in these poems which suggest any notion of Meres' 'sugared' sweetness, but scholarly tradition is adamant. Yet still, I think the common assumption is wrong. Let's just look at 'sweetness' in the poems:            'For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,             Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds'              (94,13-14).   Clearly, the lines are anti-sweet; in fact, the speaker seems to suggest just the opposite. Weeds are preferred over a multitude of sweet smelling flowers.  The image is not nice: weeds are better than flowers.  Really, who would rather have weeds instead of an abundance of growing flowers?    And again, the couplet of Sonnet 118:             'But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,             Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you'              (118, 13-14).   The language and imagery here evoke the illness and bitterness of being in 'Love.'  This speaker is jaded.  He's not sweetly in love; he has been poisoned by her. And this whole, 'sick of you.' It lingers.  It's like he's saying, 'I'm sick of you, and how you intoxicate me, enchant me, as if I'm taking a bad drug.' It's like a chemotherapy experience to him.  And certainly last but not least, Sonnet 147, one of my favorites,                  'For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,          Who art as black as hell, as dark as night'           (147, 13-14).   Clearly the speaker, is disillusioned.  He once thought his beloved to be bright and angelic, but now he concludes that she is a diabolical imp. Essentially, he's telling her 'you are a lover from hell!'  Is that a sweet term of endearment?  And certainly, I could go on and on.  There might be a few sonnets which evoke 'pathos.'  However, debatable, how does one explain the cynicism as revealed in these couplets?  And it is just not these three poems.  All over the sequence there is this underlying sentiment of despair, frustration, and exhaustion.    My point in all of this?  How can scholars be so rigid in suggesting that these poems are indicative of a less mature Shakespeare? By asserting that these poems were indeed written in the early 1590s, we dismiss the complexity, the cynicism, the sexual frustration, and the over all peculiarity of these poems.   I don't believe that the Shakespeare who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet' could have written these poems.  This speaker/lover does not 'Kiss by the book,' as Juliet would say.  No, this speaker is misogynistic like Hamlet, and he's disillusioned like King Lear, and slightly jaded like Prospero! These poems have been revised, and were written by an older Shakespeare probably around 1603, and then published in 1609.    Somebody at the MLA please get the word out!            Jumbled Chaos   "
"   'Witchcraft,' I don't know why I've developed this strange pre-occupation with Frank Sinatra.  I never listened to him while he was alive. But the day he died, I walked into the local coffee dive and suddenly, I discovered him. It was a tribute, and I was getting a posthumous revelation. H-- & V think I'm a little crazy!  But really, he's quite deep!   My whole life seems like that; I'm always catching things after the fact. I missed meeting the beautiful and great DWM's, Shakespeare and Milton. I missed the French revolution; I missed the roaring twenties. I even missed Che Guevara, and the sixties! I missed the sixties by being born. Hah!   I suppose I am a little nutty.  Nonetheless, My grades are done!  I was having anxiety dreams over all of those papers; I graded every last one. Now, I am feeling like I'm experiencing some sort of recoil, still slightly swirling, I don't know what to do with myself.       J spoke with me a lot this week.  I'm might have gone out with him, but I had been too distracted.  What I mean is-- that I don't think it is too healthy turning to J as I'm reeling from K.  So maybe this coming week, if the weather of my heart is a little more clear, dissipated, I'll go out with him.  I do like J, and I want to be fair to him.  I just don't want to look at him and think, 'How come K isn't like you?'   But J has his own charisma. He let me know a bit about himself.  Both of his parents are teachers. He lived in Europe for several years, and he loves the French!  You know what else?  He's so, so, nice!  That right there made me drop my papers right in front of him, and start stumbling over my words... Ah yes, intelligent young woman suddenly turns stupid syndrome returns!    And that's just it; I never have had to play stupid around a guy, and I would never,  ever , lower myself!  When my smart girl friends play stupid to catch an idiot, it really irritates me. How demeaning! If the guy can't like you for your brain, then it is all a lie!  But when I am really  REALLY,  attracted to a guy, I do suddenly go brain dead!  It takes me a time to gather my wits about me...  In my mind, I'm still stuck on, 'Oh my God, he's so cute, and so funny, and he's just so, so, so...'  Usually, I can tell if I'm moved by the guy in view just by my tone, my humor, and if I've dropped something!    Oh, I'll have to share some of the more momentous instances where I've dropped or spilled something in front of a possible lover. Sometimes, I am such a dork! I wonder would what Freud would think of my infatuation symptoms...   On Tuesday, I carefully pulled my grade reports out of my box.  I held them firmly in my hand.  I went through my box pulling other things, books and what not.  I was in the office area not really focused on anything.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow of a figure pass by the door. J! He stuck his head in, and then rushed in the room.  I looked at his beautiful blue eyes, and I suddenly felt so self conscious.  I kept fidgeting with my shirt and running my fingers through my hair.  And of course, I couldn't help, but smile and laugh! I'm not sure what we were talking about in those first few minutes.  I just remember him saying something about 'Santa Cruz.' I was thinking of that old Police song, 'Do, Do, Do, Da, Da, Da, is all I want to say to you,' just fuzz. Then to snap myself back, I said, 'Of course, near John Steinbeck country...' I told him I grew up 'behind the orange curtain' in Southern California.  At that moment, I thought I was really being my witty self again, but when I moved to the center of the room, my eyes grazed the floor.  The grade reports had landed so nicely, spread out like we were going to do a ground view. He picked up all the papers.  Didn't even say word.  As to how I loosened my grip? I don't know. Certainly, I had been intent on being smart and non-angular. I thought I had it together!!!    In the meantime, the secretary kept distracting him.  Apparently, she wasn't too pleased with our conversation. Jim rolled his eyes a bit. I looked at the time, and knew I had to go.  But J whispered, 'Come with me to my office...'  So there I went!  Too cute!  I kept looking at him, and he kept looking at me.  He asked my age indirectly.  I told him, 'I'm going to be depressed when I turn 35; maybe, I'll get drunk.'  He hesitated for a moment and said in a soft sweet tone, 'When I turned 35, I was in love!'  I felt that one;  I really felt that one!  Trying to disguise my warmth, my red face, I smiled and said, 'Well, that's always so nice to be in love...'  He then gave a qualifier, 'It's over now...'  He told me that he is 37!  Ah! Perfect!  Too cute!    I went on my way after he told me a bit more about his life,  that he managed a bar in a small town in the North West. I don't know why it is so important for him to tell me his story.  Ok, so now I'm really being dumb!  He likes me too. Good! Very good!   Ok, one more instance...  I had to call him the next day to ask about a grading issue. Again, We had a very nice conversation.  He said, 'Are you Italian?'  I said, 'I'm pretty much French...'  'Then,' he explained in that sweet, soft tone, 'Don't feel guilty for giving that student an F; The French have no conscience, remember?'  I had to laugh!  The guy makes me laugh too!  He went on to tell me that he knows a bunch of bad words in French.  I didn't bother volunteering my French potty mouth; I mean, when you grow up with a French father, you get accustomed to hearing 'Putaine' this and 'Sallop' that.  Yet still, he then said something really, really, cute, 'Well, when we have a more personal moment together, I'll have tell you all the bad French words I know...'    Provocative indeed! So we ended it there. When I dropped off my grades on Wednesday, I didn't want to go by his office. I just thought I should give myself a bit of space; I want to be sure that I don't have any of K's prickles and stings left.   But I must say, I think I'm looking forward to this 'personal moment'... Indeed, Jumbled Chaos              "
"   I know what my problem is! It's not like I'm in denial! I have long since accepted the fact that  I am too romantic  for my own good.  Troubling, and yet those closest to me have always said, 'You're smart too, so that should shield you somewhat!'     It's not good to be in love with love at my age.  It hurts more, or maybe I'm lamenting my own foolish wound--again!  Let me make an appeal to my vague and silent audience here; I'm sorry if my posts are a bit melodramatic, un-novel. Really, I am an interesting person, yet I tend to forget that there are a plethora of individuals, who I'm sure have and are, experiencing the same loss of connection with the other gender/or the same gender,depending on preference, of course.    You see, I see what my problem is, but I am unable to move away from it.  I have tried NOT to be romantic, but it always gets jumbled.  Let me be more specific here: reading Pablo Neruda... The last line of 'Everyday you play with the universe: I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.'  That line just moves me!  I could read the poem again and again, and it hits me!  WOW!    I remember in graduate school friends talking about what it would have been like to have made love to Keats, or Yeats.  I had to laugh because, in my head, I was thinking I'd always be second fiddle to Fanny Brawne, and Maud Gonne.  But Neruda, or Marlowe, or Shakespeare--Oh, incredible indeed!  'Come with me and be my love...'  Or, 'Love's fire heats water, Water cools not Love,' would be something I certainly would want to explore!   And it's not just the poetry.  It's my way of seeing things.  I love rain.  I love to go out in it, getting soaked, feeling and understanding what's around me. Or Taking a ride in the Jemez mountains, seeing the bright red earth amid the green of juniper against a perwinkinle sky, just makes me love.  It makes me feel in love, and want to love and be loved!  Or twilight around here; I can look up at a vivid sky, in this deep, deep blue, seeing one big star, and it speaks to me.  Pathetic romantic indeed!  And to waste a southwestern sunset on K!  Like he could understand that there never will be another one exactly, exactly, the same! He is a want-to-be romantic, and when a want-to-be, you tend to be pretentious, if not, artificial.    So much for imitations... Just now, I remember a conversation with the beautiful and brilliant EB.  We were walking around somewhere, probably to class, and out of the blue he said, 'My problem, is that I'm too much of a romantic...'  When he said that, I looked at him,  REALLY LOOKED AT HIM, .  Again, it occurred to me that he could have been in my bedroom listening to me speak at night. I couldn't really define this uncanny substance of Plato's otherness between us, so I smiled and said, 'It's a curse, isn't it?'  And then I looked up at the sky so I didn't have to look into his eyes and he said, 'It's a beautiful sky, isn't it, ' and I said, 'Yes.'   What can I say?  The man seemed to speak the language of my soul!  I suppose it is not good to remember so much about him; I need to give my next lover his own throne room of romantic intonations.  I have to put EB back in the museum...    Back to work, Jumbled Chaos      "
"   Grades are due on Weds. Ok, so right now I should be grading the pile of provocative research papers sitting on my right--hah! No comment!  I was getting sleepy. I'm also doing laundry.  I seem to be doing a lot of laundry the past few days.  But I suppose it is something I need to do: washing out my soul.  What is this Monday? I realize something about myself; I think I'd like a nice guy in my life.  I wanted not to think about K, so I read Edith Wharton's 'The Buccaneers' in,like, two days.  Yes, it was her last novel, incomplete, and I could sense where the other writer completed it.  In the end, the language was too late twentieth century.  Kind of like when you read the last of Shakespeare's plays, you can tell where Fletcher moves in.  But anyway Back to Wharton,  Guy Thwarte, is our hero in this novel.  He is everything Ethan Frome, and Newland Archer are not.  It seems to me at least, that Wharton finally wanted to create a male character who is able to live outside convention. Thwarte has this wonderful ability to be a nonconformist.  He's so nice, sincere, kind, respectful, romantic as hell, and he gets it.  He understands that life is more than what we have--things, things, things! He's just content to live comprehending poetry and art and Love!   Ahhh!    Maybe, I shouldn't read novels like this when I am in such a romantically disillusioned state. I must say, today, I am in love with Guy Thwarte! He was having a conversation with our heroine, Annabell (Nan)St. James, and he talks about this notion of 'beyondness.'  In the strict setting of order and tradition where they find themselves, the lovers both share an understanding of the beauty of life.  They both know that it cannot be defined with money, or influence, but rather through art, culture, & a deep passion for humanity.    Oh, maybe my heart is just hurting a little!  I don't even feel jaded because I knew how K was made.  But, I just don't understand his meanness (is that a word?). It's something so foreign.  Why be sour?   I just need to be 'got', I suppose.  I need to meet the right Guy. I'm not really lonely.  I know how that feels, and it is something I'm not ashamed of, but it would just be nice to be understood by the other gender.  One who says, 'I get you, and your nutty jumbled chaos.'   And while I'm making all these intimate disclosures, I may as well write it--I need to be Kissed.  K--didn't kiss too well!  I could really use a deep kiss by a sweet and brainy and dreamy guy who speaks my language!  And a long gaze too!  A very long gaze into my eyes--yes, indeed!  enough written, & I'm so glad nobody reads this gushing. (Nobody, right? uhm blush)  Jumbled Chaos "
"   'Thinking, tangling, shadows' as it translates in English is one of my favorite Neruda poems.  I have been rather pensive today--not withdrawn, just thinking about my life.  I am so happy that my life is MY LIFE, and I am not at all envious of another life.  And I know that life can be complicated, but you know what, it is my deal here.    I just can't be cynical about life.  I love it!  Hah!  When I was talking with K   over dinner he kept saying, 'Life is hard, and my students will come to understand that!'  Or something to that effect.  Thank God, I teach non traditional college students; yes, I leave my students to debate the cruelty, and relative ease of life in writing.  I only desire that they write something interesting, and when they come to my class, they leave all bad mojo out the door!   But K kept talking about suffering... Who doesn't suffer in life? Yes indeed as Shakespeare put in the mouth of Romeo: 'He jests at scars that never felt a wound...' I can think about my sufferings; And it's really ok. Despite my bitter wounds, my life is so, so, good!  Hah!  I just can't share his reality of angst!  I should have said to him, 'PLEASE, just get OFF the CROSS!'  The mutual and I conversed this morning... I just wanted to hear from a voice away what K thought of the work. Funny thing, K barely said a word to him.  K told the mutual,'it looks pretty good!'  And that was that!  You're damn right it was 'pretty good!'  I suppose he does feel threatened by me--hah!  Or maybe that's just my vanity!!! Either way, I've yet to get a message from K! But I'm really not expecting it either!      Since I was having this EB relapse brought on by the amazing and gentle K,(notice my sarcasm?), I thought I'd put up some poems. Only the first poem is new; I wrote it about a month ago.  The others were written about three or so years ago...     ~For just one day,  Beneath a white sheet and a thick blanket, watching the sun uncover the Sandia Crest, Your strong man legs wrapped around my legs,  all quiet, all calm, hearing you breathe when  we sip fresh coffee, What I would give for just one day--  A day made for whispers and laughter where You would take my hands to your mouth, kiss my fingers, and utter, 'I love you, I love you!'   If I had only a day, A day like that where you touch my eyes with your eyes, my splintered heart  finding its way into yours, A day made for soft words,  where you tell me of your day before, where I tell you of the night before, where we just remember like the scent of coffee, like day after a rainy day,  You speak, I hear I hear you whisper my name,  You whisper 'history, Neruda, anarchy, or chickadee,'   It doesn't matter, To hear only your voice, my laugh, your laugh, to feel, to see, to know today your fingers roam through my curly hair, as my nails  gently brush your forearm, and in broad daylight you You toss the blanket over our heads, surely on such a day,  we would know  we would remember then, we both would know, know what it is to love again.      ~Deluge  I want to think of you as rain now, like July rain quenching Albuquerque, spilling on UNM or TV-I. I just want to think of you as rain, not as a shattered word in a broken glass, or a bitter glaze in rancid milk,  Love I want to hear you  like I listen to the rain, if just to hear you say, 'Baseball, Putumayo, a Trotsky dream,   if the stars were French,' if only you'd say my name if only you'd come to me,   Overdue kisses would flood infectious glances, Black clouds could gather our parched souls,   tears in dusty arroyos, the water would be here, with lightning, with healing, rushing, it all would appear, fresh mud in Tijeras and thickness of love.     ~What Love Is~  If you ask me what love is, I can only tell you of  waves that die at their peak, of a trail of sand lost to the  wind, and the wail  of seagulls. If you ask me If I know how to love,  perhaps I could answer,  with the grin of a flirt in denial, and with what happens in a cafeteria after a history class, or with hands that reach through you  like air, like water, Oh, I understand how love is: even the solitude of an oceanic sunset makes me weep, One cannot look into  the face of love  and easily forget.      These last two poems are together; they are loss & hope.     ~You say we all have a story to tell:  It snowed the day after Christmas in Albuquerque, but nobody nobody saw us making our way past the soaking luminarias with the dogs. There were no ears that heard us laughing as we waited in line for our coffee and Frontier roll.    No, there wasn't anyone to see us running the north golf course at  sunset, or unfolding your picnic of fresh fruits, a baguette,  and wine in Hidden Park No one saw our hungry kisses in the corridor of Nob Hill Center today, No one saw you greedily reach for my hand as we crossed Central into the book store, You did not read Neruda to me in Spanish, we did not talk about Peru, Colombia,  You will not tell me you love me today, or that I feel like home to you, But what does it matter? I do not live in New Mexico, And I have no story to tell, Perhaps I will not even hear you  say my name again, You are probably with someone else, kissing her as you couple her face with both of your hands, Your eyes look at her  Your eyes see only her                         ~If love is love, then tonight I have to believe, believe for instance,  that New Mexico watermelon sunsets  and the twilight of the back road to Taos will be ours.  Someone will hear  our Lab barking in the back of  of your vintage truck. Someone will shush us in the movie theater, There will be inside jokes, bike rides in Mexico, squabbling over the words  of Mario Vargas Llosa, and thoughts on Shakespeare's depths, There will be innocuous lies--  covering your loss of hair, my weight gain, your white bell bottoms, my cooking, There will be long nights  filled with swollen kisses-- And a morning will come  It must be so,  You will fold your arms  around my waist,  hide your face in my hair and say, 'You smell just like a good cup of coffee!'    "
"   When I was in the fourth grade at Pleasant View Elementary, I had a teacher who must have understood my love for words and imagination.  It was a 'PERRRFECCT A!', on 'The Giant vacuum Cleaner,' I mean REALLY GIANT, that took over our beach city.  Mr. Fletcher, a kindred soul, might have been even slightly amused that all our brave heroine had to do was simply pull the plug. With strength like Wonder Woman, she gave a yank to the cord, ending forever all that mass destruction of mass-sucking and mass-thrashing...  Indeed, everyone was happy in the end.  The sun set peaceably on Bolsa Chica Beach once more...   How I loved and understood the power of literature in the fourth grade!  No, I'm not sure that we read poetry at school then, but I know I was getting it from somewhere... Both my mother and father had an affinity for language, poetry, music, art, dancing! Nonetheless, in the fourth grade, it was my story, and it was a very good story, and it made me happy!   How fiction enchanted my little forth grade life, and fifth grade, and so on and so on... Fiction, make believe, imagined words and power, happy la-la land of fiction; I get it now in present 34 year old College instructor terms--fiction, like what didn't happen to me this week, but 'What Should Have Happened:'  K--called me at 7:30 on Wednesday. His words were kind, and deep. He asks about my day, and then we settle on a place for dinner.   We sit in the patio of the restaurant going beyond, lost in Neruda,  lost in VanGogh, lost even in each other. Kisses and touches. Awkward pauses!  I go to his house, and he  hides my beige, hush puppy mules  under his bed...  A long awaited night begins, and when we wake up, he says, 'Stay, stay, stay!'  Ah, yes, 'What Should Have Happened' is just as ficticious as the Wonder Girl following the cord of the intrepid machine to save her city with a tug! But to the contrary, had the enchanting K story really happened, been de-fictionalized, it should have made me just absolutely happy and content!   But really, I'm not unhappy right now.  I love my life too much for that.  I'm just disappointed and disillusioned and slightly depressed. And literally, I've shared my grand illusion of K here, about what should have been.  Now for the truth to illustrate the grand disparity, the making of disillusionment.  I called him at 7:30, and he did not return my call. After waiting and hour or so, I called once more being that I had to get the info, for the mutual. I had no choice but to call.  We all have deadlines.  He was the usual cold, rude, cantankerous! Out of self preservation I said, 'You throw barbs when I speak to you.' He didn't say a thing. I said, 'I do feel sorry for you.'  or something to that effect... I was too tired. He was tired. He gave me the muted data/info, and then partially hung up... 'I will talk to you later/good bye' Breathe--I couldn't  BREATHE!!! & then, The mutual talked to him the next day--Thursday... He got nothing out of it, so the mutual called me to try and figure.  The mutual explains, that for some reason, he feels, 'I, JumbledChaos, am a threat to K, but K denies it...' I call K to straighten this mess out.  He's unpliable, and yet simultaneously shifting information from the night before. Yes, even paradoxical!  I maintain my professionalism; he jokes and says, 'Since we have a special relationship,' adding 'just kidding...' I say clearly and realistically, 'No, not especially, since you hung up on me last night...'  And then I'm feeling it, slightly agitated, so I say, 'just leave me a message when you look at what the mutual gives you. I am more than curious since I did work with him on this for several days...' K says, 'Ok...' I end the conversation gracefully.    Of course, I don't really expect a message from him.  He doesn't know how to show courtesy; he doesn't know how to care.  Caring would be for the K in the fiction piece. But then again, I didn't answer the phone yesterday, nor check the messages. I just didn't want to talk to anyone or to him; I wanted space, distance, air, silence, dust and sand, wind, anything to fill this gap between us--anything, but his voice, presence, being!       But V called this morning to say, 'I just wanted to make sure you were out of bed, and that you hadn't gone and cut your hair, put on black, and sold all your clothes...'   Ah yes, dramatically so, but in that instance, it was EB! I had been made suddenly alive! Love, that fire storm between us, rolled the enormous boulder away, and EB called forth to my depths, and I like a feminine Lazarus, did rise, rise from that frigid, dusty and lonely sepulcher! Really, had any woman, in her right mind, experienced the amazing and beautiful EB for the two years, four months and twenty three days that I did, it would have been blasphemous not to mourn for one's life!   I never knew that Love could be like that--never! I swear I thought I had been reading WAY too much poetry, but then it did happen to me! Both V and H--remind me that it happened. And H--always remembers that he called me, 'My chickadee...' How cute is that!!! And when I need a memory boost, H--tells about the time that we went to hear William Jefferson Clinton speak.  How, EB, was just dancing next to me; and how tight we were in the crowd...  I remember feeling EB's long arms, on my arms! Just now, I smell the coffee on his breath, and feel how his skin felt on my skin! Sticky, steamy, sweet.  I am so glad that I have the best two best friends on the entire planet! I'm so glad that they do remember EB, and all his good fruit in my life; because otherwise, I would be thinking that I had imagined it, more fiction, or that it was a grand hallucination, like that guy in the movie, 'A Beautiful Mind!' Ok, so at least this way I know that EB, did, really happen to me, and that I'm not as neurotic and crazy as I feel.    And yet still that was so very long ago; I know as Neruda says, 'We of that time are no longer the same...'  But looking back to EB always brings me great comfort--solace. I know I will love again, and I know how to love because I loved EB.  And stupid game players like K really mean nothing!  EB is the diamond and K is the foil!  Like in Hamlet where he's comparing his father (the former king) to his uncle (the new king): 'This Hyperion to a Satyr.' After a week of unwanted drama and evocative fiction, I understand, and feel that comparison today: EB, my great Hyperion, to this pathetic K, just a satyr--indeed!     Jumbled Chaos    "
"   What is wrong with me?  Now I seriously think I've lost it!  Why do I let him screw with me? My tactic for today was supposed to be evasive!  E-V-A-S-I-V-E!!     Screw it!  At the request, or rather insistence of our mutual piece of work, I called him. MR, was worried about some work that he had done for him; I had to call him!  I had no choice! Narcissistic, the guy is Narcissistic! So I try to be friendly; mind you, did he not just have dinner with me a week ago?  Did I just not talk to him LAST MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDS, and did he not just call me on Thursday?  And he can't remember my voice???  Ok, I was calling from the cell, and yes I have a freaking cold, but still... He didn't know who I was???? A complete blank???  He told me that our mutual cannot rely on me for help, and that it was nothing that I did wrong... I didn't think I had done anything wrong! I should have said, K--'You know, if you don't try to belittle me or insult me it will be a first!  In fact, every time I talk with you, you have something really crappy and demeaning to say!' Oh, But what the hell is his problem?   I shall not ascend to his greatness no doubt--the enlighend one indeed!  Ah, he really troubles me; he works me all up for nothing! I feel like crying over this complete ASSHOLE!  He's not even worth my tears!  Ok, back the phone coversation; So the mutual is stressing out in the back ground while I'm talking on the phone.  So I say, 'I'll call you tomorrow... What time is good for you?'  He gives tons of explanations, and lets not forget how my phone call would interfere with his damn swimming... 'I have to go swimming...' Does he want me to be proud of him because he goes swimming?  Like his stupid, long and lanky body could use the muscle building!    Nevertheless, I said, '7:30.' He said, 'I have my daughter..' What difference does that make?  We're not going to have phone sex!  I said 'I don't want to leave a message...' He said, '7:30 that should work...'  Did he not suggest to me on weds of last week that I might call him for next week for this very reason?  And now it is a little game?  Jumbled Chaos indeed!  He's putting me on the rack!  I don't feel my age.  I feel like a sixth grader. And the worst part about it is that I know he doesn't care if I call him or not.  This man delights not in me! All of this TRAUMA he is putting me through, and it doesn't touch him one way or another...  How does one live his life like that?  Just absoultely numb to the vivacity around him? I don't get how he could be absoultely numb to this passionate, youthful, feminine, sexy, creation fluttering around him! Don't get me wrong, I'm not flaunting myself; I haven't sat on his lap.  I haven't been agressive.  But I have been simply me, and that energy I carry with me is undeniable.  I know my own strengths!   Usually, I am so noticed... Not that I look for it, but it is just always there.  He's working me up to no end.  I don't want to talk to him anymore!  But in this instance I had to for the sake of the mutual.  It was a mutual intervention if you will... I have to talk to him tomorrow, and I'm going to be BOTHERED all day about it!  But K--he's probably not even worrying either way...  I feel like telling him: 'You know, I don't expect you to remember my voice... It doesn't sound like yours!'  No narcissus, it doesn't sound like yours!  He's conceited.   I'm not competing with him. I hate competition!  I'm not a game player. He's got a chip on his shoulder.  And maybe that's where I feel sorry for him.  'Pathos' he said at dinner.  I don't want people to feel 'Pathos for me'... Well, I DO feel sorry for him!   I can't help it!  He's stuck on himself.  He's got a cold and rotten temperament.  He's selfish, and dark!  He doesn't know what he wants; he's on a search. And when your searching for what you dont know, you end up with what you don't want...   'Oh, I am Fortune's Fool!'  You know when EB, beautiful EB, exited my life, I told him, 'I am never going to be this close to your lot Again.'  I meant it! I passed my education, away from the like.  And with K, it is the same thing.  I am never, ever, going to be in contact with the like! You see, maybe I have this wierd twisted fetish for men like this?   And here I go, breaking everything down, analyzing it, for NOTHING!!! I am happy. I love my life.  I just don't speak his language. I said that to him too. 'I don't speak your language,' and he spoke to me in Thai, so I spoke back to him in French!    He has to compensate for his cantankerous personality through this illusion of good looks!  I saw his picture tonight; the mutual showed it to me.  I just looked at him, and I saw a very old man!  In the sense that e.e. cummings writes; 'When men insist they are always right, then they are old.'  I can't touch that; I can't break through that!       I don't want to either!  I just wish he wasn't getting to me; he's in me, in my gut, in my heart, and all over me like skin! Skin--Dammit!    Jumbled Chaos "
"   The drama continues... J-called me twice yesterday!  He left one of the messages in French.  You see, he gets me!  But K!  K is just K!  Not a call, nor a word!  I have to address our mutual piece of work this afternoon.  I'm leaning towards evasion.    Why am I not attracted to J? & What is wrong with me? And K, who does he think he is?  Right--like he has it all going for him! He's temperamental...  Difficult, very difficult!  And arrogant as hell! Not to mention the fact that he's nine years older than me. H--said last week, 'You know, You had a very good relationship with your father; I don't know why you are so attracted to older men.'  We had a nice strong laugh about that. K is nothing like my father!  It's crazy.  I feel crazy; nutty!  He's making me absolutely crazy!  I should be grounded in my thoughts and feelings, but this guy is undoing me!  I should just say, 'You know, perhaps we should talk about the correct form of past participles--in bed!'  Or 'You know, maybe we can debate the problematics of Melville, and Moby Dick in bed.'  or better yet, 'I think we can put the practicality of appositional phrases better, beneath the sheets, in bed!'    Ah! I don't want to hear or to feel his twisted grammar theories anymore! I am on fire! I am not calling him!  Jumbled Chaos... "
"   I talked to J-- today!  He is so nice and normal--not neurotic like K--!  He made me laugh.  He's very, very cute! And, he makes me feel like a brilliant, young woman. But dammit, he's NOT K!    Yes, Yes, I'm officially pining!  What the hell is my problem?  I get asked out nearly every day, and K--is immune to me.  How odd that feels to be immune to someone. I don't feel like ice, nor even cool water.  I feel like a piece of dry and brittle wood.  A long hard piece of wood that you would find in the back yard; maybe, an extra piece of fencing that you had forgotten about. But all the same it is there fading from that deep red fence color to sun blanched.  There are these little holes all about it, and on one side, it's still moist and wet from where it rests in the dirt.  I taste the moist earth in my mouth today!  I'm getting a cold too; maybe I'm love sick?  I don't know, but nonetheless, I just don't feel good today. I had to shut off the radio.  U-2, 'All I want is you,' was making me think, and feel WAY too much!  I'm not calling him!  Even if I have a problem with our little sweet situation, I'm not doing it.  We'll both have to figure it out for ourselves! I am a game to him, or a joke... And I don't want to be his amusement!  Since I didn't sleep too well last night, I sat up in the dark thinking about how quick K was to correct my speech!  What a polarity from EB!  I remembered how I suddenly got stupid around EB, and he was always so gracious.  He would get stupid too; we could barely remember what we were reading at the time.  LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA!!! How prophetic indeed!  But still, EB would have said, 'Oh, don't worry about how you speak; I get you!'  He'd look into my eyes, and it was just clear and simple; My eyes against his eyes--a mirror!    But K!  I can never tell; it seems at times he looks at me as if he is hungry, or in search of something, and then more than often it is just a look like something you would smell in a circle k or seven eleven.  He looks at me causally as if one were deciding which pair of white socks to wear for the day...  And how I look at him?  I suppose it is a long simple glance that says, 'If you only knew...' Or maybe one that says, 'Touch me!'  Ok well, now I see I'm sounding incredibly ridiculous and pining away too!    I've got to go... Jumbled Chaos "
"    I've wanted to do this for a while, but I didn't have time.  My last class was Tuesday and I'll have to get the grades in next week.  So for today, I have a little time to breathe.  I'm pissed-off! K--pisses me off! I haven't spoke with him since Thursday, and I'm not talking to him anymore!  I just don't get it; I'm baffled.  You would think being 34 years old, I would have figured out, or at least somewhat deciphered the male species, but still I am a rebel without a clue!     Maybe men are like copy machines. I know that I am copy machine inept; my students beg me to let someone else make the copies because they don't want to read upside down essays...  Ah, what's the problem?    K--said that he thought I might be a bit too 'FLOWERY' with my students!  What the hell! So I'm just supposed to let my students throw what ever they want at me, and then pass them?  No!  It's not going to happen... But what does it matter? He's going to Thailand, or Tibet, or Laos for five weeks or so.  We went out to dinner on Wednesday night, and you wouldn't have thought we live in a desert. He is cold and arrogant and cruel and moody and selfish and so very ugly--well, maybe not that ugly... Yet for all that, I'm so attracted to him!  I can't believe it!  I never wanted to be one of those women attracted to a complete megalomaniac, but here I am.    I'm not calling him anymore.  I just so, so, so want him out of my system.  He's dangerous for my psyche! I am so not used to this; you know, I'm the one who is always doted upon.  He called me Thursday; I missed his call.  So I called him while I was driving home.  We talked about the tasks at hand, and then I told him, 'I just want you to know I'm not attracted to you--I'm not. That's what I was trying to say to you last night after dinner.' And yes, I am such a LIAR!  Hah!  But he just pissed me off! He didn't say anything. He didn't even try to kiss me after dinner.  He gave me this strange hug.  I was looking at his hands for a moment; I was wondering what they would feel like in my mouth, on my body...     I'm not supposed to be this emotional at 34.  My life is supposed to be relatively calm.  It is!  I am very happy with who I am.  I love my life.  I love my house. I love my family and my dear friends. I love all my shoes!  But K--is making me crazy!  He's going away for five weeks, he said.  But that sometime in the middle of July, he would call me, so I could come look at his garden.  I don't want to see his stupid garden!  I told V-- that 'I would go and see it, and that I'd bring my new husband and new baby and we would all walk through the sunflowers together...'  V-- said,'Don't you think it is going to be a little HARD to get married and have a baby in five weeks?'  Indeed, but that's besides the point!  I told him, 'I'm not calling you because everything is about control with you.  You are controllfull.' Yes I have a masters degree in English, and I couldn't add the proper ending to the word! He caught it.  'You mean controlling,' he said.  Yes, exactly, I suddenly get dumb when I'm talking with you.  But I do think that controlfull would be a great adjective! He does want to be the one who is full or consumed with control! It doesn't really matter to me anyway; I'm not talking to him anymore!   I wouldn't have cared if K--were going on vacation... I'm always happy to hear when people are going.  Hell, I'm happy when I go!  But just the way he told me... It was like he was saying, 'I go travel to exotic places; I'm the only one...'  I said, 'I might not be here when you get back. I'm going to Paris.' I wasn't lying. I just don't have to brag that I go every year.   He doesn't like me.  That is the whole problem.  I've never had that happen to me before, and that's strange! I've never lacked for an interesting man in my life, but this one, just doesn't seem to like me! He doesn't like my hair, or my smile, or my body, or brain, and probably not even the sound of my voice!  Oh, my vanity!  Vanity and Vexation--indeed!   Back to the phone conversation on Thursday... I was telling him to 'be safe' in his travels... We were talking for barely three or four minutes, and he said, 'I have a cramp in my neck.'  I can't believe how cold he is!  I just went into heart shock.  It's like he is intent on being shrewd and cruel to me. I have never known a guy who is so positively indifferent. It is like he's absolutely numb as to what he says to me. Yet, Wednesday, he was a little bothered by the fact that I said 'I'm not calling you.'  He insisted that I call before he left so we could discuss a situation... And when I do call, he tells me he's got a 'Cramp in his neck...' ?? What the hell is my problem?    You know, it's not the cramp in his neck that bothers me just now... It's the stick! This, 'I want you, but I don't want you... I like you, but I don't like you...,'Attitude!  I don't have time for his games!  I feel today that K--is such a waste of time!  He is a waste of time! Waste! I don't want to fix a man, or save one... I just can't go there!  That's what he said to me last Sunday, 'Oh, your going to try to fix me...'  I said, 'NO, I don't have time, and I don't want to fix anyone!'  Hello, I'm the jewel here!  I know this!  I love my life.  I love to laugh, and if he doesn't speak my language then screw it!    I suppose I just need to stop being attracted to these egotistical, semi-tortured artist types... I sometimes think I must have an invisible neon sign that reads: CREATIVE, POETIC, ARTISTIC MEGALOMANIAC WELCOME HERE!   Yesterday just thinking about K--and his b.s. made me cry a little.  And I don't even know why!  Really, he's nothing to cry over.  He certainly is no EB!  EB was my friend, my love, and you K are no EB!  Hah!  Well maybe that's it then.  Nobody not even the rain is as beautiful as EB!  His beautiful blue eyes, his lovely man-legs, his man-voice, his man hands! Oh my God--his very long, encompassing, lingering  glances! Now that, I could cry over--again, and again!  V kept saying, 'Don't worry, K, is just a jerk! He doesn't get you like EB!  Remember EB, how he just got you!  He loved your hair, your smile, even your clothes... 'Violets, Violets,nice dress!, he said'' And then V and I talked about how glorious EB was and is!  V said, 'I never even met EB, and I'm in love with him!' Indeed, ''Certainty like that comes only once in a lifetime...'' And the fact that he is married now, and lives so very far away is good thing for both of us!  I can't show up at his house naked, and he can't rock my world from this little corner!   But I suppose I've learned a good healthy lesson from lost love.  I'll know when the right Casanova comes along, he will be something like EB, but the timing will be right.   We will speak the same language, and instead of giving me strange hugs, we'll be discussing grammar and Shakespeare, and Moby Dick--maybe even, Gabriel Garcia Marquez under the covers at dawn...  We'll redeem the time! Yeah, I like that thought!  To hell with you K!  Jumbled Chaos              "
"   Love and war are the same thing, and stratagems and policy are as allowable in the one as in the other.  —Miguel  De Cervantes        Don Quixote  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel...   —William Shakespeare   Sonnet 131    C. Guests .  To prevent emotional turbulence, it is best that  all visitors, welcomed and uninvited , obtain proper clearance. Whether a best friend, classmate, or sociology professor arrives at your lunch table, he or she must adhere to the following protocol:    1. Video tapes will not be permitted in or around the eating area.   Should your sociology professor appear rather excitedly, but uninvited, and produce a video called, “Mama Coca” about the cocaine trade in Colombia, and explain rather loudly while pulling up a chair next to you, “I got it just for you; we are going to watch it in class today,” you might want to shun eye contact with your host while taking the video in hand and expressing your deepest thanks.     If you happen to glance towards your host, do disregard the tempered look, and slight flush to his cheeks.   He hasn’t been feeling well lately, and when the two of you are alone once more he will explain rather pungently, “there’s probably something wrong with my body today...”   But your host’s illness is no cause for alarm, for soon he will be the perfect picture of health when he arrives at the very next luncheon with a former classmate.  After handing her a tray in the gourmet food line, he will turn to you while you are gathering your own tray and inquire like a true host, “So, is Dr. Sociology going to be joining us today?”  You will simply say, “I don’t know.  I didn’t invite him, but he keeps showing up.” To which he will reply: “Well, you are so popular...”     2. All clothing matching personality is prohibited.   When wearing a dress covered in violets, or stylish overalls with flowers printed about, do not discuss poetry, Latin America, or your astronomy class in the presence of your host or uninvited Sociology professor.  Even if the astronomy exam is making you feel somewhat apprehensive, refrain from verbally expressing your anxiety.    Your host may conclude that he would love to see you write an essay in astronomy such as, “If the stars were French...”  Your sociology professor will then concede, “Yeah, look at her clothes—Flower POWER!”  And once more your sociology professor who both you and your host call in secret, “Dr. Sociology,” will state at the top of his lungs, while waving his fist in the air “FLOWER POWER!”  At this point, you may find it somewhat comforting to look at your host’s eyes, for indeed, although he is the catalyst of the embarrassment, he does now seem to regret instigating the said banter.  He will project his, “Ok, so this guy is a little over the top” look, head turned slightly to the left, blue eyes open wide and bulging.       3.  Any direct reference to, or discussion of that word—-LOVE is inadmissible.    When your Sociology professor arrives at your table, once more uninvited, and pulls up a char next to you, proclaiming,“I’m in love,” you want to try and transfer the conversation to a more acceptable subject matter.   Should the conversation go awry; do explain gracefully that you are familiar with the notion of being in love, although you find it somewhat difficult at times.     If your sociology professor identifies the kind of love you are defining as, “A kind of selfish love, where the two of you are not thinking about consequences, but rather lost in your passions,” it is best to keep your head in an upright position.  Do remember to blink and to breathe normally when he continues: “Secret love is hard; any love where you can’t express your feelings is hard; you want the other person, but you just can’t tell them.” Also, you might want to consider implementing  the critical contingency plan: cease and desist from any gazing, glancing, or peeking at your host —-bleeding revelations can be fatal. And for the love of God, think twice before you utter, “Well, I think love like that sucks!”     4. Flirting with either your host or hostess is strictly prohibited . For security reasons,  a zero tolerance policy  is in effect for all flirtatious activity—except between the host and hostess, of course.  In order to prevent the following conversation which could occur the day after you’ve asked your uninvited sociology professor to tell you about his trip to Cuba via Mexico,  the ban on guest flirting will be strictly enforced :    Hostess: (enthusiastically) Hi, how are you today!  Host: You were nice to Dr. Sociology yesterday.    Hostess: Yes, I was.    Host: You’re cruel!   Hostess: No, I’m not. I’m nice; I’m always nice.    Host: No, you’re cruel.   Hostess: I’M NICE    Host: No you’re cruel!    Hostess: I am nice!    Host: Keep saying it; you’ll believe it!   Hostess: Why then, am I cruel?    Host: Because, you’re just a mean, mean, cruel person!   Hostess: Maybe I should sit by myself today; I feel like I’m bothering you...  Host: No, you’re not bothering me—yet!    It is important to note that even before you could sit down and properly greet your host, the first words out of his mouth seem indicative of a severe breech in security.  Likewise, you too might find yourself in a threatening scenario come the end of a luncheon:   Former classmate: I just love your little voice. Don’t you (to host) just love her little voice? (large smile)  Hostess: Thank you. I liked reading your short story.   Former classmate: (insincere) Why, thank you for letting the two of us sit with you for lunch.   Hostess: No problem.  Host: (to hostess) So, are you ready to scram?  Former classmate: (to host) So, what is the name of that Mexican liquor made from cactus? You really are so funny with all your great stories to tell...  Hostess: (ignoring former classmate) Yeah, but I’m a little slow at packing up today...  Former classmate: That’s ok, we’ll leave without you!    Therefore: Any guests attempting to flatter, lick/lock lips, gaze, flip hair, or invoke excessive,infectious cheer/beckon the undivided attention of either the host or hostess shall be immediately removed from the cafeteria premises.    For extra protection, you should eschew the following discussion which is likely to occur a day or two after you’ve eaten with the former classmate and your uninvited sociology professor:     Host: Well, where is Dr. Sociology today?   Hostess: I’m not sure; I have his class last. I was wondering about Ms. Former Classmate...   Have you seen her today?   Host:  I don’t know where she is.  Hostess: What time is it?  Host: I’m sure Dr. Sociology will show; he’s always right on time!   Finally, as an added security precaution and thereby avoiding any future allegation of “Death eyes,” all luncheons here after will be held at the back table of the secluded  STAFF ONLY  patio—-rain or shine: for all your lunching pleasure, the patio is conveniently and remotely located behind the retractable wall on the cafeteria’s west side.    Remember : The patio Luncheon begins at noon, and relax, don't be shy if you aren't exactly staff; after all, as your host has sugested,'it ought to keep you away from Dr. Sociology...'     Next--Etiquette: the art of flirting  "
"   “Love is not a fire to be shut up in a soul. Everything betrays us: voice, silence, eyes; half-covered fires burn all the brighter.” --Jean Racine  Orestes, in Andromache  “Speak low if you speak love.” --William Shakespeare Much Ado About Nothing    B. conversation.   Before ordering that perfect speech pattern for your next luncheon, it is helpful to note that communication styles may vary.  Your host for example, prefers two of the trendier patterns.     Pattern one : an opaque and semi-detached style. But still, it is very user friendly and durable enough for daily wear.  He relies on this mode of conversation for everyone—everyone except you, of course.     Pattern two : a more translucent, flowery style rich with sensuous adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Equipped with specialized volume, tone, and intimacy control, this pattern allows easy access to all comfort zones.   Pattern  two  can be especially effective when discussing close friends, and “poetry, music, beaches, and dancing.”        It is best to keep in mind that  pattern two  is just for you alone, and is subject to change. If your best friend has unintentionally snubbed the two of you for lunch, he might suggest in a very soft and slow voice, “We should tell her that I packed a picnic, a picnic of.......of fresh fruits...........a baguette.......a bottle of wine......and some cheese...”  Never mind the fact, that your best friend does not drink wine, nor does she have a strong preference for the very romantic foundations of French cuisine.  As usual take the necessary precautions: hands free of all sharp objects, and air passages clear.  Also, you might want to avoid his extended gaze after the word, “fruits,” should your lips begin to quiver. As an extra precaution, place one hand directly over your mouth and turn your face slightly to the left, focusing on the NO SMOKING sign located on the back wall.  Should your best friend arrive at the next luncheon, and he happens to tell her, “last week I planned a picnic,” with a smile meant for you, do not be alarmed when the traditional French food transforms into “Just goodies.”  Certainly, your best friend already knows what he said to you last week, but a true friend is curious if he will, in fact, reveal the contents of the picnic once more.  After pressing him with a suggestion of, “Chicken or??”  He will simply reply, “Just goodies. I wanted to bring goodies,” while looking at you intently. Under such circumstances, you may forget to wonder what happened to the fruit, cheese, wine and bread.    If your host finds himself in a tight situation, where he must make a rapid shift from  pattern two  back to  pattern one , he should be able to do so with relative ease. While the two of you are discussing your reading of Mario Vargas Llosa’s, “The Secret Life of Alejandro Mayta,” and you happen to reveal that you do not exactly care for the author’s style, but you find his vivid description of Peru’s beaches, and mountain towns quite stirring, you can expect your host's immediate proposal of “I’d like to teach a class like that, you know, on Latin American music, poetry, beaches and dancing,” to be equally arousing.  Be sure to smile, agree, and insist on being in the class so as to reach full dotage capacity.   But should your sociology professor abruptly interrupt the conversation as an uninvited guest, he will make the switch rather gracefully when he explains, “I was just telling her that I need to teach a class on Latin American culture...”  Again, while he is speaking, expect his eyes to remain solely on you and through you as if he is all too familiar with the very corridors of your soul.  However, be mindful that you are now in the presence of unsolicited company; try to remove all excess of red from your face, and do cool down with a sip of tea or diet Pepsi before turning to greet your guest. After all, you don’t want your sociology professor thinking “History is your favorite subject.”             And always remember: “Speak low if you speak love...”               Next--guests: guess who is coming to lunch?   "
"                   Duke. And what 's her history?             Vio. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,                 But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,                Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,                 And with a green and yellow melancholy                She sat like patience on a monument,                Smiling at grief. --William Shakespeare   Twelfth Night          'It was inevitable: The scent of bitter almonds always  reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.'                     --Gabriel Garcia Marquez          Love in the Time of Cholera   It happens with food.     Lesson One  At lunch: If a little hungry while waiting for your best friend to be through with her psychology class, and an all too familiar face finds you out side a dull college cafeteria, be sure to sit with him after he persuades you to 'try the gourmet food line.'  You will find his proposal on secluded patio dining quite intimate.  The first time will not be the last.     A. appetizer and drinks .   After you are seated, it is possible that you may have trouble with your hands; if you do not know where to place them as he tells you about a dream he had of Trotsky, try running your fingers through your hair.  Or, you may want to pick at the cherry tomato in your salad as he inquires about your weekend; when telling him, “so much can happen in two days,” to avoid all choking hazards, be sure to swallow the tomato bit before he replies, “So much can happen in twenty minutes.”     On  cold days , rely on your Styrofoam cup filled with hot constant comment tea should you find his lingering glance too intense.  You should be able to sustain any emotional fall out while shifting your eyes from his eyes to the white cup.  To avoid biting down at the cup’s edge, lick your lips, smile, and employ your infectious cheer.    On  warm days , it is best to chew the crushed ice in your tea when an awkward pause occurs.  Remember, this too shall pass; soon, he will put you at ease and on edge as he suggests more exotic, moist, places for vacation such as a stroll through the Amazon Jungle where serious allergic reactions to beautifully flowering plants are not uncommon, or maybe a little R& R in a café in Ecuador, smoking and drinking with friends.    And when the need arises for an extended vacation, such as a vow to be out of the country during a presidential inauguration, you will find his pitch for a trek through Mexico more than advantageous.  After all, cycle tours in Europe are all too common, and it is much better to be an 'Anarchist at heart.'  But if in the mood for places closer to home, he may recommend an airy walk on San Diego’s infamous Black’s beach, or because you have an affinity for flowers, you might prefer a little visit to the Anza Borrego desert, or Joshua Tree being that “the blossoms will be extremely beautiful from all of the rain.”    Or perhaps even better, a trip to New Orleans, since you are French, and would really enjoy the 'Franco-Spanish influence,' and the dark smoky bars awakened by the Jazz festival. Certainly, one of the many used bookstores might permit you to rescue a real keeper—an old copy of Neruda’s, “Twenty love songs and a song of despair.” Knowing that this poet is new to you, and you just love Neruda, he might even lend it to you; well, that is 'if you can be nice,' and if, he remembers to bring it.             Still if there is an absence of cash flow and time, you might give serious thought to his preference for “The back road to Taos.”  Indeed, the direct route is certainly less romantic and less interesting when traveling with the wrong person.    But if it is just a setting sun you are after, you don't have far to go. After expressing how you “love the view of the volcanoes on the west side of Albuquerque,” he will not hesitate to inform you of his frequent rides up to the volcanoes, where he enjoys 'sitting there, seeing the pink, peach, and pale blue sky, while watching the sun go down.'  When hearing his romantic sunset phrasing, avoid all fidgeting with clothes, and earrings.  Also, take caution: if holding a drink, you are prone to spill it on your salad which you have barely eaten, or on your dress.   Under no circumstances, get ahead of yourself; this is only the beginning.  For there are still many discourses on sunsets to come, and as he will assert again and again, “There’s nothing wrong with flirting...”    Tomorrow--Now You're Talking: Proper Lunch conversation.   "

If you want to know what I'm like, wait until we're in a tunnel, and then study my reflection in the window.' - from p. 108 of _Flaubert's Parrot_ by Julian Barnes  Love is a butterfly left with one wing and that wing is on fire.

"       Finished Pelevin's _Buddha's Little Finger_ (Viking, 1999) on Jan. 9. Want to know about men in white hats... Writing the book 'American Fiction.' January 7, 2004 The man with a hat.  Name for the novel: “American Psycho” or since it has been already taken “American Fiction” Just yesterday, I came across a ladybug, rusty winter colored pouring over the floor. I counted eight spots on its back and set it on a plant leaf to match the green. In a dream, the villagers spoke of water. Their faces were all scratched, as if a demon had handed them to the crow’s beak. Outside, the wind was fierce: the snow dusted along all the streets, fairy dust, blocking out the view of the town hall, a palace at night. The snow was light and hunger struck the meekest. A rising sun stroked the surface of the eyes of their leader, blue in the mirror, green in the forest. He was of pure mind and he catered to a ballet dancer. She danced for him, in her white shimmer, every night before dinner and even before breakfast, her muscles taut with hate. He would tie a green satin ribbon around her waist and a black choker around her neck. He liked to call her his Degas. There were sunny days that winter. Fireflies found a way of sighing at night in memory of summer. Birds rushed by windows, glinting like rainbows, tulip colored, intelligent. As he walked to the station, the investigation began. She paced the courtyard with Rachmaninov at her ears –one swan to each ear, killing it.  In the park, they met like strangers. She pretended to recognize him. He read her his collection of atrocious poems and wandered into the bushes to pee. Liquid poured from him in bitter strokes. He did not love her, but he craved her touch. He was lying to her, lacing ribbons round her wrist. The sound of angels laughing and Robert Frost's devil made him tremble and trembling leads to laughing. You have killed me, she sighed. He denied and went on his way.         "
"       And as she stood over the bed, lantern in hand, the stranger appeared. His eyes were green with red lines instead of pupils and he wore a bright blue satin tie with white starched shirt and no blazer. His pants were silver: as if they were made of the wrapping paper you get for a wedding anniversary gift. He did not speak for a what seemed like a few moments. Every moment creaked. The wonder of it all. She had cleaned up all her books, sorted out all her creams and bandaids, washed every dish, dried every tear, but now she knew why she hadn't done it earlier: didn't she need that emergency suitcase: oh G-d help me so that I may never need help from others. The dizziness was tremendous. Emergency suitcase. Her heart did palpitate. nothing: a friend betraying. Nothing: it did not matter, was all perception. Nothing mattered. It was so funny because the saddest things were funny. Love was a guttural disease. Love was measured in dollar bills. Love was a nonety. of all clouds: that was the New Haven cloud. dark, misty, brilliant, silver on the outside. delirious, she leapt on her bed, longing to break it. All the drink, all the glamour, the breathy voice, the shimmery lipstick, where was the pain if not hidden--raw raw raw the weather--the world was on edge, and the dance had just begun. She would keep on writing.          "

Byatt, page 2  'This just made me very angry, because it seemed to me that life was so varied and complex that it took up all your energy, and yours would never be the same as anybody else's description unless you were a bad writer. The only definition I give of how I know a novel is bad is: one, if it's derivative, totally derivative; and two, if the sentences are limp. I can't think of any other.   The nice thing about a novel is that everything can go into it, because if you've got the skill between sentence and sentence, you can change genre, you can change focus, you can change the way the reader reads.

She read the entire book and could not find the lines. Then she noticed a little editor's note at the very end, saying James had taken the title from his short story of the same name. She got a complete collection of James's stories and found the quotation on the next to last page.   'We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have,' it read.

"        urlLink Yale University > 2004 Commencement > Baccalaureate Address   Richard H. Brodhead, Dean of Yale College Baccalaureate Address Woolsey Hall May 23, 2004 Some Words on Outcomes as You Go Out  President Levin and I entered upon our current positions on the same day eleven years ago. At our ten previous baccalaureates, I, an English professor, have read literary passages to graduates as they go forward. For those same ten years, Richard Levin, a professor of Economics, has felt the gnawing pangs of passage envy, aching to escape the rigors of the dismal science for the pleasures of literature. This year, in an academic transvestitism seldom before witnessed, I have magnanimously allowed President Levin to wear the glory robes of poetry. Encourage the boy: didn't he do well?  Actually, what I just said was false. Here is the truth. I myself will be going out with the Class of 2004. I too came to Yale College expecting to spend four years; but through a decimal point placement error only recently detected, I instead spent forty. In recognition of my belated departure, President Levin has invited me to give the speech that he usually gives at the Baccalaureate. That is real magnanimity, and I thank him most sincerely. Is there life after Yale? I admit that it's a novel concept. But as with the traces of water recently found on Mars, the signs are newly encouraging.  Friends of '04, I note that you are dressed in black. Why the gloom? I suppose I know. You are dressed in mourning for the fact that your revels are all ended, and the life and friendships formed here about to dissolve. Four years ago, when we last gathered in this room, your college years seemed to stretch infinitely far before you. Well, infinity does not last as long as it used to, for here you are already, with only few grains remaining to pass through the hourglass before your college life is done.   Or might I guess that for some, your suits of woe bespeak a deeper gloom? At a freshman assembly some years back, I had the experience, like a bad dentist, of jabbing a nerve straight on. On that occasion I told of students who had confided that they thought they has been admitted to Yale by mistake. As I said this, at least eight hundred freshmen gasped as if I had divined their inmost secret. It's thrilling for a speaker to wield such power - so with a sadism unbecoming to a dean, the dentist will venture another probe.  As for the robes of gloom: could it be that one or more of you have arrived at the end of your ride here with your future plans still a perfect blank? Might there be some who have plans but know deep down that what you've signed up for is a perfect figleaf, marginally covering and only temporarily postponing exposure of your scandalous nakedness of real life plans? Haunted by this uncertainty, might there be one or more of you who have had twinges of feeling that - as the Yale Precision Marching Band chants to opposing goalies in Ingalls Rink - It's All Your Fault: all Yale's fault for having failed to provide you with a single marketable skill? If students in the room have not yet felt this, there may be some in the upper balconies who have, or will. Some while back I met a woman in Southern California (I name no names) who revealed that she had not one but two Yalie sons who had come back home after graduation to a new life, not quite what she expected, of getting up late, eating bizarre amounts of cereal, and watching reruns on TV; and who, when pressed about what they might want to go out and do, glared the unspoken words: Don't Go There.  If anyone in this room resonates to this description, I have a message for you: it's going to be all right. Is it any wonder if the end of college should produce a pause before you find the onward way? For the great majority of you, the end of college marks the end of a far longer stretch (for some it began in the days after birth) in which your life has been defined by the fact that you were in school. Since kindergarten or preschool, school was where you spent the day. School was the answer to the question what you were doing with your life. (Remember the convenience of this? Question: what are you doing with your life? Answer: I'm still in school.) A succession of schools set you your annual tasks and challenges. And school said what came next - more school, of course: after fifth grade, sixth; after high school, college.   Now, for the first time, you are about to step out of that structured life into the abyss of the undetermined. No wonder if it's disorienting - what else would it be? But another name for life unstructured in advance is freedom, and other words for the life lived in that territory are independence, maturity, and adulthood. Welcome to them. Will it be beyond your power to orient yourself in that world, find your way in it and make something good of it? In bad moments it may seem so; but think back to your arrival here. When you came ashore at your last terra incognita, you may have felt at a loss, but then something kicked in - some mix of courage, spirit, curiosity, and desire - that helped you go forward to meet this unknown place, engage its challenges, and make it your own.   Do I doubt that the same thing will happen again when you leave here? I do not; you've done little these last four years to make me think of you as helpless or resourceless. I saw the mother from California recently, and when I asked about her sons, I learned not only that they had gone on to absorbing and fulfilling things but that she had no recollection of their homebound or deadbeat stage. The early modern philosopher Bacon wrote: ' they are ill discoverers who think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea.' So with you: the solid land of a good life is out there for you, however little you can discern its shape or shores. Courage: the strengths that brought you this far will bring you to it yet. And when you find it, you'll learn that you've carried all kinds of valuable things forward from this place, however little they may be visible as assets now.   In recent years there has been much discussion in this country about the need to identify goals and measure outcomes in education. I do not wholly disagree with this mode of thinking as it applies to elementary education. In our world, the cost of allowing young kids to move forward without having mastered fundamental skills is simply too high. But I am much more skeptical about outcomes-based theories as they apply to the kind of education you have received. What we have put you through here has involved some element of marking things to be learned, making you learn them, then measuring to see if you did in fact learn them. But that did not yield what was most worth getting here.   One limit of the outcomes concept of education is that it treats acquisitions as fixed that can prove in fact quite transient. Every one of you has mastered complex subject fields sufficiently to display that knowledge on cue on a final exam only to have it begin seeping from your brain soon thereafter. By a conservative estimate, the things members of the Class of 2004 collectively learned in Yale courses that you have already forgotten is probably equal to the sum of human knowledge gained since the early Renaissance. Parents shocked at this statement are welcome to come onstage, where I will subject you to a public quiz on Ohm's law, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the workings of the passive subjunctive future tense, or other outcomes you once reached to great applause before relapsing into the contented ignorance of today.   Such inevitable forgetting is not a scandal in education because the original act of learning taught something more deeply valuable and left a deeper trace: trained deep habits of mind that survive the specific content that was originally attached to them and can then be put to a different use. When the Duke of Wellington said that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, he did not mean, I think, that organized sport consciously or purposely taught the arts of war. He meant that deep skills learned at hazard in one world, that of play - skills like physical courage, working together in teams, coordinating strategies over space and time in a way that requires continual improvisation and revision in face of changing circumstances - these skills turned out, in ways wholly unforeseeable at the time of their acquisition, to serve a second function, equipping a later self to act in a context radically different from the one where the skills were learned.   In an office I was given the use of at Duke a few weeks ago someone had posted this saying from Ruskin: 'The highest reward of a person's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes through it.' That comes closer to my own philosophy of education, since to my mind, the real outcome to aspire to is the building of the self - a process that does not lend itself to authoritative measure because it is never over and because its ways are oblique. Whatever we pretended course by course and week by week, what Yale really required was that you use its challenges and resources to develop your latent powers and build the more capable you. If you can't yet say what what you learned here is good for, that's because you are not yet in the place where it will show its value and help. The fruits of the deeper education only reveal themselves in time, as a life's and history's emerging challenges - like the Napoleonic Wars unforeseen in the youth of Wellington - call forth their stores of strength.   Could I be more specific about the equipment I see you carrying forward, possibly unbeknownst to yourselves? Men and women of the Class of 2004, you have done a lot of homework. There are 1300 of you and you each took 36 courses running for twelve and one half weeks. Equipped with these facts, I tried to estimate how many books you have collectively read, papers and lab reports you have written, and problem sets you have worked, but my brain got tired before I got the answer. I congratulate you on your colossal diligence, but now that it's behind you, it might be safe to reveal a secret. The point of all that homework was not for you to complete it, but rather, through this exercise, to develop powers that can only show their value when the days of assigned work are past.   In my life I've met people who seemed absolutely to have stopped thinking at a certain point, and to be living on a stock of frozen opinions as limited and antiquated as their aging wardrobes. I cannot promise that this will not happen to you, but I pray that it won't, and if you escape this fate, the work you did here will have helped protect you against it. With luck, years of artificial school exercises will have developed an instinctive drive to keep identifying and assimilating new sources of information and subjecting them analysis and synthesis - dispositions now sufficiently rooted in your nature that they can carry on without external or institutional support. So internalized, the habits that made you a good student in early life can begin to make you something more interesting and more important: an ongoing student of your world and a constructive contributor to its needs.  At Yale academic education never takes place by itself, however, but in energizing interaction with a certain social environment. We've provided you with a thousand classmates, like you in skill and thoughtfulness but bizarrely various in their origins, outlooks, commitments and beliefs, to live with in intimate community and daily exchange. It's my profound hope that the form of sociability you have become accustomed these last four years will prove habit-forming as well, and that you will seek and recreate this sociability on your own when an institution ceases to provide it for you.   As you know, the Brown v. Board of Education decision ending court-legitimated school segregation was handed down fifty years ago this week. But for all the changes it has made, this country is far from having solved the problems of social separation and inequality. It will be for your generation to make progress on these fronts, unless, which God forbid, you fail to make that progress. The role of the well educated here is not altogether reassuring, since as much as any group, the well educated have tended to live and work in enclaves with those who are comparably privileged. Hard to see how that isolation will be of much help with problems of which, nevertheless, all will suffer the consequences. But perhaps the battle for an inclusive society of equal rights and mutual respect will turn out to have been won - or if not won, in some measure advanced - on the intramural playing fields of Yale or in the rooms of Vanderbilt or Bingham or the dining halls of Silliman or TD, scenes of interactions and understandings won across social divides. I have always regarded the intellectual cost of separationism to be as great in its way as its social cost. In this country, those who have stopped thinking are typically those who have stopped interacting with people who might make them think - people, namely, who do not already think more or less the same as they do. With luck you will seek the educating differences others shun, without necessarily remembering where you formed that taste.  Last let me say a word about the idea of service. A loveable feature of this school is its culture of other-directedness, the generosity with which you regard your gifts as existing not for yourself alone, but also for the good of others. I've seen you, unknown to your teachers and for no conceivable credit, working with neighborhood kids in sports camps, or giving music or health lessons or making science cool in local schools; I know of your efforts in this and other countries on behalf of the sick, the poor, the uneducated and the displaced; I know what you have done within these walls to make this community's life more interesting and more rewarding. When college's somewhat artificial world of organized activity dissolves behind you, as it will, I trust it will leave a seed in place for future growth, the habit of using your intelligence to enrich the lives of others. Numbers of you will go to work in teaching, in community health, in environmental causes, and in government service, and I praise you, but those are not the only ways this start could be extended. The world needs every known profession (well, almost every); and in every profession there is a way of practicing that is small-minded and self-serving and another that serves the larger good. Whatever you do, I look to you to make that difference: the best legacy you could take from Yale.  Men and Women of the Class of 2004, you leave here for the valley of uncertainty also known as life. If that brings anxiety, it also brings opportunity, the chance to make a life - and you will. A poet in your class whose words I prophesy you will soon be hearing - David Goren, Trumbull '04 - has written these lines, spoken as to a graduating senior by a soon-to-be-former beloved named Ivy:  I confess, I've grown attached to you -  But now we both have other walls to climb. Growing is something you'll be doing As long as you live, and you should learn to do it elsewhere than the paradise I made for you, imperfect as it was. He's right. You came here, you saw, and you overcame. You grew into this place, you grew up here, and you grew strong here. Now it's time to break its bounds to win room to grow some more. If Yale wanted anything for you, it was to nourish and confirm your will to grow, growth that will continue though we must leave, now, to allow it to continue.  Do you understand me? I think you do. All right then: Let's get out of here.            "

I would like to cradle you and softly sing, be your companion while you sleep or wake. I would like to be the only person in the house who knew: the night outside was cold. And would like to listen to you and outside to the world and to the woods.  The clocks are striking, calling to each other, and one can see right to the edge of time. Outside the house a strange man is afoot and a strange dog barks, wakened from his sleep. Beyond that there is silence.  My eyes rest upon your face wide-open; and they hold you gently, letting you go when something in the dark begins to move.         "

She walked the streets in search of a cheap predictably sexy dress for a wedding she might not attend. Micki--that name he had used over and over again, his dear friend. Well, had she ever been given the chance to see his translucence, his vibrations and defiance? No--his name was Micki. He had hid behind his fake dick.  In the corner of her white bathroom, a spider quivered. She shot herself an unsteady look in the mirror, realizing he would not call her again.  When it came time to scrub her teeth, she felt the wetness on the top of her thumb. The spider had hid away and she searched the gray sky and brick from her dirt framed window. Nothing.  She could still go to sleep and wake up tomorrow.  There was a quiet sniffle from across the way. Perhaps her neighbor was reading on the porch, getting ready to recreate.   Give me incense as charity, she thought. Give me anything but that stale smell of a weed tower memory--she and R taking that joint and fulfilling R's fantasy of doing it high.   Why does every man have a fantasy he can describe so mercilessly? You've satisfied that one, they say. Or will you satisfy this one? Who will, the next? I won't be there.  The light went on in the room across her window. A fat framed figure appeared and sat, face blocked by the screen. Often, she would walk nude into her bathroom.   She cupped water to spit out toothpaste and any other stupid thing she had not eaten.  She would not try to open her mouth tomorrow. Those catatonic patients had taught her how to break up desire.

"                 July 30, 2004 Because I could, I started my sentence with because and had a child called Marcia. She looked like Elvis in the good days and never spoke a bad word to Mamma. I treated her like a princess and made sure she had strawberry bubble-baths every frigging day. She was older than me in no time and loved to tell me stories about her sexual conquests. I would just sit back and listen to her winding voice meander through the convolutions of my alcohol soaked brain, in awe of her beauty of both mind and body. I must confess, whenever she moved, I found myself looking at her, obsessed with her blond ringlets shining in both the rain and the sun. She was my only baby and she treated me sweetly. I didn’t feel in any way inconvenienced by her desires and fell asleep soundly each night she stayed at home. When she was four, she left home to conquer the big wide world with her big blue eyes. She would write to me from Paris, then from Rome, then from London, and so on and so forth about meeting famous people in the business. She learned everything from the Can-Can to the Rachmaninov 3 during her travels: she was professional in everything she did. Although she never did return home to Blueville, she remained my fervent admirer and would sign her letters with an effusive flourish of both penmanship and wording: “I love you, Darling. Send my regards to your whole body, your Marcia Baby.” She wrote me once from Switzerland, from some spa— I’ve forgotten it’s name—where she was staying with a beautiful banker of the dark flavored variety, that she had given up chocolate for good and was playing the violin as well as Paganini would have if he had been blessed with six fingers on his left hand...

I feel as if i'm losing my faith in the watch towers...England: 'chronic alcoholics, godless..'

Of course, when youre dead, you pass the time beautifully. If feels as if someone hit me in the head with a sledge hammer.  In the dream I was about to go to IDMs concert and then I realized I should fix my hair and use the bathroom. For some reason, I thought the bathroom was outside the concert hall. I go out again into this deserted street in New York City. It happens to be quite cold outside and windy. Perhaps we are in Autumn--is it November? And as I walk out, I see no one on the street---this deserted street, except the man I saw before, a tall dark figure waiting in a light beige trench coat near a lamppost with a heavy long black rolled-up umbrella. I notice him looking straight at me and then I realize it is finished for me. He runs towards me and it is clear he is wearing a black mask over his face. It is also clear that he is about to lunge at me with his heavy black umbrella--to impale me. I cry out: No, please dont kill me. Take my body instead. He does not speak but motions with his hand, stopping in his tracks, at which point five or six muscular men in tight white T-shirts encircle me. I know what they will do and I cannot look at them. I cannot feel anything but nausea sweeping over and through me. I cannot even swallow. Then, more women appear seemingly in the same position as me, with muscular men surrounding them, ready to take their bodies and do what they will with them. I know that rape is not the only activitythey will try to kill us as well. But to be raped over and overdoes that not amount to death? To pass the time Somehow, light is added to the image and I find myself still prostrated in front of the men who watch over us, but now on grass. I cannot remember their conversation  but I remember thinking, as their banter heats up, that I can escape. I run so fast I cannot see, right back into the reappearing buildingthe light is almost the light of the fire and I see IDM. I slink underneath a table, trembling, but still he catches my eye, as he sits up front, overseeing the show. At the endthere were only five minutes left of some jazzy music with three girls in gaudy costumes doing some sort of Can-Can inspired danceI run to him and crouch in a corner, hiding. I think he puts his hand over my head as I hunch over in a feral attitude, in a rabbit's stance, not knowing how to breathe. He is wearing blue and his face is dissolving into his glasses and mouth. I do not remember what happens next and then I wake up.   I grope my way out my dream. The rest of the day is spent determining how much I shouldnt eat and... Then, I get the alarm about my fever and I cannot do anything but fall into bed. I rule out the fact that I have taken in too much German wine.

(or am i hallucinating?)--it said on her crimpled piece of paper): she sounded completely confused. 1-514 or not, i got rid of her. she was cute, though. did i say that before? long blond hair, slim, and confused. then, as i entered Eaton Center, this East Asian dude, who was wandering around with his white friend, apologized to me like five times for running into to me, in an American accent. what a tactic! he didn't even run into me--it was some old man who got it... anyway, he asked me where to cut his hair...he said somewhere on this floor...yeah, same place i was going. when i started walking quickly, he was like: 'why do women have to walk so fast? please slow down.' he was a trip. so, at the salon where i might get hiv, hepatitis and a host of other diseases, all of the four Vietnamese women were busy working on Caucasian, African Canadian, French Canadian, Arabic, Italian, Jewish nails. It was a real multicultural scene. Haha. Then, i met Nadia. A new one. We talked only in French. She kept asking me what color she should use on her mile long fake nails (hands, not feet.) She was really cute with her almond brown eyes, tan skin with a pink glow on her cheeks (or was that make-up), great bra or..., came from St. Eustache, told me she was 20 and dating this hot Lebanese guy who only wanted to marry a virgin (a problem in both our cases, hah) and wanted her to look great 24/7. She also admitted that she never saw him without her blue contact lenses. She was like, I think i look ugly without them. Can you help me? I was about to say, go tell this guy to fuck himself. She said he was driving her up the walls. No joke? He had forbid her to wear mini skirts, but she admitted that he ogled all the mini-skirted shiksas on St. C.. She was like, never date a Lebanese who is Muslim. I was going to say--you don't have to worry, but why lie? ;) I'd be great with my virginal spirit... Anyway, what can you do but be a slave--or use a whip? When she left, we kissed the Montreal way (her idea) and she said: see you next time. How many times do I go...?

I first would like to tell you that I really appreciated our meeting and I think my parents were delighted too to see you. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed your trip in Europe.   As far as I am concerned, I left a few weeks after we met to Scotlant to visit some other cousins I've never seen before and  I went then to Roma with some friends. Both of these trips were great.  I met many people and I saw a lot of beautiful places I've never seen before.    Then, at the end of June, I've started in Paris my one-year internship in the financial department of a big French company. Even if it's sometimes exhausting  I find it really exciting and quite interesting. And besides, as I now live in the centre of Paris, I can benefit from all the assets of the city. And at the moment, it's very pleasant to live here especially because Paris is totally empty in August.   Otherwise, what are you doing during this summer? What are your plans? Next year you'll start law studies at Mc Gill, won't you? How is Nathan?   I really would like to see you again so if one day, you plan to come to France, just tell it to me so that we meet up again. And don't forget that you're really welcome to come and stay at my place.   I'm very much looking forward to hearing from you.

And Mary, after all the pain is gone, I'm always going to live to be your man.' (from the Scissor Sisters' 'Mary')  ...i'm very much looking forward to hearing from you...       "

The right reader of a good poem can tell the moment it strikes him that he has taken an immortal wound--that he will never get over it. That is to say, permanence in poetry, as in love, is perceived instantly. It hasn't to await the test of time.

"       OK, sorry for abandoning all of you out there wondering hOWL in the hell I'm going to work nights when: a. I don't really want to work nights. b. My life happens when the lights are on. c. I don't want to work nights.  I can sympathize with you because I feel the same way. When life (your job) demands a nocturnal existence you have to adapt. Thus, these suggestions that have worked for me:  a. If you have a night shift coming up, the evening before on your last day off, go to bed at your usual time, maybe a little later and sleep for 1 to 3 hours. Get up, drink coffee and or tea and stay up for 6 or more hours. Go back to bed and sleep for 6 or more hours. When you get up you are more or less ready to stay up all night.  b. When you go to sleep in the am. for your daylight sleep think about doing the following:   Take Melatonin and or Valerian before you hit the bed. Melatonin 2 mg. to 6 mg. (for adults) depending on your sensitivity, is a natural hormone produced in your pineal gland that influences your daily rhythm's and sleep cycle. That is, it makes you drowsy. It is also an antioxidant (good for you) and most people find it has no side affects. You can get it at most grocery stores and vitamin shops. Read the instructions. Valerian is an herb that has been used for centuries to help folks get drowsy before bed. It comes in 400-500 mg. capsules and I find it more sedating that Melatonin. BTW, it stinks. It has a funky odor but once it is down the hatch it is very helpful in smoothing out the melon so it can sleep. As in all vitamins and herbs or medicines, read the instructions.  Use heavy curtains or shades over your bedroom windows so very little light gets in your sleeping area. Light has a way of waking you up more easily during the daytime than darkness. It also interferes with time shifting which is predicated on fooling your body into thinking it is sleeping at night.   More on this later. What did you expect, a 15 page term paper? =B^o        "
"        OK, what is time shifting? It is the key to transition from the world of the day walkers to the night life and back again. You would think I would tell you about it now but truth is, its time for me to become unconscious.       Pardon the tease, it is not intentional. I will be back with some suggestions that do work.   In the mean time think and read up on Melatonin and I'll be back with my time proven technique to alter your waking and sleeping rhythms.            "

I'll try this out for a few days or weeks and see if I will be a satisfied customer (well, unpaying customer,that is).  === i love that i was able to  sleep  from 2am to 2pm last 'night'.  I miss that I can sleep for 10-12 hours a night!  Eversince I started working again, I still haven't gotten used to sleeping early.  My body clock really dictates that I sleep at around 2am.  But then, that would mean that I only get around 5-6 hrs of sleep if I want to arrive on time for work.  For some people, that would be more than enough but if I really listen to my body, ideally the amount of sleep i need is 10 hours.  That would mean I won't be cranky the whole day, I'd have enough oxygen in my brain to afford to go jogging at the end of my workday, my skin will not be breaking out with zits or what-have-yous, and i can survive the day without having to go on a food  and diet coke binge.

"       My name is Greg and this is my story. After you read this, you'll understand why everybody thinks I'm a big, fat loser. I grew up in Pacifica surfing on the beach with my ten foot woody at the tender age of five.Shaka Brah!! Once I got bumped by a great white!!!But I fought it off with a piece of drift wood nearby. I then moved to Hayward. And shortly after I went on a hunting trip with my father and I got struck by lighting but don't ask my mom about it because shes' too traumatized to speak about it. Damn that hurt!! I have had a lot of interesting jobs since then. While I was attending Tennyson High School I drove a hurse. I would like to think of it as a morbidly fascinating job.I became temporarily unemployed. Perhaps it was because of my late night mung jumping fetish.I then became a bouncer in San Francisco but the gay men kept beating me up.So I finally figured I had enough of the exotic jobs and I put in an application at my local Radio Shack.But that turned out to be worse because of all the fighting in the store. I beat up more people there then I did working at the club in San Francisco.All of the stress at the Radio Shack job made my heart problems get worse and I had to jab a heart needle into my chest with my last ounce of strength.And then!!!And no more and then!!!Since I wasn't picking up any hot babes at the local Radio Shack I decided to quit my job and start batting for the other team. I guess all those gay clubs rubbed me the right way.I met this really tall dark and handsome boy with a stubbly chin named Orlando. That summer we kissed and I knew at that moment I had made the transition from a boy to man hood. As he fondled my supple man breasts on the grassy knoll, I knew he was Mr. Right. Just as I was about to reach Home Base (hee hee), my dad called to tell me to take out the trash. Due to my homophobic father, I could no longer see Orlando and I had to settle for a green dildo and a large container of vaseline.  During the summer, I took a trip to Reno for Hot August Nights. I rode a Harley along with some of my friends, who also took their bikes. You wouldn't believe how many hot chicks couldn't get enough of me! I have had a couple of jobs since then but my freak accidents always land me back into enemployment.One day I met the perfect girl she looked like me, she smelled like me, and she also could never keep a job like me.What a coincidence she had the same freak accidents as me.Its twelve 'o' clock i love you the most im in love with you most and you're the cutest.Im in love so much that my dick is glowing like a glaze donut.And beacuse I live with my parents I will never have to work again.This is great they even said they would buy me a house in Woodchuck.

"        the doctor told me to get some ice and sit with foot up. i knew peter (my mgr.) wasn't going to take this well. i got a note from the doctor (for peter) and an appointment to return in 2 weeks to check my progress. i wasn't supposed to work for that 2 weeks. i was living paycheck to paycheck at this point. our store was floundering so i wasn't getting enough hours to live on as it was! good thing about working for a corporation is the benefits. i applied for short term disability (S.T.D.) right away since it takes some time and  tons  of paperwork. i was still waiting to hear on that when it was time to go back to the doctor.    if i had a penny for every time someone asked me '  how  did you do this again?' i would have more pennies than i could easily carry around. i wish i had a much better story of how this happened. i even tried to pass one off . the problem with it was anyone who knew me would start laughing after my opening sentence. here, let me show you. 'so i was in this one night stand...' i told you before i'm a terrible liar.   when i went back to the doctor he couldn't belief my lack of progress. he asked 'the question' at least twice and sent me away with a slip to get another x-ray and a referral to an orthopedic surgeon. he also gave me another note for peter extending my time off for another month. he wanted to get me into P.T. but felt we needed to do more healing first.   before i was to see the othro doc he referred me to radiology for an M.R.I.. the purpose of a M.R.I is to look for signs of muscular and bone damage a regular x-ray wouldn't show. i know you are all wondering so i will just say yes. each person i saw in the progression of healthcare providers asked 'the question' in near disbelief. the more time that passed it took on a comical quality.   by the time i saw othro doc it had been about a month since that fateful day. he wanted to get me back on both legs and back to work so he had me fitted for a walking cast. he gave the okay for P.T and wanted to see me in a month. things were getting back to normal or so i thought. work rejected my walking cast for safety and health code reasons. CRAP!! i couldn't return to work until i could do so without my cast.   thankfully around this time my S.T.D. kicked in and i could pay rent. lots of phone time and paperwork involved but i'm thankful i had this. it didn't pay the amount i was used to but it was something!   my life as i was used to it changed drastically from that day forward. being the independent gal i am suddenly needing to rely on others for simple things was hard. some can give testimonials that i would borderline on difficult at times. hard to believe i know. :) since then i have had to change the way i do things and give up some things i really enjoy. it's okay 'cause i'm still standing- just differently.

"        as i already said i had a  blast  monday night! one of the reasons was the fact that people seemed to put their personal conflicts aside and came together for the evening. i know when you have a small diverse group not everybody is going to get along all of the time. especially when there is a lot of overlap in their time together. so thank you all for a great evening. i for one needed a night of merriment with people i enjoy and am i comfortable with.    i know i didn't do the promised song but i had my peter brady on! i can safely say that was allergy induced. not sure at this point what could be new or stronger to add to the allergies other than the layer of smog we are getting. one day soon i shall grab that mic and shock you all! in the meantime i keep dodging singing games in shows but would do it if was called for. good or bad sing loudly and proudly. :)   i know i promised details of the evening but in remembering a great evening to those who weren't there can sometimes make it sound sorted. for those who were there nothing that happened was new or different for that gathering. so i shall just leave it at that   i look forward to one day doing karaoke in the bay area with mike and marissa. hopefully one or both will come back to visit and sing. i'm hoping sam will do the same too! you are all missed.

"        on march 29th 2004 at 10  : 45 in the morning i was walking home from work. it was a beautiful spring day and i was looking forward to a walk through a big park near by for exercise . i was also taking my camera along in hopes of some cherry blossom shots. work had been uncomfortable but that day i rocked and was in a great mood. i was going over what i needed to gather to get going. there were a couple of cars waiting at the stop sign so i decided to walk a bit closer to my building before i crossed the street. i was almost across from the front door so i went to cross between two cars. they were parked close together so when i stepped down off the curb i stepped on the edge of a hole i didn't see. i  so  didn't expect that. i went down fast and hard. as it was happening i knew i had really messed up. the bag containing my cd player, some cd's, my journal and the small ceramic coffee cup i had just won as a prize went flying (and breaking) all over the street. It's a busy street so i tried in my pain amidst a string of profanity to retrieve my items. one attempt to move and i realized one of my worst fears had come true. the sole bread winner was down!   i have worked hard the last 3 years to be self sufficient. i have not gone out partying on the night before a early morning (early is 3:20am) at work. common sense i know but a lot of my co-workers do it regulary. i would resist buying that awesome pair of shoes that i would love to have but didn't need. i always made sure i had rent and bills covered before all else. Don't give me the sainthood quite yet. what i'm saying is there was nobody around to be my back up. (that's a whole set of stories i will eventually get to) i'm proud of the person i am and evolving into. i have always been and still am a responsible person. yea for me because i had paid the extra for health insurance. in the 1 1/2 years i worked there i never really needed it. some co-workers even had said i should cancel it so i would have extra spending money. i just felt better knowing if i needed it i had it. well i was gonna need it now!   the fire marshal was coming to do an inspection of the sprinkler system in my building. he was freaked out watching me go down and putting sailors everywhere to shame with my string of profanity at a increased volume . he gathered my items and helped me hop to my building. once inside i took it from there and got to my apt. my right knee was bleeding pretty good and i had to get my shoe and sock off while i still could. i was in a lot of pain so i allowed myself a few minutes of crying then i called work to ask if the next person to get off would take me...... wait... where  do  i go? i had no clue since i never had an emergency! i had to play corporate phone transfer til one lady told me my options. that burned up most of the hour i spent waiting for jasmine to show up.    she was new at my store and to portland so i didn't really know her very well. she used the spare keys i kept in my locker to get in my place. she got me advil and cleaned my knee up. she even helped me change out of my uniform! she and her husband drove me cross town to my doctors office. i told them they didn't have to wait for me. i was being fit in so who knew how long i would be. sara, my friend who lived next door, worked over that way and would be getting off about the time i'd probably be done.   the doctor asked me more than once ' how did you do this again?' after an exam and x-ray it was determined that i had severely sprained my ankle and had to stay off it for sometime. ouch.            "
"          i'm so glad i made the trip for karaoke because  i had a blast last night! the evening was filled with great music, awesome performances,  cock blocking, fruit flavored drinks, lots of laughter and good old fashion make out sessions. you really can't ask for more than that in one evening! i will get to a more detailed post later but i have to wrestle with the boys for the computer so it may be late tonight or tomorrow. stay tuned to marta's world if you dare. it's not for the faint of heart. :)            "
"        so the same friends i do improv with are also serious karaoke folks. they have play lists and go crazy at a new karaoke venue drooling on the song book. i don't want to call them karaoke snobs but they only do songs they know they can do well and  never  done in humor. i've always thought of karaoke as silly fun. Don't get me wrong, they have lots of fun and support each other but it can cause some performance anxiety to a newbie. i think i have an okay voice. i took choir in high school and sounded good with the other second sopranos.    never in the many months of hanging with these folks have i done a song. at first it was because i was catching up with people. i should mention that this happens in eugene not portland. i wasn't avoiding doing it but it just never happened. i think i did turn in a song once late in the evening but it was too late. then near the end of the walking cast phase of my recovery (yes, another story i will get to!) i had tonsillitis for almost 2 months! they actually threatened to remove them if i didn't get better! grrrr! i couldn't sing for awhile then i could do lower notes but not much else. it wasn't funny like the brady bunch episode when the kids formed a music group. they did it to win money to buy their parents an anniversary present. peters voice started to change a couple days before the contest so greg re-wrote his hit song to accommodate peters crackly voice.   i just sounded bad!    it's been 3 months and i have more of a range but still not great. honestly i think it's allergies more that a need to snip! if we transition into fall/winter and it's still a problem then i'll know. i don't have the lovely health insurance now so...i'll cross that bridge when i have to.   two of the gang moved to california late july. one of them has come back for a week to visit mommy and friends. i hope to make the trip so i can see her at monday night karaoke. she is entertaining and enthuiastic - fun to watch. they are both missed but she can shake it while cranking out a tune. not sure i can do this just now but i'm a crazy spontaneous gal. i might finally do a song such as it will sound. :)           "
"        i figure i should explain the title to this blog. like most things it's longer than one entry so bear with me. my writing style makes some people cringe but keep reading it might grow on you. if not no worries.   three years ago i had to make a hard decision that hurt people i loved. i had to start my life on my own for the first time. my support system (my family) that i thought would always be there withdrew. actually they believed my (then- now ex) husband. this was bizarre since i always tell the truth. i don't have it in me to lie and you can tell from my face if i am trying. i learned that as a small child. i was truly alone and confused. the person who had been a great friend stepped in and was my support. (this is the bigger painful lesson i learned) i felt that i was truly in the fight for my life. 'they' kept pushing and punching trying to knock me down and out. things got tough but no matter what (you got it) i was still standing. i went down on one knee more than once but something in me just kept me going. (BTW i used to box thus the fighting metaphors) Don't get out any kleenex because this isn't a sad story. i have had some tough times sure and i have learned some valuable things along the way. the most important things i learned is i'm a strong woman. more than that i learned to trust and believe in myself and like  me   . like any journey you make wrong turns and errors in judgment. i certainly made my share of mistakes and suffered from them but that is why i found the strength to be the awesome, hot, strong, funny and easy going gal i am today!    there is (as always) more to the story. in the coming posts it will all be revealed. after all, i'm an open book.           "
"         after waiting what seemed years but was really only 16 hours i finally get another turn! i love my boys dearly but they are computer nazi's! they don't get that from me. :) to be fair they aren't allowed to use the computer at their house but  come on!!  i'm done ranting for now.   there is so much that wants to come rushing out i don't know where to start! how about a glimpse into how i really do enjoy the simple things? let me start by giving you a bit of back round. i live in a urban apartment . i really enjoy where i am and it was a block from work . the building i live in is a funky old place with big windows, pocket doors and claw foot tubs. the downfall to this place is the apt. sizes available. most are single and double studios with one 1br and a couple 2 br. thrown in for fun. i was lucky enough to get one of the double studios on the corner so i have cross ventilation. mine is also one of the few that haven't been butchered to make it modern. it has been hellishly hot for a week or so making my world uncomfortable. (i dislike being too hot or cold) this morning i woke up to slightly over cast skies. it is cooler and strangely quiet for a saturday. after i started the coffee i moved the areo bed and got out my outdoor folding chair. (my oldest son was still asleep on the only place besides the bed to sit) as i sat down i had a happy feeling. something about the day and the chair reminded me of camping. i got a goofy smile on my face and basked in the good feeling. "
"         well, i'm not usually one to follow the sheep but in this case i did! it started out innocently enough by getting the site addresses of friends. i would look at their blogs and journals when i remembered to but i soon found myself logging on  just  to view their sites. in fact it got to be a self made frustration! logging on to view the latest and they didn't even have the courtesy to update! then wanting to post comments so i got a user name and  started  but didn't finish setting up a blog of my own. i wondered if people would really want to read my positive quirky outlook on life and could do so without getting sick? so it sat unfinished for a few days, really forgotten until , a friend 'traced' my user name to my 'in name only' blog. the comment that came out of the blue made me feel i was caught. i gave the lame excuse that i had never made my web page so ..... 'you should get on that' okay now i feel i gotta follow through on this since i went  that  far. (for those of you who don't know me i know just enough about computers to be dangerous.) it took me most of a day and TONS of calories burned from frustration! the first seven pages i set up were cool. the next several were okay and the final product is just what i made to get here. actually the page is just a page but cute and useful in it's own right. check it out if you want. that's all for now as two teens are nagging for their (god given) right for a  turn NOW ! welcome to my world.

"       Everyday I have political discussions (arguments) with people. I love talking about politics. I like knowing what is important to someone, and I love to hear someone's rationale behind voting for a given candidate. That being said, I am tired of the discussion revolving around Iraq and terrorism. Don't get me wrong, I think these are VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES, but they are not the only issues. The fact is whoever is elected will continue our 'War on Terror.' We cannot afford to stand by while there are  credible  threats to our country. I think John Kerry will work to step up US intelligence agencies, and I also think he will seek (and receive) international help in the rebuilding of Iraq. I am convinced that Dubya will be no better at handling these situations.  The first paper I wrote in college was about ending permanent MFN trade status with China. There are numerous reasons I supported this, but the most important reason was the government's history of human rights violations against their own people. I thought (and I still do) that we needed to send a message to China that we would not deal with a government which was abusive to its citizens. I tell you this to highlight my opinion on Iraq. Saddam Hussein was an evil man. I would agree that the Iraqi citizens will be better off in the long run. I have NO problem with us being the world police. I support US intervention in situations of mass genocide or political tyranny. BUT, that's not why we went to Iraq. We went there for WMDs and to settle a score with the guy who tried to kill GW's daddy. I truly believe this, and I won't argue the points. The story obviously changed when it appeared we would not find large stockpiles of weapons. I think the world (and Iraq) is safer without Saddam, but I don't think he was the most glaring threat to US safety. Despite what G-Dub and Dick Cheney have said ('No, I didn't say that...er...go fuck yourself!'), there is no proven link between Saddam and those responsible for 9/11 ( urlLink 9/11 Commission Report  pgs 61 &amp; 66).  I try to think back to March 2003, and I don't recall doubting that Saddam may have WMDs. I do recall thinking that we had troops in Afghanistan (Isn't it something like 10,000 troops v. the 140,000 in Iraq???) looking for bin Laden who to date has not been found. I could not fathom starting another war while we still had troops fighting in another country. Is it good strategy to fight a war on two fronts? I never thought Saddam was a credible threat, and I think the majority of Americans now agree. At the time a lot of people disagreed with me about my opinions. The fact is I love this country. I am a proud American. I support our troops. Those are facts about myself, and they are not issues I will debate. GW says, 'You're either with us or you're against us.' Although he was speaking about other countries, the undertone has been the same to anyone who does not support his war in Iraq. It's a sad day when you have to clarify that you support the troops even if you disagree with the president. If we are going to support our troops, let's not  urlLink reduce their combat pay . Let's not reduce the death benefit given to families of dead soldiers. Let's not  urlLink cut veterans benefits . Let's  urlLink provide full health coverage to Reservists and their families even when they're not on active duty . Just a thought. I support those things. Now you tell me I don't support our troops. Eat me.     "
"       I do not typically go out a lot. I will meet my friends for Happy Hour, and I go to the occasional BBW hotel party, but I rarely go to clubs or bars on the weekend. Anyway, I DID go out on Saturday night. We went to a place called Yorkshire Pub (West Little Work &amp; Barker Cypress) for Kristin's birthday party which was hosted by Nicole. Kristin and Nicole are both part of a  urlLink BBW group  I hang out with, and I think they are both really nice. There are some women in the group who I think are questionable, but I think Nicole and Kristin are great. Back to the subject- I ended up having a really good time. This place is a karaoke bar. I did everyone a favor, and I did not sing...unless you count singing in my chair without a mic. I drank a few too many Cape Cods, so I was a little more obnoxious than usual. I usually wouldn't talk about such an uneventful night, but there was something that bugs me. There was a guy, Josh, who was there for his sister's birthday, and they were sitting across the dance floor from us. I noticed him looking over at our table during the night. I didn't necessarily think he was looking at me because there were a lot of women at our table. Anyway, Angie and Lisa (Nicole's friends) went over and talked to him sometime during the night, and I guess he told them he thought I was pretty. They didn't mention this to me until later. Anyway, later in the night everyone was on the dance floor dancing, and I got dragged out there. I usually never dance. I am not sure what the problem is. I have pretty good rhythm, but I freeze when I am on the dance floor. I start doing the Elaine (Seinfeld), and I point my fingers and kick my feet. OK, I am not that bad, but it can get ugly. Also, I kept stepping off the sides of my shoes when I walked (Thank you, Cape Cods!), so I did not want to be out there. So, I am out there getting my ass slapped by some girl (don't ask), and I see Angie pull Josh out to the floor. I did my best to get away, but I was stuck with him. This guy was cute, and I choked up. I ended up leaving the dance floor to go get another drink. My hands were actually shaking. I have no idea why. I am not the nervous type, and getting approached by guys in a bar isn't a rare occurrence. Something about the scenario Saturday night freaked me out. I didn't talk to Josh at all that night. I did not give him my number, and he did not give me his. I guess what bugs me about this is that I don't know why I clammed up. I think a large part of it is being put in the situation. Had I talked to him before the dance floor incident, I would have probably stayed on the dance floor. If he had come up to me later in the night, I would have talked to him. Alas, I think my personal insecurities played into it as well. I am still not entirely comfortable being hit on. Most of the guys I have dated will say that I am not the easiest person to get to know. I question everyone's motives, and I trust no one. A lot of people have said I come off as a bitch or a snob (I certainly can be), but I am a pretty likable person once someone gets to know me...at least I think so. I don't know why I make it so difficult on myself. For the past year I have had no desire to date anyone. The last guy I 'dated' made me feel like absolute crap when it ended, so I realized I needed to focus on myself and not someone else. I have taken care of a lot of the things that needed changing a year ago. I feel like I finally have the time, energy and desire to invest some of myself in someone else. Still, I make excuses. I plan on moving back to Austin soon, so I don't want to get tied to someone here. That's just a reason to put off having to meet someone until I move. I am sure when I get to Austin I will just be too busy to date. I am not looking for marriage, but I would like someone to care about...and I would love the attention. :) So, Josh, if you read this, sorry I was an idiot. And since he won't be reading this, I guess putting this on the internet somehow makes me feel better about the situation. Blah.     "
"       I used to really enjoy my job.  I loved my boss (even for an Aggie), and I had great co-workers.  Sarah has been my rock the past 18 months.  I was pretty depressed when I moved back to Houston, and I don't know if I would have made it this long living with my parents if I hadn't had her to vent to on a daily basis.  Sarah is a very loyal person, and I am grateful that I have her in my life.  My other co-worker, Elizabeth, has been another source of strength for me.  She has provided me with great 'life' advice in the past 9 months.  She helps me keep a rational mind when I get upset about something.  She has also given me career advice that I think is invaluable.  Anyway, our work situation changed in April when we found out our boss, Shanubh, had been promoted to a management position in Austin.  Shanubh is happy in his new position, but he sounds pretty loaded down with work.  Sarah transferred to another office.  She currently works for a great guy, but I think she misses it here.  Elizabeth is currently working at two offices, and she is happy there.  That leads me to my newest co-worker, Rhonda. Rhonda is interesting.  She worked at another office where it's rumored that she was involved in a romantic relationship with the female agent there.  I have absolutely no problem with her being a lesbian (I think she is more of an Anne Heche), but I do think it's an interesting side note for any male readers.  Anyway, I hate working with Rhonda.  We get along on a personal level alright, but I have no respect for her work ethic.  She is lazy, and she has no desire to actually perform the duties of this job.  We don't have a hard job, but you do have to WORK.  That requires that you show up.  On average Rhonda has missed 1/2 a day each week since she started here May 1st.  I guess I would not have a problem with that if I was doing the same thing.  Also, she does not know how to do many of the tasks the job requires, and she will not ask me for help on learning to do them.  She is rude to customers, and she rarely follows up with them.  Finally, she does not have the required licenses or agreements with the company needed to perform work tasks.  I tell you this because I found out in mid-June that she MAKES MORE MONEY THAN ME.  I ended up meeting with my new boss about the situation, and I voiced my concerns.  It was one of my finest hours as far as work is concerned. :)  We worked out the pay issue, but she is still here.  I hate coming to work some days.  I feel like a sucker because she knows she does less work and she comes and goes at her leisure, and I can't do shit about it.  Fark that. I would like to stay with the company but not in this position.  I would like to move into management or development, but that may be down the road.  At that time, I doubt I will want to stay in the Insurance business anyway.     "
"         So...this is my first post. I want to write something interesting, but I am not good with that stuff under pressure. I have no idea who will read this, so I might as well fill it with stuff I may want to remember someday. For the record I am 24 (Aries). I live in Katy, Texas which is outside Houston. I grew up here, and I went to college in Austin at the   urlLink  University of Texas   . I was a Government and Philosophy major, but I have not finished school. I have about a year left, and I really do plan on returning to school. I will likely move back to Austin at the beginning of 2005. There are a few things in this world I am passionate about, so if you read more than one post, I will likely be talking about these things: my family,   urlLink  politics    and   urlLink  University of Texas sports   . I know there are other things in the world to be passionate about, but I choose to focus on these three things, and they keep me pretty occupied.     My family...I love them. My mom is the most important person in my life (rather or not she realizes it), so she affects my whole spectrum of emotions. We have a close relationship, but it has not always been that way. I love my mom dearly, but she is a pain in my ass, and she is also the source of most of my aggravations. Even so, I have no doubt about her love for me. I am fortunate to have all my family in Texas, so I get to see them regularly, and I have relatively close relationships with my cousins, etc. In my family you don't miss a family gathering because we will be talking about you if you aren't there. On the other hand, I am lucky to have a fun, laid back family. Most family parties take place in the kitchen around drinks and a bowl of queso. I have a family who likes to have a good time, and we usually always do. I am sure that I will talk about my family a lot on this thing. Some of the funniest things happen when my family is together.  My second passion is politics. I am a liberal. I have been for as long as I can remember. When I was in the 3rd grade I was the only person in my class who voted for Michael Dukakis in our mock election. I have no idea where my politics came from. I come from a family of Republicans. I get a lot of crap for it, but I realize that when it comes to politics, I believe in my heart what I believe in my head. That being said, I can never be wrong when I follow my conscience. I hope a lot of people feel that way about their social views. When I was in the second grade I wrote a paper about being President when I grow up, and that goal has never really change...but, I have become more practical. I don't want to rule the world, but I would like to work in politics. I always called myself a Democrat. I am further to the left than most Democrats, but I won't be voting for Ralph Nader anytime soon. GW and his goons scare the crap out of me, so I am willing to donate my time and money to getting him out of office. If you return or continue to read, you will see a lot about my political views, so I won't continue to ramble on the subject.  My final passion is Longhorn sports. I don't take bad mouthing or losses well. I have been known to cry after a loss (and a few beers). I am very superstitious. I have several shirts, pairs of underwear and hats I can no longer wear because I wore them during a loss. I once stood on the same tile in a kitchen for 3 quarters of a UT football game because my Horns got the lead back when I started standing there taking shots with a friend. I will lay down on the couch when the Horns have the ball and stand up when the Horns are on defense if I think it works. When I go to games, I am a bit more subtle, but I would lay down in the stands if I thought it would help the Horns win a game. Anyway, I am apprehensive about the start of the College Football season, and I am still licking my wounds after the loss at the CWS. Regardless, I bleed burnt orange.  You've just read more about me than I am sure you wanted to know. If you are still reading, get a hobby. Nothing I said above was very interesting, and I think you could have spent the last several minutes doing something more productive. That being said, I hope you come back and read again. :)         "

"   Much funny.  2 points.  As mentioned in the email, no game this week; I have to research a 13th century poem for a final paper.  I enjoy the work, but I'd much rather have swashbuckling adventure in wintery Hillsfar. "
"   Harpers, Harpers, everywhere.  Harpers, Harpers, they really care. Harpers, Harpers, stay in motion.  Harpers, Harpers, healing potions. Harpers, Harpers, pins of green.

"   In an earlier post, Johnathan said:   'And then: What of Gregory? Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein? ........ There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  "
"    I'd post this on the RTG Blog, but I can't post there. Could someone either post or e-mail me the resolution to the Catillian situation? As the original hook of our adventure, I'm kind of curious. Thanks.  # posted by IDIC : 10/23/2003 12:53:31 PM     Castillion  was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal. The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane. It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.   A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia. Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible. He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.   Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East. The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.   Also, Castillon is Ian's father.   Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character. The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such. Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.   # posted by Harmony : 10/23/2003 02:00:31 PM   "
"   The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna, the priestess who took over after Castillion departed. "
"   it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.  he seems like the type that just sprouted out of the ground. and if fc really is his father, then why didn't he claim him earlier?  who is his mother?   "
"   since our next game is the weekend of halloween, why don't we all dress up like our characters next session? "
"   - Hillsfar, ruled by Lord Malthiir, believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord, who came to power by unknown means.  - The Red Plumes, an army of mercenaries recently added to a pre-existing smaller force; news its victory over the most recent orc attack (of which there have been three so far in the region) is spreading, attracting more enlistees.  - The local Thieves' Guild, a member of which helped acquire the antidote for Ian and Rhanellus  - The Hand, a mysterious order of deadly monks and assassins  - K'Sh'Aal, a powerful unidentified figure who apparently pulls many strings; according to Luc, the name is reminiscent of those used by dragons - The Zhentarim, an order of sorcerers who actively seek power; rumor suggests that they are on the verge of an internal struggle  - The Harpers, a centuries-old secret society that seeks a way to restore Faerun  - Jalal, the Elven-designated watcher/keeper of Cormanthor  - Garovia, a recently-awakened corrupted Druid, whereabouts unknown  - Orcs, thousands of which live north of the Moonsea; the attack on Hillsfar is the third such action in the past year  - The Citadel of the Raven, a tower complex where resides Lividia, who has been linked to Rhanellus, the sacking of Shadowdale, keech (an addictive plant), the recent orc invasion, possible agents within the Red Plumes, and the foreign goblin machinists  - Lizard Folk, of which nothing is known except they attacked the party during the interrogation of a keech-addicted Red Plume guard   Plus various individual contacts the party has met or heard of.

"   Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.  Regardless, we missed you; hope your day was a good one.  Father Castillion has been found, and the end of the battle of Hillsfar was remembered, in which everyone earned an average of 2,000 xp, and a few leveled.  Also, Scott got some much needed rest. "
"   I don't know how long RTG will last. I don't see a reason to end it, as I am presently committed to gaming as a regular activity in my life.

"   and as far as characters go, i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.  i feel like i owe it to her.   "
"   and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.  i can't believe that powerful of a magic user wouldn't have a backup plan in case her body was destroyed. "
"   To be fair, Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or, rather, his/her/its representative).  Duellacathata just wanted Falchez dead and buried in his family's magically sealed tomb.  Or so she claimed.  Ashes, of course, tell no tales. "
"   i'm going to stick with Ian, for now.  but having the choice is quite cool.   welcome, scott!  glad you were able to get in this time.  let me know if you have any further trouble.  any chance we could just teleport to the dragon's graveyard, and then teleport back?  'cause *damn* it's a long way back south, in the opposite direction of everything else we want to see, even by way of the cave network previously mentioned...  after we find out about castillian, i say we:  - clear our names, expose the conspiracy, report the lizard men sighting - determine burne's fate - go destroy the keech fields and, maybe, lividia - find a big enough city where we can all train and otherwise increase our skills  not necessarily in that order, but close enough.  was the Hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current predicament, in regards to the murder we've been accused of?  can't *believe* that Zhenterem bitch killed that banker and framed us for the murder,  just so she could raise him from the dead to steal from his own deceased grandmother.  way to go, rhanellus!  burn baby burn...   "
"   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  "
"   Referring to Johnathan's post, I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.  This is fine, mind you, but needs pointing out none the less.  Personally, I just don't feel that Gregory has evolved enough within himself to be able to broaden the lens/scope for him.  He is still very much following his own set of goals.  Some of which are shared by other party members, such as finding Castillion, but like the majority of the party, he seems to have his own agenda.   "

In case you're curious: after pursuing various leads regarding both their recent memory loss and the murder they are suspected of committing, the party has made a curious and partially unexplained bargain with several Illithids, who promise to restore their memories -- an act which may resolve several questions, one of which being the location and activities of the missing Burne.

"   To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame, one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.  Whatever happens to the platoon, the story of WWII goes on, often dwarfing the individual soldier.  Perhaps the best one can hope for is to be present at Midway, or help raise the flag on Iwo Jima, or be the bombadier on the Enola Gay.  Regardless, there are two valid choices:  either to focus only on one's own mission and interests, or to expand that focus to include the scope and detail of the war in part or in its entirety.  What the player finds entertaining, rewarding, and manageable is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character.  Of course, in a party of seven characters, there are seven separate lists of what is relevant.  If one is to remain with a party and not go off on one's own -- which would be perfectly acceptable, except that it would result in leaving the game -- there is an argument to be made for being aware of what the other six individuals deem relevant to them.  Otherwise, one is watching choices without clear motivation, and the result can be a frustrating chaos.  Thus, the list of what one needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer.  And so on.  By the way, as a general note:  If any player starts to feel that his or her character *would*, at some point, decide that it's more logical to leave the party and pursue his or her own agenda, it is perfectly acceptable for the player to create another character that will join the party and take the previous character's place.  There's no rule that says you must stay with one character throughout.  Once provided with the player's basic guidelines/requests, I would NPC the character Somewhere Out In The World until such a time that the player wanted that character to return.  Alternately, the path of the absent character might later intersect with the party again, and for a time the player could play both until one left again (hopefully this would only be a session or two.)  Anway -- just a random thing to toss out there.  Even though it began as a simple mystery of What Happened to Father Castillion, the camera has pulled back far enough now that almost all the world is in play.  Thus my interest in launching some side games that occur elsewhere in the world's history.  This post, like many stories, seems to have grown with the telling.  I'll stop now.  "

"   ...but the spirit of the fellowship remains, so long as we hold true to the purpose of the one we sought and found.  Castillion's path is much like our own; he left his home with small but noble intent, but now walks a much longer road, towards a goal of global (cosmic?) significance.   "
"   Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge, the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.  Given the discovery made after the raid on Grieson's heavily protected auction, it is unclear if the party succeeded.    Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.    What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.

"           I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.  She was not attuned to the Force at that point, masking her from Vader.         "

"           i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.  the issues you are pointing out are due to inconsistency on the part of george lucas.   then again, one could argue why was obi-wan able to communicate with luke after his death but yoda wasn't? or why darth vader could sense luke but couldn't sense leia ? my point being is that there are no real answers to these questions - we could conjecture on what the answers are but none of these very valid points were addressed in the movies so we can only assume that it was lucas who was not paying attention to the details of his films.            "
"           something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'          "
"           the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper 'blogging' contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be 'several' years between e2 and e3, and then 'about 20' years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as 'infants' in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from 'actual' creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the 'C-3PO has switched heads with another robot' gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, 'look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          "

"           the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead 'boogey man' for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.          "
"           Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III:  1)  Who was Jango working for?  On one side, he was the basis for the clones.  On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the 'pha', what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.  Alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen.  It was more like riding a roller coaster (i.e. being on a track) than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling SUV.         "

"           i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one, there must be a reason why this desire for long-term bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures.  also, what is wrong with wanting stability in an ever-changing world?  yes, there are bad marriages that can ruin a person but in a healthy relationship where both people contribute,compromise, and share it can enhance your life tremendously.

"           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         "

Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the 'mainstream' workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.

"           Aparently, and I have no text to back this up, the report sent to the UN came from the EPA and not the White House - small but significant difference.  President Bush has reaffirmed his opposition to Kyoto (phew).  I am a little concerned that some lower level government official (Christine Todd Whitman at the highest) has the authority to send such a report, supposedly representing the view of the President, to the UN when the report does not agree with his opinion / policy.  In other words - what the hell is going on in DC?         "

"           Mir, you must be slipping.  I just heard that the Bush administration sent a report to the UN agreeing that global warming does exist and that humans are the likely cause for the warming.  On the flipside, they say there is nothing we can do about it and proposes no changes in fuel consumption and other generally expressed ideas for combatting this.  Talked about mixed signals.         "
"           I agree Mir, the man should not be tried.  They should have removed him from the speech site and barred him from reentry.  I don't know what the background of the speech was (i.e. was it a polotical fund raiser or a paid speech), but decorum demanded that the man allow others to hear what Bush was saying.  Once he broke that 'rule', he should have been removed, not arrested and charged with a crime.         "

"           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             "

"           I was over my brother's house changing the oil in my car. I learned that Nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brother's oil clamp would not grip. They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for 'listening'.         "

"           University of Connecticut physics professor Ronald Mallett, 57, said in April that after years of study, he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel, involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects. Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

There's the part of me that says if it were MY family member/spouse/lover/friend murdered so horribly, I would want swift, brutal, American-style justice.  But I don't really believe that.  I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, 'Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?'    Food for thought.

"           MadLib #1  Awake! Fear! Fire! Foes! Awake!   The night deepened. There came the soft sound of otters led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they quibbled, and twenty-ninelavender figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemurcapitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seatchafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.  At a second blow the window seat yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The lavender figures passed gleefully in.          "

"           When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'               "

"           I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.         "
"           I'd love to reread 'Lolita' after learning French.  Humbert has all of these thoughts and musings that I'm sure I'd find fascinating and tender were they in a language I knew.

I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.  These are people who use words like 'paradigm' in everyday conversation.  I personally find it boring.  I'd rather watch 'The Golden Girls.'         "

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html             "

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          "

"           There definitely are, but it's a question of 'filling in the gaps.' Sometmes I don't have enough work for a 40 hour week, while some weeks I put in 60+ hours. And the way I look at it, I need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two. Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.   But I won't even go into the hassle I face getting paid on time. Suffice to day, I just got a check for an article I work the beginning of June.

I finished the damn thing at 12:30, an hour late... sigh...  Yet, I'm not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenaline-driven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash. If I were able to do the thing in 2 hours, it'd be good money. But who can type over 50-55 words a min.  I mean really??  I need a nap, and I'm supposed to start another one at 2.  Must. Drink.

But then I guess just reporting the facts doesn't sell newspapers, enthrall television viewers, or attract Internet users to your website anymore.  I am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to Dr. Rajcoomar.  I really don't understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat.  But as for their reaction to the actions toward Mr. Feuer, what would you expect?  If they had asked him to calm down, pretty-please with sugar on top, would be stupid.  They can't take chances in situations like that.  They would have aslo HAD to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others.

"           the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours -  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. 'I had never been treated like that in my life,' he said. 'I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed.'  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  'We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,' said Dr. Rajcoomar. 'So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.'                "

"              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

"           Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when his telephone rang.  'Hallo, Mr. Hussein!', a heavily accented voice said. 'This is Paddy, down at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!'  'Well, Paddy,' Saddam replied, 'this is indeed important news! How big is your army?'  'Right now,' said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, 'there is myself, my cousin Sean, my next door neighbor Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!'  Saddam paused. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command.'  'Begorra!', said Paddy. 'I'll have to ring you back!'  Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!'  'And what equipment would that be, Paddy?' Saddam asked.  'Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.'  Saddam sighed. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1 and a half million since we last spoke.'  'Saints preserve us!' said Paddy. 'I'll have to get back to you.'  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Pub have joined us as well!'  Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!'  'Holy Mary, and Joseph!', said Paddy, 'I'll have to ring you back.'  Paddy called again the next day. 'Top o' the mornin,' Mr. Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war.'  'I'm sorry to hear that,' said Saddam. 'Why the sudden change of heart?'  'Well,' said Paddy, 'we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and decided there's no way we can feed two million prisoners.'         "

"           i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used 'for missions targeting the United States.'  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           "

"           I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.           "
"           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         "
"           A stay would be 'the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process,' Republicans argued. But that's exactly the point: there is no 'federal election process.' Elections, even for national office, are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats. The highest arbiter of election disputes is each state's supreme court.  The 2000 Florida dispute resulted in Republicans--historically the great champions of states' rights--obtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states' constitutionally-protected control of elections. An appeal of the Florida Supreme Court's decision, no matter how flawed that decision may have been, violated the Constitution. The fact that Renhquist et al. agreed to hear Bush v. Gore is what makes Bush's regime illegal. Had the court installed Gore rather than Bush, Gore would be the usurper. Recounts, hanging chads, choosing Bush over Gore--those details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup d'tat.  A Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court broke the law on behalf of George W. Bush. Would they do it for Douglas Forrester? 'The elites beat up on the Supreme Court very severely for Bush v. Gore,' commented conservative George Mason University professor Dan Polsby. 'I'm sure they don't relish being beat up by those elites again.' On Oct. 7 the Supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the Florida case--they refused to hear the case, without comment.  Election disputes, after all, are resolved by each state's supreme court.    urlLink - Ted Rall,  The Ironic Implication of the New Jersey Imbroglio           "

"           Ben - I did not answer the questions because the rephrasing seemed to suggest that the words weren't read at all, which annoyed me because I was in a mood conducive to such. Mir - I answered the first question in my previous post.  In an ideal world, I would answer affirmatively to the second question.  This is not an ideal world, and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, so some socially-agreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves.  I suggest 'governmental action' because my initial assumption, that proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, precludes the private sector doing anything unless profit is possible or even guaranteed.

"           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           "

"           Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.         "

"           The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13  The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  'We will never raise more money than the Republicans  never,' said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. 'We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message.'  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  'I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees,' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.'  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.               "

"             Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this               "

"           A quick note, kids: Life has a funny way of working out (to paraphrase Alanis), and the irony of it all is a balm to sooth even the deepest hurts. For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S. The wierdest part was going from 20 degrees and 24' of snow in New Hampshire to 78 degrees and sunny in Hawaii in less than 24 hours.         "

"           I agree with John's comments re: TTT.  I also had issues.  But as a movie, I daresay Joe Moviegoer gets his motherf*ing money's worth in terms of images.  Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.         "

"           For those that have not seen Two Towers yet, read carefully.  Nothing I consider a spoiler, but you may disagree.  As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.         "

"           Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          "
"           chris, i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler, not trent lott. actually, i wasn't really comparing hitler to anyone in particular; i was showing an example of how a person can say something that is not overtly racist but could easily be perceived that way.    i agree for the most part with everything that jls said.  this controversy about trent lott really is just a form of misdirection:  so we aren't discussing real problems and coming up with solid and practical solutions.    and like i said in my post, i knew it was an extreme example - it was mostly for fun.         "
"           It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of 'colored' people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word 'colored,' perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought 'Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words.'  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.         "
"           Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          "
"           all right, john - i'll use an extreme example but they are always the most fun :) let's say, for whatever reason, that hitler had immigrated to america, and soon all of his nazi past was pretty much forgotten, he had been elected to the senate by the fine state of south carolina multiple times, and hell, he even had some jews on his staff. okay, it's hitler's 100th birthday.  trett lott gets up and says 'you know adolf, things would have been very different if you would have won world war II, we could have avoided alot of the problems we have now.' now you could assume that trett lott was referring to the autobahn, the volkswagon, the revived german economy, the growth of industry, but you know, no matter how you look at it, you can't get past the idea that one of hitler's main objectives in world war II was to kill all the jews.   some people would find it offensive that trent lott would even conceive that the idea of oppressing/killing a group of people as part of your political platform would be appropriate.   i think that's why people are offended about his comments to strom thurmond.         "
"           Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

"           Damn!  Has it really been three weeks since I last posted?  As the RTG people know, Julie was readmitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago.  Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to 'hold out' (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!  And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session.

"           wtf...   see karl - this is what we should have been talking about last night instead of this silly trent lott thing. The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  'The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system,' R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' 'Economic Report to the President,' scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: '[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder.'  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to 'take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class,' emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers 'on the outskirts of poverty.' At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  'Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?' he asked. 'If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes.'  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  'If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed,' said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  'These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich,' said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We're going back some 70 years.'  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: 'I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor.'  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  'This issue is coming to a head,' DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 'You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs.'  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas 'the duck's feet under the water,' propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, 'The Non-Taxpaying Class.'  'Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else,' the editorial stated. 'They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.'  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  'It's hard to conclude it's anything else,' said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  'I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls,' he said. 'That doesn't seem like a good political agenda.'  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  'The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes,' Matsui said. 'I'd love to debate him on that.'  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  'I would hope the public would find it repugnant,' he said, 'but I suppose you never know.'           "

"           Greetings from the West Coast -- wanted everyone to know that I woke our little Benjamin up to make sure he was OK. I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for 'Drumline,' used my free pass (see details below) to get into 'Die Another Day,' then walked across the hall into 'Nemesis' -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with 'Drumline.' The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, 'Nemesis' was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not 'Khan.' I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is 'Search for Data,' I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry. Anybody keeping up with 'Enterprise,' please contradict me and convince me that I'm wrong.  That's all from the Left coast. Hope everyone has a Peaceful holiday!         "

It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.         "
"           That's nothing! You should have heard him at 5:30 in the morning on the radio....  Ask him about backwards masking the Tiffany song!  Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?         "

"           - I have decided that the Oklahoma City bombing was worthy of shock; September 11 was not.  The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.  The Puritans are far more evident in our national psyche than the spirit of '76 ever was. - The only thing that will ever unify the humans species is an overwhelming threat from beyond our planet.  In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.  Everything else will forever be violent variations of existing themes. - Love is not what someone does for you, or what you do for someone; it is persistent and mindful engagement in another's spiritual growth. - I wish to be the citizen of a nation; not the subject of an empire. - Women have a right to be angry at the media's pervasive images, but I don't know what they can do to solve it.  As soon as a coherent and effective plan is formed, I'll back it all the way. - Writing is dreaming in language.  This is why poetry is the highest form of the language arts, because in it words are pre-verbal.  Rhetoric does not occur until the mind moves the language from pre-verbal dream into the public sphere. - We think by pattern matching.  This is why it is not foolish to open the refrigerator when  you need the microwave.  Both have doors and handles; you are acting on the premature matching of an incomplete pattern. - It seems everything I see is an advertisement. - Music is humanity's greatest artistic achievement. - I am grateful for cinnamon toast.

I'm training Transportation Security Administration baggage screeners at your nation's airports. That's why I'm here in LA (where, I hesitate to mention, that it's sixty degrees and sunny).  Benjamin -- I can see already that you are right about the blog -- it IS chaotic and more than a little confusing!  Will someone hold my hand?  Ms. Streisand -- Mr. Shipley has nothing but wonderful things to say about you. I look forward to greeting you and your college-aged piece of ass in person.  Yesterday afternoon at LAX, a ceramic plate tested positive for explosives residue and even failed a radiation test. It almost shut down the airport. The bomb dog decided it wasn't a threat and the LEO (Law Enforcement Official) determined that the lady carrying it had a credible story. If any of you are traveling for the holidays, might I suggest shipping your presents separately?  What else do I need to know about this realm?         "

CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtainloud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying doas if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.

"           She wears a diaphanous black gown, her small feet shod in black boots, cautiously padding down the corridor.  She bears a resemblance to her brothers and sisters though her 'gifts' are of a different nature.  She has red hair, eyes that go from blue to green to grey, petite and very pale, normally a somber look on her face.  She has three brothers and two sisters:  she is brooding and philosophical like Dream, understands the purpose and beauty of Death, shares the insanity of Delirium, has coldness and indifference like Desire and Destiny, envies Destruction for his ability to walk away.   When you first meet her, you would think she is her own nemesis.  She understands your grief and pain and you feel compelled to share and have her listen.  And she understands and you feel soothed.  Then she gives back your burdens to you but adds some and she grieves for you and all the others that she cannot help, but is immobile by her nature.   I take on the mantle of the last sibling.

"           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

"           All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.

Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.

BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set.

"            urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            "

He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it.

"            urlLink BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.   urlLink - Ted Rall           "

"           The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.  She's truly my hero -- anyone else in her conditions (and they are plural) would have given in to depression, cynicism, and bitterness long ago.  That she smiles and sings and laughs and dreams is a tribute to the depth of her courage and the size of her heart, and I'm not saying that just because I love her.  If more people could shine a light like hers, the world would be a far better place.  May we all learn that the secret to happiness is perspective, gratitude, and the love of a beautiful person.         "

"           now, is chris's wife preggers?         "
"           Wow, a debate with more than me and Mr. Wigglepants involved.  First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the 'arrogant conservative President' comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.           "
"           Disclaimer:  The ideological phallus of which I spoke, or rather the waving of such, refers primarily to government officials of all stripes and the numerous pundits and talking heads who appear in the various media.

"           Good luck on your interview.  I only hope that all these strategies, while relevant to rational opponents, transfer smoothly when applied to irrational opponents.  I'm not entirely convinced that the policymakers in control right now fully understand how different it is when your opponent perceives him- or herself as the servant of God.  Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.  I must say, though, that I'm glad we're sending *billions* to Turkey so they'll let us put a base there.  I'd hate to think we could have wasted some of that money on collapsing school buildings, kids without health insurance, or parents unable to tend to their mentally ill children.  For now, I'll continue to reluctantly support the 'war,' such as it is; I'll reserve more comprehensive judgment until more time has passed.         "

I have to say that the military has become a very effective instrument of exporting the good parts of America. See Dana Priest's new book: 'The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace With America's Military' for more information (and very engaging reading) about how the US military has successfully stepped in and delivered peace and security in places like Kosovo when institutions like the UN have failed utterly.

But I don't think that's the image we're really showing right now.             "

"           Thanks for the dance response -- I understood it better than the previous post.  Curious:  So when will we get around to addressing the reason?  It seems to me we've been leaving the reason for later since 1948.  Which is acceptable, if it has indeed taken these 50+ years to put out the flames (although my amateur eyes don't see the fire getting smaller).  How many years does one fight flames until one can reach the oil flow?  Analogies Amok -- Am I correct in rephrasing that violent terrorists of any kind flourish because there is very little oxygen (economic growth) in the room, and the terrorists supply a half-opened window; and that in this room, everyone else (the mass population) can't breathe clearly, and thus can't think clearly; and that our intent is to force oxygen into the room, thus allowing everyone (the mass population) to breathe easier, which will allow them to gather their wits, and be happy, thus making the terrorists and their little half-opened window irrelevant?

Do we use that power to shut ourselves off from the world, turn inward and merrily go along, fiddly dee, tomorrow is another day? I think that we are 50 years past the time when the oceans could protect our country from the world (see 9/11). Like it or not, we have the opportunity to raise the world's standard of living, to bring hope, elightenment and cash flow to billions who would never know the joys of good dental hygene or low infant mortality rates, or education (which are the flip sides of consumerism and Jerry Springer). We must engage the parts of the world that hate us, and let them see the things that make our country and our system great, so that they can understand that it is not just about McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents.

"           And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario:  Yes, we're at a party, and yes, we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's 'Dead Man's Party' sounds pretty good to me right now...), and yes, we'd love for everyone to dance. But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.         "

"           Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.          "
"           Sadly, I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out, but that will not happen, nor should it.  There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.         "
"           Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.         "

"           If I am understanding you correctly, you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.  That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.  But, appeasement does not work.  Just ask Neville Chamberlain.         "
"           If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

"           To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.  Rage never dies, and it always finds a way.          "
"           I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.  I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said 'OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between 'defying' an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.         "
"           Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.  We -- the citizens of this country -- are about to be enlisted in a cause for which we may die.  Not the soldiers, not the pilots, not the marines -- us.  The question is not are you willing to sacrifice the professional soldiers for this cause -- but are you willing to sacrifice yourself, on the battlefield of the shopping mall or apartment building?  Are you willing to trade the life of your three-year-old so that peace will prevail?  Because the Apache helicopter is awfully hard to hit.  But a playground, now -- right down the road from you -- that's easy pickings.  I suspect a great many people have not made the logical connection from the desert waaaaay over there to their own office building.  Sure, we watched the WTC fall; we watched the people jumping from windows.  But it is human nature to believe oneself immortal; to believe it's all a video game.  Which it is, until the stage catches fire and the night club is filling with smoke and you're reminded that Hey, dude, this is, like, real.  This posting is not for or against the war -- just a reminder that a vote for it is a tacit acceptance of the possibility that the cost of the goal will not be professional soldiers, but your niece, burned or gassed or diseased or shot.  Granted, one may feel that is going to happen anyway, so what the hell.  And a valid argument can be made for that.  I just hope our eyes are open.  Wide.         "

"           from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan, and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict, how much destruction would result, and 'how deep' the corruption of the Iraqi government goes. The administration has declined to estimate how long U.S. forces would remain in Iraq. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman told Congress last week that it might be two years before the Iraqis regained administrative control of their country. But 'they're terrified of being caught in a time frame,' said retired Army Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, one of a number of senior military and civilian experts who have been briefed by the Pentagon on the plan. 'My own view is that it will take five years, with substantial military power, to establish and exploit the peace' in Iraq.           "
"           op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

"           hmmm.. why i'm against the war with iraq.  1. there seems to be no defined reason why we are specifically going to war with iraq as opposed to any other nation.  they are other countries which have violated u.n. sanctions and decrees (here in the us we simply don't sign the agreements or ignore them) 2. iraq is not a genuine threat to u.s. interests - which violates the powell doctrine (colin powell) that the u.s. should only enter a war when u.s. interests are clearly at stake - he bases that philosophy on his experiences in vietnam. 3. there is limited public support for this war.  a war without public support is not likely to get the funding it needs to be successful. 4. yes, of course, we could win the war against iraq if all we wanted to do was to bomb it and then leave.however,  bush has said that there will be a regime change.  this will require years of occupation by the u.s. military in order to have a peaceful transition - if one is possible.  after an u.s. invasion - it is likely that muslim fundamentalist will be the most organized and well-funded group in iraq. 5. assuming the u.s. does win this war, the kurds, which at this time mainly occupied the u.n. controlled northern half of iraq, would demand their own country.  this would cause unrest in turkey which has a sizeable kurdish population.  turkey would not want to give up land or anything else to the kurds - the kurds are considered 'terrorists' in turkey. 6. as mr. wigglepants pointed out, this also does not solve any of the problems that exist in the middle east.  the islamic population will still believe that the u.s. is occupying muslim lands and should leave.  the palestinians  will still not have a homeland.  the israelis will still be hated by the rest of the middle eastern community.   7. war is wrong unless it is the absolute last resort - diplomacy is still an option. 8.  what gives the u.s. the right to dispose of a leader?  and why just saddam hussein?  where does it go from here?  9. how does this fight the war on terrorism?  will we be safer after this?

Try to take fear away from the fearful, and they get angry.  There is a fierce pride in fear:  the fearful perceive fear as a sign of intelligence; those without fear are deemed stupid or ill-informed.  It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.  It seems nearly impossible to make any decision free of fear.  Fear appears to be not an emotion, but rather the inescapable, invisible framework of human experience.

"           thought this might infuriate john and chris; inspire ben and well, i guess just me and ben - Director Moore criticizes U.S.-Iraq war  March 23, 2003  |     Michael Moore criticized President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq during his acceptance speech at Sunday's Academy Awards, drawing a partial standing ovation and some jeers from Hollywood's elite.   The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war          "
"           Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing, I'm thinking.  Halle Berry's dress was a bit unflattering...and it's hard to NOT flatter that body.  I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, 'Shit!' when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was 'Zorro' and 'Traffic,' so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).

You should know them already.  1)  FALSE.  2) FALSE.  3) FALSE  As for the oil argument, I can think of three much easier targets militarily and one domestically than spending billions of dollars invading a relatively well defended country.  Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to 'conquer' them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.         "

"           1. I believe oil is one reason of several, and the coalition gives varying priorities to each.  I would need more information and expertise to rank them on my own; however, I do doubt the validity of some of the reasons, only because they are not treated equally in all situations.  2. I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say 'in general' because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.  I would be delighted for the outcome to show that Iraq is an exception.  -- I respectfully decline Chris' offer of immunity; others are free to respond to my post.         "
"           hey ang, how did  your audition go?         "
"           Mir: Please tell me you don't really believe that oil is the reason we are at war. Please tell me that you are just writing the party line because you are in the grip of dispair and it is prevent you from thinking for yourself.   For that matter, by a voice vote -- who here believes oil the the reason we are at war? I am very curious about the legs on this line of thinking. For that matter (again):  Who here thinks that giving the inspectors more time would have brought this crisis to a peaceful conclusion? Who believes that leaving Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance?  All you lurkers out there -- here's your chance to chime in. I won't lecture or post about your responses -- I'm just curious about how everyone is feeling about this adventure. So, to recap, three questions, true or false answers -- and if you'd like, email me (crk@mindspring.com): 1. Oil is the reason we are at war. 2. Allowing the inspectors more time to search Iraq would have lead to a peaceful conclusion. 3. Leaving Saddam Hussein in power is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance (with the very real possibility of chaos and failure to create a viable government).

The irony of Paul's quote re: the sandstorm, on the eve of the current war, is that it could apply to both sides.  That's as far as the implication, such as it is, goes.

He was simply telling us what he had to do.   The pope sent a cardinal from the Vatican to have an hour's discussion with Bush--not about politics, but about theology.

As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

"           Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.  But it's also a big part of why we're a fat nation, too...           "

President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         "

"           Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.         "
"           Back to my male pigginess.  Looking at the Entertainment Weekly picture, first let me say that the blonde on the right who looks to be about 6' 6' tall would be drop dead gorgeous if she lost some of the eye shadow.  Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).  I could go with a description I heard from my boss today and describe where as one with the Porky Piggish face.  I'll stick with the general fat/skinny adjectives.           "

It was very much a love me, love my cat situation.  Well, it took about half an hour.  Shadow was a very affectionate cat.  She would generally come when called.  She would even deign to play with us from time to time.  When she was about 14, she became listless and uninterested in eating.  I even tried tuna.  Previously, whenever we would even pop open a can of tuna, eShadow came flying in and loudly meowed and rubbed agains you to let you know what she wanted.  She was still uninterested.  She to stopped using the litter box.  We took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with renal failure.  The vet told us that one of her kidneys had atrophied, and the other was giving out.  We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.  But, she eventually started sliding again.  I had the difficult task of coming home one afternoon to find her dead.  It was one of the most upsetting things that has happened in my life, even though I knew it was coming.  That one cat has made me open to the possibility of having cats in the future.  We have opted to wait until the children a older to introduce a kitten.  The bottom line is that I feel for you Mir.         "

Annakin starts to surpass his fellow apprentice; resentment and jealousy brews; something goes wrong; Annakin makes a hotheaded choice that leaves Qui-Gon in a bad spot and he gets killed.  A rift begins between Obi-Wan and Annakin.  Follow through to final confrontation and betrayal.  A whole family unit falls apart.  Mythical, even Biblical.  Wow.  That's great stuff.

"           Now that I think of it, there's no continuity trouble with Chewbacca appearing in III and IV.  In Mos Eisely, we see Obi-Wan discussing with Chewbacca (no dialogue heard, Chewie just nods); a few moments later, Obi-Wan introduces Chewbacca to Luke as 'Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.'  They could certainly have met before, possibly as pilot and paying passenger.  It would push the irony angle a bit much for me if Chewie had met Annakin before, and thus served as co-pilot for his son on the way to the Death Star.  But then, Darth Vader made Threepio, so what the hell.         "

"           John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings?  If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.         "

"           Miriam (Congratulations, BTW), you are making some gross, as in large, assumptions concerning the looting.  You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted.  Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.  Johnnathan - No.  And, did we even have advanced notice of the destruction anyway?         "
"           Perhaps I am not being clear.  I'll rephrase:  1) Should people be angry at us because the Iraqis chose to loot their own artifacts and heritage?  2) Should people be angry at us for not stopping the Taliban's destruction of the Buddhist carvings?         "
"           short answer: yes.  we should have stopped it.  look at previous posts for justifications.         "

"           Ok, you're right about the slippers.         "
"           that's not entirely my point, harmony.  one of the ways we are justifying this war is by saying we are freeing the iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.  when did it become our responsibility to become the world's liberators?  there are over 100 nations that currently are violating u.n. human rights mandates - are we going to invade all of them?  my point being is that we were there, we knew the signifigance of the artifacts; we should have stopped it. and, once again, people are offended that the only place we protected was the ministry of oil.  what message does that send to the iraqi people and the world about why we are there? and madonna you would snatch those slippers up in a second and you know it.

"           So it is our responsibility to protect people from looting or destroying their own nation's culture and history?         "
"           i would think that people are upset about the looting of the iraqi's muesums because the u.s. military did nothing to protect them.   we (the u.s) understood the signifigance of those artifacts even if the iraqi people didn't.  The most disturbing thing is that the only building protected during the looting was the ministry of oil.  it does look poorly on us that we thought that was more important than a nation's culture and history.         "
"           Clarificaton:  I am specifically addressing the artifact/museum issue.  I am not addressing the looting of government property or the looting of private businesses and homes.  The former is understandable given the country's oppressive history; the latter, while unfortunate, is standard practice in any riot or period of lawlessness.         "
"           I've been thinking about this...how, exactly, is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts?  They're not our children.  It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?         "

"           Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?         "
"           I could also have had an obtuse moment.  It's certainly happened before.  I may have unconsciously given up on the movie early on, resulting in me not paying close enough attention.  If so, sloppy movie viewing on my part.         "
"           I caught it the first time.  I did not think it was obscure.  He was also the guy in the coucil chamber trying to urge his captain to go look for the Nebudchanazar (sp?)         "

"           He's the fellow who Smith blends with before he can reach the phone.  Later, he's seen attempting to sneak up on and attack Neo in Zion.  I also missed it at first.  If a key plot point is that difficult to communicate, something's wrong with the writing.  It's the last image of the film, for crying out loud, and a lot of viewers aren't getting it.         "

While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.         "

"           The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.         "
"           I agree with Johnathan about the stupidity of his being robbed of choice in the end.  Read  urlLink my blog  for more of my thoughts.  I'm honestly too upset to think about it right now.  I know that's stupid because it's just a farkin' TV show, but I get this way about characters in books as well...I just get completely emotionally involved in them, and their tragedies devastate me.  I'm far too empathetic for my own good.         "
"           I was wondering how you were doing today Angie.  Did Spike and Buffy hook up in that last night?  To me, they kind of left that to our imagination.         "
"           Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.  It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to read it all.  I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over 'discrepancies' of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?         "

"           I agree with some of your points, and disagree with others.  Thanks for the dialogue.         "
"           as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be 'good' if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her 'cookieness' was worth it.            "
"           I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.         "

"           Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments?  Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks?  Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story, but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves?  Always, always, always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.         "
"           Ok, so of my list of fatalities, I got one and a half right - Spike and Anya.  I had Anya on the 50/50 list, thus only half credit.  How the heck is Spike going to appear on Angel?

"           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         "

"           i'm probably becoming fascinated by minutia here, but the 'upper / lower case' labeling interests me.  now that you've created a definition for the terms, will they only be used in emails and other text-based exchanges of ideas?  in conversation, no one will be able to hear the distinction between the two; would you come up with different terms for your beliefs to use when you were speaking to someone, or would you explain which type of r/Republican you were each time?  if in that same conversation (or another), if the person you were talking to said 'i'm a d/Democrat', would you ask them what sort of d/Democrat they were, or would you just make an assumption?  since you mentioned that this is a new thing, it's cool if you don't know the answers to these questions yet - i was just curious.

"           i agree that there are no absolutes and none should be attempted.  however, the purpose of these types of discussions can be to point out the black and white merely so the majority can discover that there are areas of gray.   in order to have a balance you must have both sides argued.         "
"           Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         "
"           i'm going to the bahamas!  pajamas!         "
"           in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case 'republican' and 'democrat.'  i ignore them merely out of laziness not aesthetics but thanks for the benefit of the doubt - i am in this discourse referring to the concept  of the republican and democratic parties. and i would absolutely agree with harmony's statement that many people are beneficiaries of our lack of social darwinism in this country and are fairly unaware of it.  not many of us would survive in a truly competitive society.  and those who do believe it, in my opinion, are not only insensitive elitists but also sadists.  to ignore one group's suffering or difficulties because they do not match or compliment the most dominant or successful group is disgusting.  we can judge ourselves by how we treat the lowest of our society - i would think a vegan of all people would understand that.   however, when i hear people speak of the ethical dilemna faced by genetic counseling, i do not see the issue.  if someone can be spared the pain of illness or an impariment than let it be.  yes, yes, we get into the whole concept of how a society decides what is aberrant but really, when do we start discussing the realities of people's lives?  in my own case, as many of you know, have suffered from clinical depression for most of my life - i now take medication to control it.  if this could have been prevented before i was born, would i have approved?  you are damn right.  my depression did not build my character - it stripped away years of happiness from me and no one should have that burden placed upon them even if some intellectuals seem to want to make the world suffer in order to satisfy some form of philosophy. and neb, your questions about who runs what are just questions of policy.  what a country would we be living in if only education was taken that seriously! and yes, neb, i know you think life is a cycle but all we can do is try to do what is best - and yes, that is subjective not only to each culture but to each individual but we all have to start realizing some things are wrong.  murder is wrong.  rape is wrong.  letting people suffer needlessly is wrong.           "
"           r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.         "
"           I have observed that Social Darwinists are often ignorant of the interdependencies that got them where they are.  Self reliance is equal parts reality and illusion.         "
"           JLS - i've not heard of the difference between 'upper-' and 'lower-case' democracts and republicans.  enlighten us...         "
"           part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets:   *sometimes*, you're dealing with social darwinists, who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.  as they see it, the species, and society, is only as strong as its weakest link; ergo, if you continue to coddle the poorest and weakest elements of the population, they will only continue to breed more poor and weak persons.  evolution has proven time and again that when a given species fails to act or become as strong or stronger than their competitors, they soon go the route of extinction.  mind you, this is a rather extreme point of view, and i seriously doubt that anyone who subscribed to it would come right out and confirm this (at least, in political circles).  there are plenty of milder versions of this philsophy out there - and more extreme ones.  eugenics was committed to the idea that, ultimately, we should set a standard for the human race in regards to intelligence, strength and attractiveness, and eliminate any member of the population who did not meet the minimum requirements established by this standard - or at least discourage if not prevent those same members from producing offspring.  this sort of thing is done all the time to other species by farmers and their ilk; why not on our own race, some have asked.  involuntary sterilization of institutionalized mentally retarded persons continued in virginia until about the seventies or so, i believe.  it does raise some interesting questions about the short term sacrifice, long term gain strategy that miriam spoke of; if via genetics, we could eliminate all disease, physical and mental disability, etc. from the human race via the systematic use of genetic manipulation prior and during each and every human conception, why shouldn't we, for the betterment of our species?  this assumes that the genetics in question were tried and true, and took into account the need to allow for some diversity in order to prevent the human race from being wiped out in one pass by a new, never before seen disease.  as for education of and for all youth, i'm all for it - but who's in charge of creating the curriculum?  should it be creatively or technically driven?  should it be paid for on a county, state or nationwide basis, or some combination thereof?  should teachers or parents have more control and responsibility for children's behavior?  should we offer the benefits of education only to citizens of our country, or to those of others as well?    as for 'the social contract which dictates that that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do', it certainly sounds like a good and benevolent concept; the problem with those social contracts is that nobody has to sign them.    in the end, the policies and procedures of the nation (and the world, to a degree) are decided by rich men in high towers, as it has been for thousands of years.  there is a revolution every now and again, and occasionally the men in question are dragged out and shot; but the towers remain, and eventually, someone takes up residence once again.  without them, there can be no true order; with them, there can be no real freedom.         "
"           I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term 'best services.'  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.         "
"           to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game -  you need to have  good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.  republicans overall don't seem to understand the concept of short term sacrifices for long term goals.  for instance - something close to my own life - autistic children.  there is a program in place which can actually 'cure' up to 60 percent of all children with autism.  the price of this treatment ranges from free in some states (california) to 55,000 dollars per student in others (virginia)  the conservatives in this state go no we can't put more money into special education!  we don't have the budget!  but what they don't realize or seem to realize is that if they invest the money now they can save money on special education for the rest of the students' lives (the treatment generally takes 2-3 years), not have to pay for special services as they get older - this will actually save money in the long run!!!  and also, don't we have a social contract which dictates that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do?

"           Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.               "

"           Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.           "
"            from  urlLink Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.

"
"           red - perhaps you could start by thinking about the design on your back.  It seems to have been important enough to have it permanently tattooed on your body.  Unless your interpretation of its meaning applies to something completely different.         "
"           That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.  I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, becaue I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them. :)         "
"           really, do you ever feel like there are people or situations in the world that exist to test you?  i know that claims alot of ego because that would mean that somewhere in the universe someone or something is concerned about your individual enlightenment - but it does seem that way sometimes.           "
"           i suppose my question is then how do we get the two to harmonize?         "

Both paths have risks, but only one can lead to happiness. So do not simply coast along thinking maybe this is as good as it gets. This is not as good as it gets. It gets much better than this.

"           Q. In a recent Answer Man, you stated Johnny Depp based his character in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' on Keith Richards. While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   'Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' '  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen. That's why actors get the big bucks.         "
"           Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the 'bad guys' are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'          "

As in:  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  *shrug*  That kind of means, 'This is what I'm saying, and after saying it, I'm shrugging, most likely in real life as I type it.'   Out of curiosity, why is this so important to you?  I never really gave it much thought before now.   And Tree, I had originally typed the phrase phonetically, but I thought Ben wouldn't know what I was talking about, so I went with the actual spelling of the words so as not to confuse anyone.  Johnny Depp is a fine example of anything, I agree.         "
"           ok, i think i understand your definition of the 'shrug' - but what about the timing aspect that i mentioned?  is the shrug occuring within the post, or a moment later, as the format of the text suggests?         "

I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.         "

From darkhorizons:  '...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film.'  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)         "

"           A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'

"
"           My daughter is 3 1/2 years old.  She is almost a vegetarian.  The only meat she will eat is chicken, and that is only sometimes.  She drinks lots of milk (24-30 oz a day).  For comparrison, most doctors recommend that growing teenagers get about that same amount.  She also usually will eat cheese when it is offered, and she eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Most of her calories are coming from bread, fruit, and vegetables.    My questions is this, how do vegetarians get the protein they need?  I know that soy (tofu) is a good source, but I really doubt she will eat it.  I only eat it when it is in hot & sour soup, so I also would have no idea how to offer it to her.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated         "

"           An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of 'Eyes Without a Face'...  *****  '....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          "

"           Castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal.  The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.         "

"           Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.  Miriam, hope you realize that you're hanging out with me when I get home, cause you have to meet him.  Okay.  That's all.         "
"           yep, mir = rocktober.         "
"           ooyeah/Happy Roctober = Miriam?  Anyway, just got back from my world domination meeting.....err, company staff meeting.  The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.  Never having had back problems (knocking on every piece of wood I can find), I can't imagine the pain that people must go through to become addicted to Oxicontin.         "

"           john, you are so funny.  :)  even though i don't completely understand what you meant about the raw data and the thermal imaging - science and such is not my thing so if someone could explain that for the scientifically illiterate, i would appreciate it. and for all of you people out there who hate the left, you'll be pleased to know that ben and i should be starting up our show again sometime in the next few months!  and one of our main objectives of this program is to get whomever is running against bush elected.  i mean we just hate bush.   anyway, not all conservatives are bad -  heck, my parents are republicans.  and i do feel very sorry for rush - it's horrible for him and his family that he would have such a awful addiction.  i do dislike al franken more after hearing reports of what he said.  if he disagrees with rush on ideas, policy, etc, that is one thing but to celebrate when another fellow human being is suffering is reprehensible.           "
"           Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             "

"            All batteries eventually die. The iPod battery is quite replaceable; various vendors are available online. You can do it yourself, or Apple can do it for you. Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:  urlLink iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the  urlLink old  and  urlLink new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?          "
"           I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.  As for my agreement regarding his take on the protest -- well, yes, I agree it was his take, since it was his protest, not mine, and those were his reasons.  They seemed valid grievances to me.  I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.         "

"           JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!          "

"           My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.         "
"           Nick - I'm not ignoring your post or your points, but I need sometime to make sure that my response is a cogent as your post.  I don't agree with much of it, but it was a very good post.  Time to get back to the grindstone.         "
"            Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?  Ridiculous?  Yes.  But stranger things have happened - remember the woman who spilled hot coffee on herself and won millions of dollars from McDonald's in a lawsuit?  Once the courts get involved, just about anything can happen.          "

"           Johnathan - In one of your responses concerning the Ten Commandements, you stated (correctly) that you are not a 13th century BCE Hebrew, implying to me that you did not think that something proposed 3,300 years ago has no place in today's society because we have changed over time.  I submit to you that we are not 4th century BCE Greeks, therefore the notion of the Republican form of government proposed by Plato (or at least written about by Plato) has no place in today's society.  I may have my information incorrect on Plato, as I don't remember much ancient history, but the specifics are not that important to my point.  Just because a concept is old does not mean it does not have modern relevance.  Where do you draw the line?  3,000 years - there goes the Ten Commandments 2,000 years - there goes the Republican form of government 1,000 years - there goes the Magna Carta 500 years - I can't think of anything except for the discovery the New World. 200 years - there goes the US Constitution 100 years - there go workers/consumers rights (labor unions / Sherman Anti-Trust laws)          "

"           In somewhat of an answer to your question Johnathan (in case it was a serious question)  176. Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         "

"           I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.  It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clampdown on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.  It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year.  As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.  Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.  Er, I'd better go.  *or, Eva informs me, Virginia. Damn it, that's another Christmas tradition that I'll have to miss this year.         "
"           john - i don't think the issue here is whether our laws have a judeo-christian origin or not.  nor do i think that conservatives are desperate to educate the masses regarding common law.  it is the intent, john, that is the problem. by having the ten commandments displayed, it is promoting a particular religion - that being christianity - if you saw a copy of a section of the koran everwhere, you could believe that religion was being promoted.   the u.s. government is not supposed to endorse any religion -         "
"           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named 'Donnie Darko' several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them'          "
"           I have flag sticker in my cube that was left behind by the previous occupant.  Can someone recommend the appropriate way to dispose of this sticker, should I decide to remove it?

"           The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         "
"           Yeah, but then you would have laws passed against attempted flag burning and impersonating a flag  (TIC)         "
"           Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy?  Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed?  What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another, respect their parents, don't steal, don't bear false witness against your neighbor, and don't cover your neighbor's possessions?  I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).  Of course, if people did not kill others, then the need for capital punishment would be greatly reduced.  Any, the principles expressed in the commandments sound like pretty good fundamentals to live by to me, and totally non-religious in nature if you ignore where they supposedly came from.    Eva - My point with the statues is what point was toppling a statue of Bush supposed to prove?  I really doubt that anyone in the US will be convinced not to vote for Bush because the people in another country don't like him.  Anyone who considers the actions of the protestors in deciding not to vote for Bush will probably have already decided not to based on many other factors.  As for France and Germany, why would they care if you toppled statues or burned their leaders in effigy?  I'm sure 90%+ of their citizens could care less what we in the US think of their leaders.  All I'm saying is that the reverse is true.  (P.S. Thanks for the trivia information on French Fries.  Don't blame me for someone way back thinking that Flemish Fries did not have the same ring.)  If the British don't like the way their PM is buddying up to the US/Bush, then they should do whatever is necessary under the procedures of Parliament to bring down the government.  If the British Parliament is anything like Israel's or Italy's procedurally, then it should not be difficult.  The British protesting our President accomplishes nothing productive.  We are not going to impeach our President because he is unpopular in England.  The last time I checked, we won a war 222 years ago so that we would not have to take orders from them.  Ben - I don't quite understand the difference between how you typed the one sentence (Free speech just does not apply...) compared to what I typed.  To me they say the same thing.  Then again, my degree is in engineering not english.  The point I was trying to make was regardless of the standard that is set for the definition of free speech, it must be applied universally to the socially acceptable topics (Civil rights) and the socially unacceptable topics (white supremacy).  Burning things in peoples yards (i.e. burning a cross in a black family's yard) is not freedom of speech, but a form of intimidation (and probably terrorism under the Patriot Act).  But, a bunch of guys in a farmer's field, with his permission, burning a cross and spouting their hate speech must be accepted as freedom of speech IF we are going to say that burning the flag is.  If a law is passed to make burning the flag illegal, then doing so is no longer a question social acceptability/unacceptability, but strictly legal versus illegal.  If someone, right now, were to burn a flag in front of me, I would not try to have them arrested because he has not violated any law.  What I am saying is that I think that there should be a law against it.  For my part, when I see someone burning a flag in protest, even if I might have been supportive of their cause previously, they have lost my support, and may have even pushed me to be against it depending on what their cause is.  Johnathan - Somewhere back aways, you were asking about other ways of defiling the flag, I think.  When a flag gets old or tattered, there are ceremonies to cover properly destroying the flag.  Under standard flag etiquette, the flag that was on top of the WTC should have been destroyed long ago, but it has now become a different type of symbol all together.         "
"           Perhaps one could create a cloth flag that lacks one stripe, or several stars, and set *that* on fire.  It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a 'Flag Threatening,' in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.         "
"           john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  ' Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.          "
"           I will repeat the question:  What should be done *now*?  A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.         "
"           The protest wasn't against the war.  Where the hell did you guys hear that?  It was against Bush visting England.  People here are incredibly angry at him and they didn't want the US media to have a nice photo-op moment showing how loved Bush is in England, America's best friend.  And the march slogan was simple: 'Go home Bush!'  The protest was awesome!  Over 200,000 people were there.  I think that we got the point across that Bush is not welcome here.   By the way, why on Earth would you topple down statues of Chirac and Schroeder?  For not siding with the US in an illegal invasion of a country?  Were you too busy eating Freedom Fries to realize that countries have the freedom not to side with the US when it does bad things?

"           Does any country know how to solve complex problems?  It seems analogous to hoping that a single wave will reshape a coastline.  Change occurs over long periods of time, according to the effects of many disparate forces, each acting separately and often without any awareness of the other.  The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

"           i agree with you johnathan - it does seem silly to protest a war that has happened and what exactly is the message now that we couldn't really leave without causing more chaos than before.  (ie, afghanistan)  i believe one of the major problems with protests at this point is that there is no clear message that can be chanted as you march.  like, 'we didn't want this war in the first place, even though saddam was a horrible dictator, but there are horrible dictators across the globe, but now we hope for democracy, but that doesn't seem to be happening, and how can we afford this with so many domestic issues, and i need a slurpee because my throat is sore from so much chanting' it's an issue that cannot be solved by slogans or 10 second sound-bites.  which is scary - because i don't know if this country knows how to solve complex problems -         "
"           I am not a 13th century BCE Hebrew.  Nor do I wish to be a citizen of a theocracy.  The notion that humans require a deity to identify and enforce ethical behavior is absurd.  Also, note that democracy emerged from pagans, not from Hebrews.  If one shouldn't burn the flag, can one burn a copy of the Constitution?  Or the Declaration of Independence?  Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?  Should one not discard it out the window of a car?  Should one not draw on it?  What if I draw on a painting of a flag?  Is a painting a flag?  Or is it only cloth?  Does plastic count?  Does it have to be a rectangle?  What of flag bookmarks?  Flag shot glasses?  Flag shirts, socks, hats?  What if I am angered by the discovery of something horrible that my country sanctioned, and I want to remove the flag sticker from my car -- should I wait until I've calmed down, so the act of disposing of the flag sticker won't be soiled by my mood at the time?  Here's a quandary:  All the people protesting in Great Britain today are encouraging those who committed the latest bombings in Turkey.  *Even* if they honestly don't think they're doing so!  Conundrum Corner indeed!  yelahneb:  If Iraqis feel that they can bicker amongst themselves, but if someone tells them what to do, they want none of it.  In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.

But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.  They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report.         "
"           i agree with eva - the burning  of the american flag will just turn people against your cause.   i would say, the best way to protest, is to not be violent or threatening - but rather peaceful, with a good solid message.   but most of all - don't say or insinuate that americans are stupid.  even americans who say americans are stupid don't want to hear from another country.

"           As I type, Mr Bush is having tea with the Queen a few miles away.  It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.  Oh, and I think most of the protestors will be from the UK, but there'll be be some from elsewhere, including plenty from the US, if experience serves.         "
"           They are expecting between 60,000-100,000 people at the protest tomorrow in London.  Nick and I will be there.  At the end of the march, they are going to be knocking down a 6 meter statue of George Bush.  Toppling over statues seems to be symbolic in the US media as the end of a regime, so I think it is very appropriate.  I came here to get away from George.  He followed me to St. Petersburg when I was living there and now he's followed me to England.  He needs to stop sweatin' me.  I mean, I know that I'm super cool and all, but damn!         "
"           NBC news this morning was reporting that the British were expecting 100,000 protestors during President Bush's visit.  They were a little vague leading up to that statement, talking about Bush's general unpopularity in Europe and something about a large (no percentage given) portion of the population supporting Bush.  On a sidenote, I just about fainted when an AIDS activist was complimentary of the Presidents record on AIDS - has hell started to freeze?  Anyway, my question is simple.  Are the 100,000 protestors from the UK or are they from all over western Europe?         "

"           Just read  urlLink that Village Voice article . Scary - I understand that similar legislation was proposed Europe-wide.  Maybe it even went through.  The definition they give for terrorists is pretty loose, don't you think?  To whit: 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means'-  which, pared down, could include pretty much anyone with an opinion, couldn't it?  I mean, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are a 'combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity' - and I'll bet they mean to achieve their nefarious ends 'through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means'... Mainly because 'other means' includes absolutely everything.  I'm going to call that 800 number and report them.

"            urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0346/otis.php  excerpt - ALEC's model legislation, drawn up by its 'Homeland Security Working Group,' is called the Animal and Ecological Terrorist Act, and it ostensibly focuses solely on groups like Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front, which have attacked homes and development projects that threatened the habitat of several species. But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

"           BTW, the toxoplasma stuff comes out in the news every few years with the intention of shocking pet owners.  'Oh, it's not my fault for being a slut...my cat has infected me with promiscuous disease.'  If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They 'evaluate' people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.  For now, the claims are total bollocks...   Off the subject, did anyone else think that the 'Matrices' were absolute shite?  Yuck!         "

"           Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.         "

"           from  urlLink The Straight Dope :   Dear Cecil:  I hear Jesus wasn't really a Capricorn but that he was either a Pisces or a Leo instead--that his birthday is observed in December because the Catholic Church took over the ancient Saturnalia debauch. What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles    urlLink Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

"           WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was  urlLink www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the  urlLink Mis-Lead .         "

It has been established now with LOTR that what appears in the theater is not the film, but a conscious abridgement.  It is not the finished work.  Take a moment and think about that:  the artist first publishes/presents a conscious abridgement of the actual work, agreed upon by all parties involved, who know and accept that what was really completed will be released in a different format in a few months.  Not a Director's Cut, not Lost Chapters, not a reassessment now that time has passed.  A conscious, fully intended abridgement.  Released first.         "

"           from a  urlLink transcript  of the interview with Diane Sawyer that JLS mentioned earlier:   Bush also defended the intelligence that he used in citing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a main reason for going to war. Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons 'programs' instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   ' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with.'    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, 'The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations',  what you *meant* was, 'The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?'  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

Really, how much skill does it take to talk out of both sides of your mouth like most politicians do?  To quote James Carville (Clinton's attack dog), 'It's the economy, stupid.'  If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.           "

"           Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

"           Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.         "
"           i think that most of the work to build up iraq should be given to iraqi companies or/and as many iraqis as possible should be employed for these projects.         "
"           Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.         "
"           Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         "

"           Yesterday (or Tuesday), Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination.  What caught my attention was the press reporting of it.  They said that Al Gore was a centrist Democrat and that Dean was much further left of him.  Do you agree with this?  If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.  But most importantly for the internet, because we all know that Al Gore invented the internet.         "
"           Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         "

"           Hmm.  I did not consider the multiple images of Neo to be the previous One.  I considered that they were merely images of what reaction the Matirx/Architect determined to be likely responses from Neo.         "
"           Note that in the monitors, the previous Neos all look the same.  Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.         "
"            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          "
"           Two cents:  I think the machines kept Neo alive for fear that if he died, another One would appear and the cycle would repeat.  Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.         "

"           If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?         "

"           This is why I don't trust the press to be fair in their reporting.  At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           "

"           Greetings from Zagreb!  Thought it would be fun to post from a little further away than usual.  I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.  The home page of the PC in my hotel is a hardcore porn site, which maybe isn't surprising for a Catholic country still in the throes of post-Communist freedom.  Nick         "

"           Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come.'   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming 'Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars.'           "
"           I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         "

One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my 'Rainbow Brite' LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've 'outgrown,' so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.

"           i think it would also be interesting to find out if traumatic experiences can actually effect our brain chemistry, long term.         "
"           That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.         "

"           My taste changes over time as well, though the recognition of objective quality (as I define it) remains constant.  It's probably more accurate to say what I 'like' changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.  If they happen rapidly for you, perhaps it is as I initially proposed -- that your relationship with art is largely, if not exclusively, personal and emotional.  In the context of this post, the heart changes more frequently than the mind.         "

"           Miriam -- From my observation of your reactions to movies and music over the years, I think it's safe to say that content is the key for you.  If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.         "
"           i have a question about movies. i didn't really like 'lost in translation' or 'american splendor' i've heard really good reviews but they didn't move me or change me or even really entertain me that much.  i have to say my favorite films of last year were in order: 1. return of the king 2. pirates of the carribean 3. terminator 3 and yes, that is kinda embarrassing to admit.  while i enjoy action/adventure films, and i realize that return of the king is more than that, it isn't normally my entire list.  i don't usually even enjoy mass-market films - so my question to anyone with an opinion about this is: why did you like lost in translation?  what was good about bill murray's performance?  -  why did you like american splendor?

"           Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?         "

"           I just found a strange contraption called Beagle II on my roof.  Should I tell someone?  About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?   urlLink Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.

I was merely referring to her presence on the blog (and in the e-mail ring prior to that) and therefore seeing my previous comments on the 2000 election.  As for the political differences, I guess I have never really felt that I have seen your opinions.  I have seen the links you post on the political issues, but I don't take that as necessarily that you agree 100% with them.  Much like if I was to post a link to the Weekly Standard or New Republic or whatever one of the conservative rags are, I doubt you would find that I agree with it 100%.  It also sounds like you feel like I did from the moment Clinton took office and declared me, a fresh college graduate making $29,000 a year to be rich.  From that moment on, I wanted that man out of office and would strongly argue against anything he said.  Miriam - I can't respond to most of your post without seriously offending some people personally, and I do not want to that.  Argue and attack the points, not the poster, so I won't.  The economy is a cyclical thing.  We had about 10 years of positive growth from the early 80's to early 90's, then a recession, then about 6-7 years of positive growth from 93-94 to early 2000.

"           john -  just on this point, i think we are no where near having a fully recovered economy, which of course, does not mean 0% unemployment, but it does mean that well-paying professional jobs are available for those who have the skills and education to acquire them.   eva - undergrad biology - unemployed.  ben - underemployed.  me - ba - contract work.   etc. etc. etc. - yes, we could all go out today and get a minumum wage job and barely scrape by and pay most of our bills.  but is that the american dream now?  get your education, work hard, and then stay around the poverty line due to a stalled economy?   what happened to all of the perks of full time employment?

"           'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.         "

Go USA!  Since we have so few problems, let's spend time and money on messing up another planet.  The thing that I find the funniest is the way Bush plans to fund it.

"           Ben - If that was intended as a response to my question, it failed.  I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.         "
"           MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          "
"           Thanks Mir, I was starting to wonder if I had fallen into an alternate reality where we agreed on things!  I am having fun watch the Democrats tear at each other in Iowa.  Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.         "

"           When I first heard that President Bush was going to propose going back to the Moon, I will admit that I was extremely skeptical on the reasoning.  We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?         "
"           Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.

"           Congratulations Miriam.  I was a little shocked to see that guy in what appears to be a serious movie.  I guess he is trying to expand beyond 'That 70s Show' and 'Dude, Where's My Car?'  Ben - Good article.  I did notread 100% of it (got a Cliff Notes version?) , but it reinforced my apprehension about Wal-Mart.  What I did not see it mention was what Wal-Mart has done to the smaller niche businesses.  You know, the ones like a bike shop or small fabric store or even an independent drug store (as versus CVS or Wal-Greens).  Do you recall the huge fight that Ashland put up against the Wal-Mart opening there?  It was very big news when they one, but the victory was only temporary.  The Wal-Mart is now open.  I have not heard how it has affected the small businesses in Ashland.  On the flip side, I am hypocritical for criticizing them.  With one salary and 5 mouths to feed, Julie does 80+% of our shopping at Wal-Mart, in part because of price and because of the convenence of going to one store and getting everything we need.  A recent trip included soap, diapers, an oil filter, and a gallon of milk.  There's not too many stores that have all four of those items           "

Back to my earlier comment about Bush being similar to Reagan (Teflon President), it seems this controversy is already dieing.  Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.  Another similarity is in one of O'Neill's claims of the President being disengaged during Cabinet meetings.  I seem to recall people saying Reagan was a doddering old fool in his Cabinet meetings.         "

"           jlg - Barring the religious aspect, I personally believe it comes down to two factors.  Machismo, and comfort.  Ma'cheese'mo - I think some guys are insecure and this is a way for them to be alpha of someone somewhere.  Also, in some cultures, like the Latino culture, it is almost bred into them to be gay haters.  And since that particular culture tends to be heavily Catholic....but we aren't going the religion route.  Comfort - If you are raised to believe that *all* dogs are mean killers.  You live 50 years of your life thinking that every dog you ever see is mean, and wants to kill you (versus nice and wants to kill you ;-p ).  Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.  If you believe that it is 'wrong' simply because that is what has been told to you since birth, then it will be hard to accept.         "

"           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         "
"           This is not ideology.  This is the Democratic Party trying to find something that will stick when attacking Bush.  Arguing over what happened (or did not happen) 30 years ago is just personal attacks.   The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!  Now if BOTH sides will let that happen, we might get to have civil discussions about our disagreements on the issues (taxes, spending, education, defense, etc.)          "

"           While quite a few pages still appear to be missing from the 1972 chapter of President Bushs National Guard duty in Texas and Alabama, at least a few of them may have been accounted for on Wednesday -- though not exactly in support of the administrations case that Bush fulfilled his service obligations. The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bushs Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bushs chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain theres not anything there that will embarrass the governor.   Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bushs file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.            "

"           seem like good and legitimate questions to me - anyone disagree or agree?  Joe Conason's Journal On Sunday, NBC's Tim Russert is scheduled to interview the president. Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.             "

Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is 'safe' to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.         "

"           Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals 'ought to have the same rights' (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

"           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            "

"           your faith in the chair is based on past experiences of sitting in a chair and it not falling apart.  if you were to be concerned every time this event occurred, you would have serious issues.  what these ladies were suggesting you have is 'blind' faith.  faith in something even though you have no evidence to support it - no previous experiences to draw from.  what you could assume, if it would make you less angry, is that these women believe with all of their heart, that their goal in life is to save you and if they don't, you will be suffering eternal torment.  hard for them to deal with, i'm sure.  they are just doing what they think is best.  i don't mind the proselytizers - as long as they don't try to change the laws of our secular government.         "
"           On a side note about 'faith'...  This past weekend, two ladies came to my door.  After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, 'Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?'.  My response was a prompt but polite 'No.'.  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         "
"           ...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film 'historically accurate', but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places 'really looked', which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling 'the greatest story ever told'?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.          "
"           For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant.  What matters to me are the words and the act(s).  My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.         "
"           I'm mixed on this aspect of the film.  While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.         "
"           The visuals are inspired by Medieval artwork and iconography, a stylistic choice.  I have no problem with that.         "
"           It is quite likely that Jesus was a 'white guy'.  Now he probably didn't look like he was from Sweden, but rather he looked more like a modern day Middle Easterner.  Like Iraqis, Pakistanis, Israelis, etc.  And yes, they are considered Caucasians.  As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.  Now I find that almost impossible to believe that back then being that close to Africa that not a single black person was present in that city during that time.         "
"           i was almost curious enough about 'the passion' to give a look.  i was intrigued by the desire on gibson's part for historical accuracy on depicting the time period in which the story is set; the sets, the costumes, even the language - a film in aramaic, of all things!    then i checked out the  urlLink official site  for the film.  jesus christ is played by a white guy, as is most of the cast.  wtf.

"           when i read things like this i don't know whether to laugh or cry: Ga. school evolution debate goes to trial    April 6, 2004  |  ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a school district's practice of posting disclaimers inside science textbooks saying evolution is 'a theory, not a fact.'   The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.             "

"           I found some interesting tidbits while researching the election stuff.  Does anyone have a guess when the last time Virginia voted for a Democrat was?  It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.

"           For the record, I went back and checked the official FEC results of the 2000 election.  If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.         "

'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         "

Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            "

We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com           "
"           from the new republic, july 8 [as previously blogged]:  ... a third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis 'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.' What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: 'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.' Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.   what happens today?

"            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.

"           John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.         "

"           Johnathan - On the healthcare issue, assuming that the two are mutually exclusive (and I certainly do not believe that are and hope they are not), which would you prefer to have - high quality or affordable healthcare?  As for absolutes, I think you (collective) have to have them to make decisions.  You either think something is right or wrong.  You believe something or you don't.  You think something is true or false.  I would bet that you (Johnathan) have more absolutes than realize, and that they help you form your outlook on life and opinion of things.  I think a strong leader has to see the world in absolutes, or else they are not strong.  Whether you agree with that leader is a reflection of your personal absolutes and how they compare with his (or hers).         "

"           Luc -- People vote for the individual who will most likely represent what they value.  If it is impossible to imagine someone who might legitimately value a different thing than you, then most likely you perceive a universe of absolutes.  Thus, in a matter of speaking, you are a believer.  Which brings us back to your previous posting, which compared a believer to one who is drunk.  So perhaps you cannot fathom someone voting for Bush because you're drunk.         "
"           I will ask you the similar question.  Why would anyone vote  for  John Kerry?  I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.             "

"            concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.

The files depict a prison in complete chaos.

Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election.

"           Saturn Infolabs goes global by placing a central point for customer support and market expansion in the Middle East at Dubai.  Dubai embraces a wide variety of scenery in a very small area. In a single day, the tourist can experience everything from rugged mountains and awe-inspiring sand dunes to sandy beaches and lush green parks, from dusty villages to luxurious residential districts and from ancient houses with windtowers to ultra-modern shopping malls.  The emirate is both a dynamic international business centre and a laid-back tourist escape; a city where the sophistication of the 21st century walks hand in hand with the simplicity of a bygone era.  But these contrasts give Dubai its unique flavour and personality; a cosmopolitan society with an international lifestyle, yet with a culture deeply rooted in the Islamic traditions of Arabia.  Since earliest times, Dubai has been a meeting place, bringing together the Bedouin of the desert interior with the pearl-diver, the merchant of the city with the sea-going fisherman.   Having expanded along both banks of the Creek, Dubai’s central business district is divided into two parts — Deira on the northern side and Bur Dubai to the south — connected by a tunnel and two bridges. Each has its share of fine mosques and busy souks, of public buildings, shopping malls, hotels, office towers, banks, hospitals, schools, apartments and villas.  Outside this core, the city extends to the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah to the north, while extending south and west in a long ribbon of development alongside the Gulf, through the districts of Satwa, Jumeirah and Umm Suqeim.  &raquo; read more  urlLink http://www.saturninfolabs.com          "
