"             Ok get this, I call Apple and the laptop is back in action. Joyus beyond belief I rush there and pick up the laptop. I am told I have maxed the bitch out. Upon returning home, I go and transfer a ton of files to the tower computer, which is pretty much maxed out as well. Everything works in it ecxept of course for Cubase. I'm just happy to have my baby back. Then I go out for a few hours come back, and around about midnight, while moving some files out of it, it crashes again. I almost crapped myself with disgust. Of course this happen when I'm leaving for Chicago tomorrow and LA on Tuesday. I can't win.  I'm off to apple literally right now. Bastards.  F         "
"             I'm off to Chicago this weekend to lend a hand to Jared as work continues on the new Chemlab record. I havent seen Jared in a year, so that will be great, and any excuse to see the Cracknation family is a welcome one. This record is coming along nicely, I might add...  The hard-drive in my laptop decided to take a dive yesterday, but luckily I had mailed all my work on the album to Jason (Novak, my dear friend of cracknation.com fame, and producer of the chemlab album) before all this crap went down. I would have been in MUCH worse of a mood if it wasnt for Ash consoling me and then Signficiant Other coming home and getting me out of the house for Tapas (thanks G) and a trip to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Fortunately, any pending music work, including a remix of Pigface, was already finished or stored in my home computer. Fate of said laptop to be determined tomorrow. rrrrrrr.  Last night, I went to see the play SALOME, starring Al Pacino, with everyones favorite college graduate, The Kidd. Pacino was hilarious and Marisa Tomei topless was worth the price of admission.   F         "
"             Welcome to MOGworld...         "
"             Focused (read: the boring process of burning cd's) at the moment  on the next aggression EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS, which by the way, is my all time favorite aggression song. Ash's single mix so far is really hot. Lotta warmth to it. Remix kits are going out now. We've got the British , we've got the Russians, we have a few New Yorkers, and maybe even some midwesterner's remixing. And to top it off, we have a cover picture from Iceland. You can't get more international than that. Maybe it will come out this year. Maybe ;-)  F         "
"             My former neighbor John Cale has a new EP out called '5 Tracks' which I believe is a precursor to a full length album due out early next year. This is great stuff. Anyone who is interested in something different, interesting and catchy should snag this. He's a tad grumpy in real life (he once almost kung fu kicked Chris Connelly), but he's a fantastic musician, who, like his former bandmate Lou Reed, seems to improve with age (not counting Reed's dumbass Edgar Allan Poe thing). 'FRAGMENTS OF A RAINY SEASON' remains one of my all time favorite CD's. Many moons ago, Chris Link made Dr. Fury and I go see Cale at NYU while he was touring for 'FRAGMENTS' and to say it was one of the best things I ever saw would be selling it way too short. I've seen the man perform dozens of times since and he never ever once failed to be incredible. To my knowledge he hasn't peformed here in NYC for quite some time, but when he comes, it's an absolute must see.  I have asked some of my other MOGpac members to post on this board about their likes/dislikes of all things music/film/books etc, cause honestly, I am bored reading myself. We all have such diverse tastes that I'm sure anyone who reads this as it progresses will wonder how we all haven't killed each other yet.  In the meantime, I have started preparations for the new aggression remix EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS. Remix kits are finally going out. I'm hoping to get a few Russians on this one, cause the Russians, you know, GET IT.  F         "
"             Acumen brought the pain to NYC and the way I am feeling this morning, the pain has been brought. First off, thanks to The Significant Other for putting up with the madness even though she had to be at work at 7am this morning. She probably doesn't read this, but she is appreciated. Having 5 guys crash in our tiny pad is not the most logical or easy.  Because of the graduation party for Ciao Baby and his sister, S.O. and I were late for the acu-gig. We missed the DJA? set, but got the full brunt of the rawk. I was quite pleased with the set list, especially since they played my old favorite, fuckface, which came out around the time the acumen/aggression (back when it was me and PH) pally-dom started. Such memories. I think. Anyway, the new songs are good and despite the lack of the ILC material, I was happy to see them for what they will never understand was a good and appreciative crowd for NYC. Also, I remain a huge fan of the Acumen rythmn section. Dan Brill blows my mind on drums and I'm not just saying that because he was sporting an aggression T-shirt onstage. He's no Robin though, but someday maybe he can try to be as good ;-)....  It was nice to see some familiar faces, like the kids from the message boards and thanks to Aaron the Pak for buying Irene and I some drinks. It took him 7 years to get around to it, but he did it, even though he is from a town made fun of on Sex In the City. the shock of the night was running into Charlie from Form, who just moved to NY from Dayton (Charlie and his bandmate Paul did a great remix for us on our newest single). And to Charlie, also, thanks for the drink.  Late night drinks were had locally, which of course led to the usual debates/discussions/rows, etc. and which of course leads to the one thing men need in the morning..Egg bitches. You can email Jason Novak about that one.  And now, a round of apologies....  First, to Matt Gentile. Acumen played 'Gun Lover'. I was told they weren't going to. Forgive me. it was good.  Second, to Ryan 'The Sarcastic Bastard', who drank sour low fat milk in my house. I can't feel THAT sorry for Ryan as he CHOSE to be the merch guy for Acumen. That's masochism enough. No wonder why he's drinking whiskey at 11 in the morning.  Ok, gotta clean this place up now. rrrrr.  F           "
"             Back from another trip to LA...saw Saintface last night at their biggest gig to date at the Mercury Lounge. Though they might argue, the gig was a success. Good crowd, band was tight, Peter's voice was in fine shape. They have new song called 'There Is a Room' that is really solid. However, someone needs to convince my friend Peter Saintface to record a goddamn album already. The man has 4 albums worth of songs and only has 1 EP out. Leaving these gigs without having the songs at home to listen to makes me freaking mental. The person who convinces him to record an album gets a free drink from me (and Dorigen)...  Going back and forth with Jared on the new round of Chemlab demos, which I have just received. It's getting there. I think the record is at that point where it's a few weeks away from being great (and finished)...Jason/Jamie are now on tour, which gives Jared some time to go and record some more vox and think about changes, etc. I'm a big fan of this album. I'm gonna try and do some last minute synth parts before Jason and co. come to stay at MOGworld when their tour hits NY this weekend.  In other news, the hypefactor live experience is currently being pondered...Since there are only 6 HF songs, I'm throwing around eclectic ideas from the days of MOG past. Kudzu Rail anyone?  Live wresting at MSG next week, TWO nights in a row, God Bless you Matt Gentile.  F           "
"             Still out of it from the Chicago trip. Lotta work, too little sleep. I was literally in the studio till the cab picked me up from the airport. Jared seems happy with the results, which obviously is a good indiciation of where this is going. Meanwhile, Significant Other and I saw FINDING NEMO, which is quite good and touching. I was surprised by its 'adult' issues (death, single parenting, handicaps, etc.). I admit I got a lil choked up and S.O. found herself crying every 5 minutes. The animation is blow away. I still like MONSTERS INC. better.  Off to LA tomorrow for 10 days.   F         "
"             Almost 3am here in Chicago...tired, beat, exhausted, and all things like that. Day two of Chemlab sessions have gone extremely well. We just spent the last few hours recording Greg 'Slo' Hand' Lucas on the guitar. He's adding that dirty chem guitar sound that the kids love. Jared jumps for joy. Jamie, Jared, and I took a section of a song omitted from the album and turned it into some chemlab goodness. Maybe it will make it onto the album. Jared's voice is in fine shape, he's two songs and a few overdubs away from wrapping the vox up for this beeyotch. Phrase of the day is 'Velveteen Pouch'. Don't ask. Crackhouse is always a fun place to hang out and work and the Novak/Brittion clan are excellent hosts who take good care of their guests. And yes, the new Acumen record is as dirty and nasty and as hard as Jason promised. My poor ears. Good friends, good times, good music being made...home tomorrow.  F         "
"             A brief hypefactor update: I spent the past two days writing choruses and tracking guitars for two hype songs, although I cannot tell you which ones because I haven't a clue about song titles yet. I can say with certainty that one of them is  not  the track mentioned earlier by F.J.: 'They've Just' ('They've just... what?' I ask.)  I have a feeling that one may be rejected, or removed and used as a new track in its own right, but we shall see this weekend.  One element of the new recordings that diverges wildly from 'The Distracted Lover' is the amount of production and layering going on in the songs, especially in terms of the live instruments. For one track - a slower, funkier number with a brooding verse - I layered seven tracks of guitar on the chorus alone, from acoustics to 12-strings to a harmonized six string. This practice, while complex, thickens up the sound, adds texture with multiple instruments and incorporates new melodies into an otherwise straightforward riff.  After I write the basic tune for a track, I put on a pair of headphones and listen to the song on repeat, searching for gaps in the part that can be filled in with new melodies and riffs. The listener will rarely be able to pick out an individual part when listening to the completed track, but each contributes to the melody, however subtley.  I am in the middle of writing a retrospective of  urlLink 'The Distracted Lover'  recording sessions for the  urlLink hypefactor Web site , much of it focusing on the creative process and the progression of each song. To jog my memory, I listened to the record on repeat while writing, and I am amazed at times by the sonic simplicity of the entire EP, both to its benefit and detriment. During the 2001 sessions - my first major undertaking as an engineer and songwriter - we rarely multitracked any individual instrument more than twice. While this was not a conscious choice (and more a product of our own inexperience), it ultimately complimented the song structures, which were simplistic to begin with. This time around, however, everyone in the hype gang is striving for something less obvious: melodies up front, but bolstered by highly experimental production. Sound design in particular has become a major part of the process, with F.J. leading the charge.  While I am on the subject of musical sophistication, I have a few words about  urlLink Gustavo Cerati . First, this is a man whose production values have grown exponentially throughout his career, and never once at the expense of solid songwriting. If you listen to his most recent solo work -  urlLink 'Siempre Es Hoy'  and  urlLink 'Bocanada'  - you will understand what I mean. The songs have infinite sonic depth, layering part upon part upon part, and always to the benefit of the basic melody. Were there a Frederick Law Olmstead of music, Cerati would be it; his simple, engaging songs rarely belie the great technical sophistication behind their creation.  While watching Cerati live at Webster Hall on Wednesday night, I was amazed that his band - two keyboardists, a female singer, a bassist and a drummer - succeeded in replicating a great deal of that complex production live. Every effort was made to properly play the album live while also adding new sounds and melodies. The moody 'Bocanada' material was notably elegant as Cerati and band completely recast those tracks in a rock framework. I cannot wait for the bootlegs of this tour. Viva!         "
"             All you have to do is read my previous Cerati review and apply it to last night here in NYC, with a few noted changes:  1. You would think with the amount of money Webster Hall rakes in thanks to the millions of tourists, Long Islanders and Tunnell People they bring it weekly, the could turn on the freaking aircon.  2. Crowd was MUCH better than LA, a rarity in NYC.  3. Cerati thankfully didn't play the rap song from his album, which would have sent Ash home screaming bloody murder.   4. He altered the middle part of his set to fit on some more reworkings from his previous record Bocanada. Ace.  I'm glad Ash and B got to see this so they have a good understanding as to where I am at in my head musically.  Meanwhile, Chemlab should be done as I type. Looking forward to the final mixes, track order, etc. Now the fun beings. Web site and merch are discussed with Louche  And finally, back to HF2, which has been itching at me. Lots of new plug ins, courtesy of Ash for me to play with in Cubase. FUN.  F         "
"             Lots of catching up today...  Chemlab is in the home stretch. It's down to a few days, for real. Jared is at work with the Crackers to tweak and settle on a tracklisting. My views on that are in. In the meantime, the powers that be at the label have given the album a big thumbs up after hearing the bulk of it.  Now the business begins, so it's emails and phone calls the bulk of the day. OXIDIZER is now slated for either the third or fourth week in October. There is initial discussion about a track appearing on a compilation, though that's not confirmed. It might possibly end up being the machine porn epic SCORNOCOPIA or the in your face rollercoaster rocker PULSE (aka WHITE ROOM BLACK NOISE though we're not sure which title to use yet).   I've asked Ash to get involved on an aggression remix for Chemlab, not just because I know he would do something incredible, but because I'd love to see Ash get his hands dirty in the machine world for a bit. I need to get him hooked back to a computer and away from guitars just for a bit.  Defcon Gilez (my pal and promoter of our UK extravaganza in 01) informs me the band he manages, Needleye, are remixing the aggression and could have something in a few weeks. These guys are hard and nasty. They are hurrying to wrap it up because have just drafted in a producer of some noteriety, also a friend of mine (and well known to industrial fans around the world and known especially to my advisor/lawyer/agent), to produce their new demo. I can't say who though!  I'm a man of many secrets, sorry. the only reason I get to hear this stuff (and keep my day job) is because I'm good at keep it secret.   It's no secret that Cerati is tomorrow night!  F          "
"             Back home at last...But I  would like to vent against Apple and their hardware for a moment. How the HELL could they make a laptop battery that lasts only a few hours? This obviously was not designed for the bi-coastal types such as myself. Thousands of feet in the air, somewhere in the middle of the US today, I was in full swing on a new HF song called (at this moment) 'THEY'VE JUST...'. It has some haunting acoustic fingerpicking by Ms. Emmett, some broken beats courtsey of Baby B and Ash, and some melodic bassness from yours truly. Simple and moving. Anyhoo, I was just hitting my stride with the song , and the damn battery runs out. Time FLIES. I was so pissed. Luckily, S.O. was on hand to make sure the flight attendants provided me with enough tea to last the rest of the flight.  Apple, you can make a 30 gig freakin' Ipod, why can't you make a 4-5 hour battery? Douches!  Because of my bicoastal travels, Louche and I miss each other via Email today. He is in Chicago handling 'the details', which I think is the nice way of saying 'the record label bullshit'. There are certain matters that need my attention, I'm told. I had a stop-over in Cleavland and while I honestly have no clue as to where Cleavland is in proximity to Chicago, I was tempted to just say fuck all and head over to Cracknation. But honestly, I am glad NOT to be part of 'the details'. Jared informs me that the thing I was concerned about in my previous MOGblog update is not the case, but I await the full story. I think there is some last minute manuevering to throw some more on the album, which has a firm cut off in the can deadline of...um...'sometime this week'. It all depends on how much 'wiggle room' there is. Look, if it makes the album better, go for it, I say. In the meantime, I am told Inivisible is quite 'hot' for the new Chemlab album, now all they have to do is promote the shit out of it and treat it like the event it is. This album is a blockbuster and the second Summer of Hate is upon us (even though the record comes out this fall).  I have agreed to do a remix for my pals in K-NITRATE. However, I will not be remixing K-Nitrate, but will be remixing their side-project Audio War, which I have never heard, but I am sure is loud and nasty. Could be good! The Russians have sent me a note letting me know they are hard at work on thier aggression remix. I am salivating for that one cause I think it will be amazing if they do it the way I think they will!  I have come home to find Cerati tickets waiting for me. He plays here in NYC on Wed. Thank God!  F         "
"             It’s no secret that I have a tendency to exaggerate a bit, hence the origin of the name Hypefactor (though that’s for another time). However, I am not exaggerating when I write that the seeing the Gustavo Cerati gig here in LA last night was a life changing experience. Lv23 (who redefines DANCE FEVER), Bradley J. Fox and I were all were blown away.  I wont get too deep into it, but quite frankly, the man is a genius. He has an uncanny ability to write incredible and emotional songs that perfectly marry modern electronics to rock instruments and pop structure. It was a flawless 2-hour performance .The Palace here in LA has a REALLY large stage, so Cerati was able to take full advantage of the space. He was enthusiastic and animated  and seemed to genuinely enjoy himself. He is such a thrilling musician to watch and is an incredible guitarist. You can’t help but be drawn in. He’s retained most of his excellent band of young musicians from the last tour (including his multi-talented sidekick, Falvius) and they were incredibly tight . Together, they were able to push the current songs to new heights while redefining the old songs to fit the current Cerati sound. It also helps to have a very young and hot back up singer (who I’m told is Cerati’s MUCH younger girlfriend…brilliant) to make sure the lads pay attention. It’s also the first time I have seen a drummer almost as incredible as mine. Everything about this show was first class and the music, as always, was inspiring. These guys are used to playing arenas in other parts of the world, and the entire presentation and dedication to perfection reflects that. Lv23 went to soundcheck and confirmed our belief that Cerati is a TYRANT when it comes to making everything sound perfect. He even went up to the soundbooth to mix certain things himself when he was unhappy with the mix.   Unfortunately, there is one thing that Ash will hate in the set, and I intend to ask him to get me a drink or something at Webster hall next week when I know this particular song is about to start.  For someone who has been in the business over 20 years, Gustavo Cerati continues to evolve and in my eyes, can do no wrong. In the same way seeing Revenge in 1989, the Sisters in 1991 and Ministry in 1992 effected me so significantly at 20, Gustavo Cerati defines the musical path I choose to make in at 30.   In other news, Oxidizer has taken an interesting turn and might possible have a last minute guest appearance. I don’t know if I necessarily agree with this move, but we have to see how it plays out. Jared might be in Chicago by the time you read this sorting through everything. When talking to the producer today, I complimented him on the programming in a song called SCORNOCOPIA, a song I thought I had nothing to do with the writing of. He then informed me that it was I who did the programming that started the song and the melody was mine. This instance of me forgetting something like that is not an isolated incident. This happened I think on the first HF CD as well. I would walk into the studio and say “man, I love that, good job!” and then be told I did the part a week before. Do I have musical Alzheimers? Shit!  F  P.S. I wish I had seen Dave Gahan in NYC just to have something new to argue about with your Saintface Comrades ;-)         "
"             As an addendum to my comrade Matt's post about Saintface, via the American Heritage Dictionary...  wan·der·lust n.   A very strong or irresistible impulse to travel. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [German  : wandern, to wander (from Middle High German) + Lust, desire (from Middle High German, from Old High German. See las- in Indo-European Roots).]         "
"             One of the common denominators among the members of the MOGpac is that we are drawn to new music by performers who have been at the game for the better part of twenty years. The music industry being what it is in 2003 - and excuse me for being  that guy  who believes there are fewer and fewer significant new artists being promoted in this age - much of our discussion revolves around performers from the 1980s and 1990s that are still releasing solid recordings.  There are risks involved in this practice, namely, severe disappointment (example: 2002's 'Release' by the Pet Shop Boys.) But there are plenty of veterans out there writing material that is passable, charming, even brilliant ('Music of the Spheres' by Ian 'Auto Tune' Brown.)  Dave Gahan, the Depeche Mode singer-turned-solo artist, is no slouch performer or singer. But 'Paper Monsters' - his solo debut recorded while on hiatus from the Mode - proves that Dave can write a convincing pop album on his own terms. So convincing, in fact, that Martin Gore would be a dunderhead if he relegated Dave to the vocal booth on the next Mode record.  Based on 'Papers Monsters' and Dave in concert - Matt and I had the pleasure of seeing him at the Hammerstein Ballroom yesterday, along with a  severely  intoxicated crowd - I would go so far as to argue that the solo Dave Gahan delivered what Depeche and bands of their ilk should have been doing for the past six years. The record is dark and intoxicating, the show is rowdy and defiant, and the whole package is cast in the form of stunning songwriting and production.  Dodgy lyrics aside, Dave on record is everything only hinted at in modern Depeche: brooding ('Hidden Houses'), romantic ('Stay'), sage ('Hold On.) It works alone with a bottle of red wine, or when your S.O. is in for the evening.  To stunning effect, 'Paper Monsters' live is exactly what it should be: a rawk 'n' roll show. The uptempo numbers are booming, raucous affairs with Dave dominating the stage, while the album's moodier tracks are steamrollers, slowly building to a crescendo. Much like Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Dave's newfound physical and mental health grounded the show - he looks alive, youthful, energized - and his band feeds off the energy of a 41-year-old man convincingly acting 21 on stage.  To be noted: Dave even managed to enrich Mode standards - 'Never Let Me Down Again,' 'A Question Of Time,' 'Personal Jesus' - that have had the life beaten out of them by retro radio, DJs and the band themselves. The dancefloor reinterpreted by a rock band. Synthpop this was not.  The watershed point of the show, however, was the second encore: Mode classics played on stand-up bass, acoustic 12-string guitar, acoustic drums and keyboards. Suddenly, 'Enjoy The Silence' didn't sound dated anymore. Regardless of what you think of 'Paper Monsters,' Dave deserves credit for single-handedly reinvigorating his band's back catalogue.         "
"             I'm burning new Chem-Mixes now again. Ive been through more blank discs than I own CD's this week. I can't write any more about how much I love this album, cause it's all I write about. i want you all to have it...  Today, Grandpa Al makes Grandpa Factor's day when he writes on his website: 'WE START ON THE COCKS AND MINISTRY CD'S IN THE STUDIO STARTING AROUND AUG.15 (PRE-PRODUCTION) WE HAVE CONFIRMATIONS FROM: OGRE, GIBBY HAYNES,CHRIS CONNELY, LUC VAN ACKER, AND OF COURSE, PAUL, LOUIS, MIKEY, MAX, REY, AND MYSELF.  WE ALSO ARE GETTING LUXA PAN RECORDS UP AND RUNNING TO RELEASE A LOT OF THE OUT OF PRINT STUFF. (PAIL HEAD, 1000 HOMO DJ'S, OLD COCKS, ACID HORSE, BLACKOUTS ETC. ETC. ETC.)'  I just literally had two conversations with two different people about how they should be doing this shit. Well done Al!  Cerati tomorrow. It's gonna own like no other.  F         "
"             Unfortunately, Raw at the Staples Center didn’t happen last night, but after a Looooong weekend at the San Diego Comic Con, I need all the rest I can get. 70,000 people and half a million square feet of Comic Con over the course of 4 days can be very draining. Poor S.O. has to deal with a ton of new toys and such in the apt, but I made sure that some of my purchases were NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS related (it’s like her favorite film EVER).  For you genre film buffs, you may have read about a fan-film called BATMAN: DEAD END, which had quite possibly the biggest non-studio buzz at the Con. It was all over the net that this was the “best Batman film ever made” and that perennial fanboy demi-gods Kevin Smith and Alex Ross gave it their stamps of approval. A still leaked to the Internet looked just like Alex Ross’ interpretation of Batman. Naturally, my curiosity was piqued, so I set out to see this alleged “masterpiece”. Well, needless to say, it was quite the letdown, not because it’s bad, but because it is basically a costume/monster/fx reel for some commercial directors, not an actual three-act film. It’s like a student film with an unlimited budget. What they don’t mention is that it’s Batman vs. Aliens vs. Predator and an excuse to show-off the crew’s talents as a creature shop. I found it laughable, honestly, though the hundred plus fan boys and girls cheered as if Jesus had risen from the grave in front of them. Snooze. My suggestion is to buy the animated MYSTERY OF THE BATWOMAN DVD later this year to get a good Bat-fix. However, if you want to see DEAD END, check it out at:  http://www.theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/batman_deadend/  Finally got around to start working on Hypefactor today. The process is slow and I don’t see it picking up in it’s pace, really. We’re writing some very complex stuff and the bulk of my time is sorting through the many different guitar and bass parts to see what works best together. It’s a fun process, especially when you have such a rich amount of material to choose from, but it’s certainly time consuming. Also, I don’t want to rush this one; I want to be able to make sure I deliver a solid first round of arrangements.  In other news, the latest (and almost last) round of Chem-mixes has come in from Cracknation. This was the biggest bulk of new mixes in quite some time, so there is quite a lot to absorb. What’s most interesting about these new mixes is how the crackteam has pushed the machine rock envelope to a new level. The record is very warm, but chock full of machine manipulation. It’s gotten into that weird twisted cyber territory…and I mean that in a good way. Jared is flying into Chicago this week to wrap it up with the boys. I, however, will remain in LA before heading back to NYC next week, which is smart anyways, as too many cooks in the kitchen at such a crucial point could be counter-productive and quite honestly, based on what I have heard so far, I don’t think I could add much as they seem to have it nailed.  For the record, I played a recent rough version of the album for my lawyer/agent/advisor who back in the day was an advisor and trusted confidant of the lab and she was blown away by Oxidizer’s “chemlab-ness”. This is a huge vote of confidence, cause if it sucked, or didn’t sound like Chemlab, she would be the first to tell us.  Cerati in 2 days. Too good.  F          "
"             My 'lovely underage girlfriend' and I were the sole MOGpackers to represent the most recent Saintface show on Saturday day night.  The gig was held in what used to be known as the 'the Cooler' on 14th btw 9th and Washington (sidenote: my only memory of the Cooler was an AFI gig I was supposed to see there in November, 1999.  I was so anxious for that show as it would have been the first time in two years that i had seen them.  Unfortunately, I never made it to the show.  I had gone home after work and was halfway out my door when I received a phone call from then recent ex-gf, who since is being referred to as 'the hussy'.  She started a fight and held me up just long enough to have to miss the show.  I then had to resort to seeing AFI the following night in SUFFOLK COUNTY at a biker bar.  That's a whole other story.  But upon seeing how small and nicely set up the COoler is, I was angered all over again...feeling 21 again...something that my lovely companion cannot claim.).  The space is set up in a very cool way.  Decent size stage that is rather low to the ground, couches and stools in the actual performance area; a separate bar area (yes Frank, they had Stella); and a totally separate lounge type area.  Very cool space.  My companion and I got to the venue at 11.30, just to time to catch the last two songs of the final support act, The New Years.  I have to say - I liked them.  Their look definitely needs polishing (bass player was sporting a sleeveless t (surfer style) and an eyebrow ring), but the sound was pretty good - hipster rock with more of an edge and even the occasional post-hardcore drone.  I look forward to checking them out again.  For the main event, Peter Saintface made sure he wouldn't remember it.  Aside from that the band was tight playing mostly new tracks probably heard at the Mercury Lounge gig a few weeks back (by the by - they're back there in August - on a Saturday night.  Well done!), and included one entirely new 'under-rehearsed' track.  I wish I could describe it for you but I'm too tried.  The set overall was very good eventhough I don't get to hear my faves from back in the '00.  One lighter point of the evening: two Poontang girls made an appearance along with some Dutch dude who was there to have 'fun!'.  No names, but when Peter sang a few words and pointed to one IP gal, she swooned hardcore.  When the same happened to me, I felt overwhelmed with wanderlust.  Dave Gahan on Wednesday night.  Looking forward.  Scary thing about this show: I checked ticketbastard.com this morning and tix were still available on the floor of the Hammerstein!!!  Crazy, but he apparently plays some fun stuff, so I am excited.  'til the end' M.         "
"             I waited a few days before posting this, but the other night my lawyer/agent/advisor and I ventured to an obscure  part of California called Costa Mesa to see the reunited original 5-piece Duran Duran in what was supposed to be their first US show in 18 years (unfortunately they threw in a club gig in LA the night before, thus making this the SECOND gig in the US in 18 years).  It is no secret that Duran Duran are the first band I was ever a true fan of quite possibly the most important band in my life. And perhaps, with the exception of Skrew, believe it or not, I have seen Duran Duran more than any band. However, I never saw the original lineup as I was too young, so my first experience seeing Duran Duran live, was the NOTORIOUS era 3-piece line up at Madison Square Garden in 1987 (also the first for my lawyer/agent/advisor, though I didn't know her then!). For those of you old enough to remember, being a male duran duran fan in the 1980's was about as cool as being pro-hitler in the 1940's. Branded a 'fag', 'homo' or anything else for years as a teenager because I didn't love Motley Crue or Twisted Sister, I as Dan Hamill will attest, remained a loyal Duran Duran fan for 2 decades. And I never waivered once.  So obviously this gig in Costa Mesa was important to us. I'm not even sure what my expectations were, but they were shattered and surpassed by the third song (mostly cause the sound blew until that point, but I chalk that up to being in an outdoor amphitheatre). I realized that at that point that for the past 18 years I have seen nothing but Duran Duran cover bands, cause THIS is the real deal.  First, I was shocked at how good they look (always important), but nothing could prepare me for the incredible chemistry the original line up has and tremendous talent that the two members I had never seen perform, Andy and Roger Taylor, have oozing out of them. What they bring to the table is unbelievavle.   It also no secret that to me John Taylor, co-founder of Duran Duran, is without a doubt THE single most underrated bassist of his generation (and inadvertanty inspired the 'Factor' name. Now reunited with Roger Taylor, his spirtual other half, the Duran rythmn section is second to none. I had been hoping since the day he left Duran in 1997 that John Taylor would return to the fold, and seeing him here made realize that he is the heart and soul of the band. And it's biggest fan. Every band needs that member who is unconditional in their love for the band. I can relate.  They played the hits, they played album tracks such as NEW RELIGION and CARELESS MEMORIES with the energy that musicians half their age couldn't muster, and they played new songs that potentially rival the best of their back catalog. They also played some hits from their post Andy/Roger period and again, the two returning members added their own unique touches to songs such as COME UNDONE and ORDINARY WORLD that were fantastic.   And did I mention how good they look?  Back in New York recently, the VH1 'I LOVE THE 80'S' (I DONT love the 80's btw) poked fun at the alleged limited keyboard playing skills of Nick Rhodes, which only goes to show how stupid people are. Nick Rhodes pretty much invented the Duran 'sound'. When SAVE A PRAYER starts, and thousands of people swoon, who do you think created those synth sounds that tug at your heart and make you a big pile of mush? Genius. That I say Fuck You to the singer out of Def Leppard who wishes he had a quarter of Nick Rhodes' talent. Pour some sugar on THIS, you bitch.  I don't wanna even get into the brilliance of Simon LeBon, who's voice has improved tremendously over the years and represents a lost generation of uninhibited, sexy frontmen who combine talent with charisma to cast a spell over their audience. He has charisma to spare and is full on.  By the 3rd song I realized we were seeing something very very special. By the encore, my lawyer/advisor/agent said to me 'what MORE can they do?' and yet they do even more. These guys are playing for keeps and are very obviously determined to cement their legacy. I have never seen a band like this before. There is a reason this band has sold 70 million records. This isn't a comeback, this is something beyond that. It's not nostalgic. I don't know what this is, but this was one of the best gigs I have ever seen.  F         "
"             Literally. As I type this at 4:40 a.m. on Tuesday, I am burning discs of the new hypefactor sessions for F.J. to work on during his two-week California sojurn. This is the beauty of the modern home recording system - provided that he has the necessary files, F.J. can mix, modify and arrange any work we do in the studio while he is traveling or out of town. When flying, the majority of us sleep or watch 'Miss Congeniality' on the in-flight movie. The ever-efficient F.J., on the other hand, mixes. By the time he and I are both back in the same ZIP code, there will be a whole slew of changes and things will develop from there.  Conveniently, I am off to Chicago tomorrow for a week-long holiday with a couple of the crew from school. I'll have copies of the new material along so that I can write more guitar parts at home, which will then be recorded and fleshed out in New York come the end of July.  After Monday night's session, I began the tedious process of editing the new material and programming some drum loops. The synthetic drums are often the most difficult element to get right in a song's backing track. The reason: They must suit the song's purpose  and  be completely unique in tone and character. Dance music being, well, everywhere, the bar has been raised for rhythms because the tired ones are embarassingly obvious (hinting at laziness on the producer or programmer's part.) But the great ones - here I'll cite Telefon Tel Aviv, a current hypefactor favorite - stick in your head as much as a shimmering guitar hook.  The time-consuming editing process is a significant departure from The Distracted Lover sessions at Sauna (my old apartment on Water Street at the Fulton Fish Market.) When F.J. and I met after pre-production in June 2001 to share our material, the arrangements of the five songs we chose to record changed very little during the next year. As a result, we only recorded what was needed - there was almost nothing in the way of extraneous takes or arrangement concepts. This time around, however, neither of us brought finished songs to the table at the start of the recording process. The six embryonic songs with which we are working emerged from hours of jamming in the studio, all of which was recorded direct to disk. As a result, a single song may have hundreds of takes and structural ideas associated with it, all of which will be picked through at some point.  I have more to tell about Monday night's session, but I'll post about that after my flight and a belated Bastille Day celebration in Chicago. And for you squeamish types who never tried steak tartare, get over it!         "
"             Guess, what? Today, I was invited to come play on my solo record. How cool is that? I get a call from Ash telling me he's going into the studio to work on my album and I'm more than welcome to come. Jesus, ok. Thanks for the invite (I mean that in good fun).  As I type, Ash and Brandt are working on guitar parts for our more Cerati sounding track. Ash is giving us those dreamy e-bows that I love and Brandt is....Marring the song up a bit, if you know what I mean. I wanted this to be a rocker, but they are pulling it into a very cool direction.   I, having recorded my bass and guitar parts for this particular tune, get to stare at some wrestling while listening to the lads record. The last time I did something similar, the song 'J-BAR' was written, so I am going with the flow. And the flow is quite good.  An updated version of www.hypefactor.com is up and running. Check it out.  S.O. and I had lunch with the legendary Paris Trout today. Paris is an ace Chicago soundman, road manager and basic jack of all trades. I first met him when he was an engineer on the aggression's FLOOD album, and he has since moved on to be an in-demand soundguy. Whenever he is in town, he makes a call and we hook up for a bite or a drink. I can't tell you how enjoyable his company he is. He's a great guy and I'm always happy to spend time with him. We urged him to get the Year of the Rabbit album, which is out tomorrow, and has been in constant rotation at MOGworld for a few days now. GET IT.  I'm happy to report that PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN does not suck. it's good clean fun. Gore Verbinski, who also directed THE RING, is quickly becoming one of America's best mainstream directors. Hell of a director.  The world of Chemlab is quiet today.   The MOGpac reunion at the German Beerfest this weekend was very enjoyable and it was good to see the entire crew make it out (big ups to The Kidd for making it for a bit despite his bowel problems). Though I came home smelling like a homeless man, it was good to get the Pac gather on one big park bench at the retirement home to drink pitches of beer .  Happy Bastile Day, and don't think we didn't have dinner at Les Halles tonight, cause we DID. mmmmmmm.  F         "
"             The Chemlab artwork continues to shape up into something very special. It's been a big thumbs up all around. You'll see soon!  In the meantime, more rough mixes arrive. This morning, via IM, Jamie and I review and discuss. We're on the same page, which is good. Because of the time difference, Jared will respond later. Almost there. Meanwhile, Jason's father in law, Russ, who is an excellent songwriter and a dynamic guitar player, came in to Cracknation to play over a Chemlab song called 'Force Quit'. He laid down a KILLER guitar solo that takes the song up to a new level. Russ comes from that Lennon/McCartney school of songwriting and guitar playing and he understands the ins and outs of a song. The stuff he plays swerves through this song like a bird. Well done and kudos to Jason for bringing Russ in.  A rough version of www.hypefactor.com is back up and running. I have some new designs for it that should hopefully go up soon as well. Brandt should be appearing on here soon to give more perspective to all things Hype.  I refuse to discuss my utter dislike for THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Anna Poontang is responsible, though I would have seen the movie eventually. I'm dying to see PIRATES. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.  Back to the mixes and then a mogpac reunion..at a retirement home. ;-)  F             "
"             Well the guest stars SHINED last night, even though Ash forced us to record in the dark.   Ash, of course, comes armed to the hilt with gear and Robin shows up being Robin, so you know it's going to be a fun evening. My only demand as 'boss' is that we lay down Robin's fingerpicking piece that I have been in love with. Other than that, it's free reign for anyone to do whatever they want. Ash JUMPS for the bass guitar. I'm not kidding when I say JUMP.  So you put all these rockers in a room and what do you get? Soundtrack music!! moody, atmospheric soundtrack music.  We wrote two songs, both of which sound like music for film, something I have been aching to do for sometime, but never really pursued. Ash's current obession is the bass guitar and his attention to it SHOWS, as he lends a unique rythmn to the material, which leaves me free to indulge in my Peter Hook fantasies, but at a new and subdued level. Robin is a master of the acoustic. Her fingerpicking piece, now titled 'They've Just...', is excellent. Brandt and I stared at each other a few times, knowing that we had something, new, special, different and excellent to add to HF2. When Ash is telling me to record strings, you know we're on a roll. I forgot how fun it was to sit in a room with a bunch of friends and just create music. And it helps that the music is amazing!  Hopefully, this will be JUST the first round with these two...  Chemlab artwork is rolling in and is MASSIVE. Like an idiot I first hated the cover image, wrote Jared to say so, and then an hour later I was in love with it and feeling like an idiot. Anyway, it fits the album perfectly and the guy doing this, Mike, at Burnlab is solid. The contributor to this album and the fan in me both now want this album DONE so I can just hold it and play it for my friends. I'm dying to give a copy of the Chemlab to the kidd and yes, even Mark Mohtashemi.  F  PS: Big ups to the Great Grendali for his hard earned SMACKDOWN 2 Ladder Match victory of the The Legend yesterday. It will go down in history as one of the all time great matches!         "
"             Hypefactor day 3: Reviewed B's guitar work since the last session. SOLID. Because of new additions to songs, I had to go back and change or improve upon some of my previously recorded basslines. Started a new tune that now takes us into the Cerati territory I have been hoping to go into. There is a nice groove to this one and a great light synth line that meshes well with the live instruments. Makes you bop yer head as it goes along. Finally got my hands on a guitar instead of a bass for a change to write some leads. Had been dying to do that since THE MOTIVE. Great Wall was eaten. We have six songs in the hopper now. Tomorrow the guest stars arrive.  I just realized you might not know who Cerati is. Go NOW to www.cerati.com. The man is a genius and an inspiration. Check him out. NOW. You'll thank me.  Chemlab artwork decisions to be made this weekend. I'm excited to see the options. The artwork is being done by a guy named Michael who has an excellent website www.burnlab.com (no relation to Chemlab). In the meantime, the conversations now turn to tracklistings and where to place the sutures. The Deadline might get pushed a week to make sure everything is perfect. I think thats a VERY wise idea.  S.O. has just made me tea. Sweet girl!  F           "
"             Jamie Duffy calls tonight to discuss Chemlab. In the almost decade I have known him, I don't recall him this excited about a project. He and I are rivet geeks to the end. We share that bond. I know. Needless to say the new mixes are coming from his twisted brain and deft hands, so my cup of tea is hoisted in his honour for a job well-done...(so far. the record ain't done yet).  Today, i see the first print ad for Chemlab in Outburn. This shit is REAL now. Also in this issue is an ad for the aggression and Hypefactor. I'm sure it will take the label the same amount of time to figure out that Hypefactor is one word as they did realizing the Kidd is my younger brother. rrr  Ash calls tonight to discuss Hypefactor. Ash, along with the in-demand Ms. Emmet, will bring much to the table this week. He updates me on Ass Cobra. I update him on HF and Chemlab. We express our mutual excitement for the Cerati gig on the 30th. I predict some great music to come out of the aggression's 'Power Station/Arcadia' phase.   Matt Gentile posts the first non-F.J. blog entry. THANKS. Matt is correct, I did in fact throw a temper tantrum regarding a new STAR WARS video game, which is NOT for PS2, but for the dreaded X-BOX (christened by me that very night as a 'F**K BOX). Matt and his lovely underage girlfriend invite me to drink beer with them and old German people this weekend.  Brandt IM's to say 'I'm laying guitars down for you bitch'. Now THAT is progress.  Matrix's remix of the aggression song 'THE LION's DEN' gets airplay on CYBERAGE RADIO (http://www.cyberage.cx). Very exciting.  S.O. goes out for the evening with the ladies. I stare at the Episode 3 WebCam. I watched them do makeup tests for Kit Fisto. You have no clue who that is, right? Oh I do! I love having a 5 year old cousin who, like me, has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things STAR WARS.  Back to the studio for tomorrow for HF Day 3.  F         "
"             This recent trend of exclusivity among game producers is REALLY beginning to irk me.  I own a GameCube and an XBOX - why?  because certain games come out on certain platforms.  Owning the GC is key, however, because more obscure titles have been released (like Eternal Darkness) that are brilliantly fun and very challenging - it's not the juvenile machine most non-believers think it is (besides, how juvenile is the next Rogue Squadron).  My good friend and fellow gamer FJ (PS2 owner, btw) and I enjoyed an evening last night filled with professional wrestling and a couple of S.O.'s and one G.  Aside from a good match or promo or two, the highlight was watching the game ads and wondering which platform it was going to be on.  the first was the aforementioned 'SW - Rogue Squadron' - exclusive to GC;  the next was 'WM XIX' - exclusive to GC.  The third was more exciting: 'SW - The Knights of the Old Republic'.  The suspence was near painful...XBOX.  FJ then let out a few unmentionables as he relayed his disgust with the platform exclusivity that is over taking the gaming world.  We then got a few kicks because the red neck trucker game is available for all platforms - FJ was happy to see he got something.  I send this plea out to the game companies and developers of the world...have a heart.  don't make us spend more money than we can already afford to go out and buy the latest gear just to play ONE or TWO games.  Make it a level playing field for the consumer.  Don't be dicks.  M.         "
"             In between the new Hypefactor sessions (and until the new aggression remixes come in), my musical attention turns to Chemlab. Granted, my role at this point is cheerleader (and sounding board for Jared), but the focus is still on the music and giving my input towards making this the best possible Chemlab is a major priority. Being asked to work on this album has been like getting called up to the Majors after being in the Minor Leagues for a decade. Like Bull Durham (maybe). So I feel some pressure and I know, as my S.O. will attest, that this pressure is totally self-inflicted.   The newest round of Chem-mixes came my way today and the progress is shockingly good. I’m so impressed by what is coming out of Chicago. The Cracknation crew, as producers, have really stepped up to what could be their best produced album to date (The last ILC record being my favorite thus far). As a musician who has written and performed on the record, I am happy with the results. Also, I am satisfied that these songs and sutures appeal to the massive Chemlab fan I have been for most of my adult life.  Chemlab has a unique fanbase, and my concern is that regardless of how good the album is (and it’s REALLLLLLY good), the “kids” (as we call them) will still find fault with it because certain people are not involved or it doesn’t sound like 1994, etc. I’m shocked sometimes how hardcore fans of bands cannot accept musical evolution. I like evolution. I’m one of those people who likes Depeche Mode’s SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION more than MUSIC FOR THE MASSES and U2’s ACHTUNG BABY more than THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE (Robin will kill me for saying that). Growth is fun when it works like it did with those two Flood-Produced albums. Love and Rockets went dance, and went crap. The open-minded will love the new Chemlab. The fools stuck in 1994 can never ever be pleased.  F         "
"             The first round of Hypefactor guest stars have been contacted and have agreed to pop into the studio this week to bring their unique stylings to the table. Knowing these first two guest stars quite very well and knowing what they are capable of, I'm psyched and honoured to have them come in. I stopped into the studio today to handle some Chemlab stuff (nothing major, just a few things Jared asked me to put together), and of course I had to pause to listen to this weekends musical results. I'm jazzed. Completely by fate and fate alone, my cameo at the studio today coincided with a delivery from Great Wall. An almost tearful reunion.  Going back and forth with the Chemcrew about the mixing and now the bullshit associated with releasing the album (i.e. artwork, credits, publishing, yadda yadda) begins. I heard the instrumental demo of a song called ATOMIC AUTOMATIC and I'm particularly pleased with how it's sounding. VERY Chemlab, very heavy, very nasty. mmmm. Jason sent me an update from the CrackStudio to tell me Mr. Duffy's dirty little paws have gotten a hold of some of these songs. I don't think anything pleases me more than a motivated Jamie Duffy. As this record develops, my confidence in the production team grows. Chemlab is in good hands.  And to top off the evening, I just found out that 88.7 WRSU FM, New Brunswick, NJ radio is spinning the track INFRINGEMENT from the Hypefactor EP. Nice!  Should be a busy week. Lots of studio time planned. Maybe someone from the MOGpac will write as well ;-)  F         "
"             Day 2 of the new Hypefactor sessions were again productive and successful. The rocker I mentioned yesterday has developed nicely. It now has a hard chorus and some sweet wah wah guitars. Upon reviewing the material so far, which is now up to 5 songs worth, I'm noticing a Joy Division undertone to it. Not in an obvious way, like say, with Interpol, but more  in modern context. At the end of the day, we pinpointed what additions are going to be needed for these songs, and that is mostly some guitar work. Once that is done, hopefully before my next LA jaunt this month, I will then take the songs and begin arranging. While thinking ahead, I realize that we need to quicken the pace with the second batch of songs. I want it to move a bit faster in places. But this is all embryonic, but the melodies are strong and so far it's a real big step forward. It was fun just sitting there reading NME while saying 'yes' or 'no' to potential drum loops. Rough, innit?  I am sickened by the news reports of terrorism at a rock festival in Moscow. I think it's no secret that MOGpac is very pro-Russia and the thought of such violence in that part of the world, especially after having just played there, effects all of us. The fact that this was an act of violence against kids at a rock concert makes this even worse.  The day ended with G and I checking out TERMINATOR 3. I was shocked at how intentionally goofy it was. Arnold is given tons of one-liners, and most are quite funny, but it takes you right out of the drama. Its hard to take seriously. It's also Cameron By Numbers. It's entertaining, but it doesn't really add anything new to that universe. The Birdinator (as I call her), is just a normal hot blonde. Nothing special, so you never accept her as a threat. I see birds like this in LA all the time. When they introduced Robert Patrick in T2, he was unusual looking and you never saw these FX before. Now its just some actress and the same FX. They needed to find an otherworldly knockout who looks like no one else, sorta like Angelina Jolie when you first saw her. The one positive was that the guy who plays John Connor, who I believe is Nick Stahl, is a million times better than that crackhead Ed Furlong, who I doubt could have carried this movie the way Stahl does. The movie was fun for sure, but Cameron ain't losing any sleep.  Though I am. Back to the Lab tomorrow. I think.  F          "
"             Since yesterday was Day 1 for the new Hypefactor material, I've decided to keep an ongoing journal about this record so a year from now I can look back and see what this album eventually started as and how much it either changed or stayed on course. Plus I want to see how scattered my brain really is when it comes to doing what I love the most, which is making music.   Day 1 was very productive. Surprisingly actually. It was very casual and the ideas were flowing. The first Hypefactor record started from songs that either Brandt or myself had already written and we would play over what already existed. This time it was starting totally from scratch usually from a simple 4 measure drum or synth loop. Already the sound is different. We've got four tracks in embryonic form and they seem darker, a little depressing, though the last song we started working on was a rocker. I'm interested in seeing that one come together.   Having not written on my own (i.e. not in a band atmosphere or with a producer riding me) in quite some time, it was a pleasure to just sit and play bass. I had spent the last year or so either just doing remixes, writing for Chemlab, or writing with the aggression in the rehearsal space (where Ocionic and Wedding Song were born), so I wasn't sure if I could immediately get back into the swing of writing for myself. However, I was more than ready and never really stopped for a second (other than the customary Wendy's break. thats when you KNOW I'm in the zone). I think it was the same thing for Brandt, who is a lot quicker of an engineer these days. I was jumping from bass to keyboards like a kid who needs ritalin and he kept up withour losing a beat.  Today is day two. I'd like to think we can pump out maybe 2 more. Once we have about 6 ideas down,  I want to start bringing people in to add over this stuff. I hear things and I'll say 'this needs (insert name here)' Last time, we didn't do the guest star thing till later in the process. This time, I want people to be in the early stages to help shape the songs. At the same time, I would like to have different people come in trigger a few new ideas. For example, Robin has guitar piece I want to lay down and Ash has an ambient piece I fell in love in when I accidentally downloaded it off his hotline account. I hope to bring in some non Mogpackers as well some OLD schoolers. We shall see.  The other benefit to this is that the studio is down in my old seaport neighborhood, so I am looking forward to my reuniting with the greatest Chinese take out of all time, Great Wall. A wonderful thing indeed.  More after day 2!  F         "
"             It's a national holiday. Everyone is travelling or bbq'ing or taking it easy. Of course, I will have none of that as I am literally packing up the bass to get started on the new round of Hypefactor songs. Should be fun and interesting.  Chemlab update: First from Chicago: Vocals are done and the album is officially in the mixing stage now. I think Mr. Duffy has gotten his hands on a few of the tunes so you KNOW good things are happening. From NY: I spent a few hours at Brandt's studio yesterday going through a cassette tape that Jared gave to me containing two full sides of old Chemlab demos from their East Side Sessions. There is so much incredible stuff on this mother. I immediately wrote Jared a threatening letter that we eventually had to go back to some of the songs that never saw the light cause there is a ton of good ideas on this that were never completed. Man, gimme some of the drugs they were on back then making this awesome music!  As usual, I have gone out and bought far too many discs lately. Everything from new Ogre (really good), Hate Dept (snooze), Type O Negative (a good return to form). But nothing and i mean NOTHING beats the long awaited live album from Primal Scream, called 'Live in Japan'. This Japanese only release is without a doubt one of the best live albums I have ever heard and I can't stop listening to it. if you are even remotely a fan, this is worth seeking out. As a hardcore fan of this band, I am blown away. I saw them earlier this year and loved it, but this disc surpasses that by a million times. It's one of those rare albums that makes you wanna go and be in a band. Incredible.  In other incredible news, the GENIUS that is Gustavo Cerati is doing a rare tour of the United States this month. To say there are happy faces in the MOGcamp would be an understatement. I'm seeing him in LA as well. DONT MISS HIM. What a trip to LA this is gonna be: the reunited Duran Duran, The San Diego Comic Con, Raw at Staples center (thanks AL), and Cerati, plus Brad Cramps bachelor party. oh yeah, I will work too ;-)  Have a good, safe holiday, kids.  F         "
"             Spent the bulk of the working on two things:  1. The new HF track SOLAR (now jokingly called SOLARIS in my computer). Took a long time to get into this track because I wasn't familiar with a lot of the tracks (mostly Summer Douche's 200 guitar tracks) and I needed to sit and listen to Ash's loops which are REALLY cool. I would say I spent a good 8 hours on this one. My initial version was over 8 minutes long, but as of this moment it's just under 6. I'm going to sleep on it and then decide if any more changes are needed. Then we'll commit it to mp3 and pass it out to the Factor Corp for further development. This song cries for the vocals of Peter Face.  2. Chemlab art and other business things pertaining to OXIDIZER, it's follow up, and a new F.J./Jared collaboration that I hope becomes the project I do after HF2. I have been quiet about Chemlab as of late, mostly because it's now just a matter of waiting for the record to come out. There is a lot of activity behind the scenes. I'll learn more perhaps when I'm in Chicago this weekend for Bradley J. Fox's wedding (S.O. and I are stopping at Crack Central to see the 'family' on Friday night)  I am obsessed with the MTV show NEWLYWEDS. That Jessica Simpson is a nightmare.  I just turned 31 years old as I wrote this. Blog Blog Blog.  F         "
"             We ventured to Brooklyn last night to check out the Sigur Ros/Bjork show. First off, I am a dead sucker for anything in Coney Island as I spent a lot of good times there as a kid. Of course we had to get us some Nathan's Hot Dogs. I hadn't been to the Coney since I beat the poo out of John Darryl Sparks on the beach during the recording of ALTAMONT, so that's quite a ways back. For the record, I'm not a violent man, but Sparky provoked said beating and Former Aggression Vocalist Turned Important Screenwriter cheered me on approvingly (and HE later smacked around John Darryl Sparks for worse than I ever did. Again, provoked)  So we got to the baseball field just in time to watch Sugar Rolls. I don't think it's any secret that I am not the biggest fan of this band, but I am loyal to Iceland so I decided to give it my full attention. Over the years, there have been several cases in which a band I didn't like on record totally won me over live. Fortunately, I am happy to say that this was the case with Super Ross. I totally understood after the first song why people liked them. First off, their musicianship is stunning. The arrangements are bizarre and the approach to performance is unique. Anything goes with these guys, and they have an amazing string quartet to that adds tons of emotions to the songs. And that's just what this band is, pure emotion. The singer is a beast who is able to bring these songs over the top. The songs build and build, oftentimes to a beautiful climax. Anyway, really good stuff. I was very very impressed and happy to be proven wrong.  For some reason, I have never been able to connect with Bjork. I have always appreciated her and her work, but I never went out of my way to get her albums, nor have I ever seen her live (I think I saw the Sugarcubes once), so I welcomed this opportunity to see her in action. Again, like her opening act Salmon Roe, I was really impressed, especially with the set up that included a string section, a harpist and guys with laptops (I think, it was hard to see from where we were). I cannot believe that voice comes out of that midget. Again, the emotion of the songs was intense and the occasional pyro and firework helped punctuate some of the big moments (wonder what Ash thought of those!). The bulk of the set consiseted of very dramatic songs focusing on the strings with broken beats (am i right, Ash?) Towards then end, they broke out the dance beats and really got the crowd really hopping. I would like to have seen a more diverse set, combining the dance and the dramatic songs throughout, but honestly, it's a minor complaint. Time flew quick and now I can understand why Bjork is such a phenom (as we say in wresting). My only other complaint are the hipster morons who were at this gig. I would not be surprised if Ash killed someone, cause I was that close. Hipsters need to GO, despite my girlfriends enjoyment of making fun of them (I can't blame her).  This show honestly should have been like in Carnegie Hall or something, not a baseball field in Brooklyn.  But Icelanders and Hot Dogs are a solid mix!  F         "
"             One thing I forgot to mention in today's post: For some time now, F.J. has been clamoring for a song on the record that embraces the vibe of Gustavo Cerati's ' urlLink Artefacto .' I've had a riff kicking around for some time, and while working on it today I think I found what he is looking for. More on this in the next two weeks...         "
"             As of 5 p.m. today - Saturday - there are enough guitars on 'Solar' to injure a small animal. So much for minimal.  Honestly, though, I could not help myself. The track captured my imagination right off that bat in a way that few do. It has a slow, funky shuffle - ' urlLink When The Levee Breaks ' meets ' urlLink A Northern Soul '-era Verve - that lends itself to all kinds of psychadelic jamming. I layered echo-drenched 12-string parts, harmonized e-bows, wah-wah'ed funk lines. Had I the time or money for  urlLink draw , this would be the track to which I would smoke.  I even added an extended track of  urlLink theremin , which previously made an appearance on the ' urlLink Theme From J-Bar .'  Now poor F.J.'s job is to sort out the twentysomething tracks of instrumentation. My realistic expectation is that half of what I recorded will be wildly altered or removed altogether, but that is OK. While I enjoy jamming and layering parts on these songs, ultimately everyone on this record subscribes to a 'song first' mentality. In other words, if the part does not work for the song, it goes. Plain and simple.  This working method also happens to be F.J.'s strong point as an arranger. I have never known him to discard a part that helped a song, and at this point in our long working relationship, I have the utmost trust in his discriminating ear. If something gets cut, it happens for a reason.  The process of arranging and cutting is also eased by the fact that there is little to no ego about individual parts among the members of this project. In all my time working on hypefactor, I have never known someone to piss and moan about  their  part being cut from a song. Well, there was that one time that all of F.J.'s bass parts were removed, and he went on a bender that ended with him capsizing his sailboat during the  urlLink Fastnet  race. But that's another story altogether...  Speaking of guitar parts, on Thursday night Ash played some sweet parts on a  urlLink Gibson ES-330  in between bouts of programming. His playing really stands out, and he clearly has an instinctive ear for a good hook. Like me and  urlLink Johnny Marr , Ash takes many of his cues from  urlLink The Cure's Robert Smith , a fine guitarist who has never quite received his due as a player from  urlLink the rock elite . Perhaps it was the  urlLink hair ?         "
"             I had chosen not to post about last nights session as I felt Brandt captured it almost perfectly. Almost. What he states below about my 'directive' to keep the new song 'minimal' is in fact, 150% incorrect. If you read below, my intent with the song, and I remain quite clear on this point, is that the GUITAR playing in the song should be minimal, not the song itself. I feel the key to this song is to keep the amount of guitar tracks down to a minimum. if anything, if I had wanted to keep the song 'minimal', the last person I would allow near the song is Ash. Anyway, I would like to reiterate that Ash was a freaking CHAMP last night and my 'let it flow' approach to producing this track brought out the best in these two chumps. If I thought something sucked or I had a better idea, you KNOW they would have heard from me. (Of course you know, fucking Brandt has 200 guitar tracks now thinking in his underage brain that the 'minimal' thing is out the door. Just wait till I arrage this sucker.)  And yes, watching Ash watch the monster Brock Lesnar beat the living hell out of the one-legged Zack Gowen was priceless.   In other news, I finally defeated the PS2 INDIANA JONES AND THE EMPEROR'S TOMB. Overall, I loved the game, though I didn't love all the supernatural shit at the end. However, that is applicable to the franchise and the makers of the game are to be commended for another great game that was totally worth the price of admission (thanks to the former high school classmate turned college roommate turned comic book expert buddy). Former high school classmate turned college roommate turned comic book expert buddy has shown me a preview of the upcoming BATMAN game, but before that, I think STARSKY AND HUTCH is going to be the  next big addiction, or most certainly the new SMACKDOWN game.  The big letdown of the week comes from my hero Jackie Chan who, with THE MEDALLION has single handedly killed the 'Jackie Chan Genre' by going against everything that made it great. The film is horrible and sends the asian action film back 20 years thanks to the utter disregard for EVERYTHING that makes Jackie Chan films great. Shame on you Jackie, Sammo and director Gordon Chan.  F         "
"             F.J., Ash and I had an extremely productive evening in the studio yesterday, and all four or five hours of the session were dedicated to the recently-unearthed 'Solar.'  If you read or recall my belated post yesterday, I was quite apprehensive about this session because of F.J.'s directive to keep the song very minimal. While I am a fan of minimal recordings, I am not a fan of recording minimally. I like  records that use many layers to sound mammoth — the whole greater than the sum method of production — and also those recordings that are multi-layered but are mixed in a way that emphasizes sparseness and empty space. I knew my natural inclination to take up 13 or 14 tracks with guitars alone was going to create problems on this song.  Well 'minimalism' promptly went out the window yesterday, and we have Ash to thank for it. While F.J. watched  urlLink a one-legged wrestler  get the crap kicked out of him on national television, I cued up the track for Ash and he pulled up his  urlLink loop library . It should be noted that the man is a connoisseur of electronic sounds as well as a fastidious producer. His taste in programming - rhythm programming in particular - calls for an obscene amount of creativity on the artist's part, and his own work always exceeds these high standards.  As he plowed through loop after loop, we knew we had something good going on. The track's density grew exponentially in the next two hours, with Ash adding everything from funky rhythms to a brilliant synth line that is similar in tone to NewOrder's introduction to ' urlLink Crystal .' Midway through his computer-based jam session, I picked up a guitar and started jamming along to his wall of rhythms. It was like having a live drummer in the room. I quickly worked out five or six parts for the verse and chorus, and F.J., like a wise producer, sat back and let it happen. The tune really came together for me last night, and Ash's rhythmic instincts and F.J.'s hands-off production technique were the elements that allowed it to happen. All around, a brilliant evening.  I was quite elated today to find  urlLink 'The Distracted Lover' listed on Amazon.com . While this is far from earth-shattering, I am extremely gratified that the CD is available so easily. Both F.J. and I have some rather esoteric musical interests, and we are all too familiar with the arduous process of tracking down records by bands with little to no distribution and promotion. Now if some kid listening to college radio in Trenton hears 'The Sweetest Soul,' he won't need to jump through hoops to track us down. Nice work,  urlLink Tinman .  Less than one week until  urlLink Duran at Webster Hall . in the meantime, F.J. and I were browsing eBay for  urlLink Power Station tour jackets ...         "
"             Brandt is a young douche who is paying $300 to see Duran Duran. That I respect. While he is quick with the wallet, he is slow with the posting  F         "
"             As you will probably note, F.J. beat me on my last post by about 10 minutes. Hence, I now look foolish for bragging about the fact that he hadn't posted yet. Again, shit.  And yes, wouldn't you pay $300 to see  urlLink this ?         "
"             For weeks, if not the entirety of the hypefactor sessions thus far, F.J. repeatedly insisted that he recorded a moody piano part for a song dubbed 'Exist,' one of four or so that are quite well-developed at this point. The issue came up every time we listened to monitor mixes in the studio, and F. never hesitated to make a snide comment about my having deleted this brilliant part from the song, thereby ruining the entire album.  And for as many weeks, I insisted this was a load of bollocks. 'Exist' emerged from a demo of a song I attempted with another band about seven years ago that I modified drastically in August 2000. I have a lot of pride invested in the track, and I knew there was no way I would have lost a part for this song were it as amazing as F.J. recalled.  Well, I was wrong. But only about 40 percent wrong.  While sorting through files on the computer before my trip to Chicago last week, I came across a Cubase file called 'Stay' that I thought was nothing more than a drum loop I programmed last summer. Again, I was only partially wrong. It was indeed a galloping drum loop I wrote the summer before, inspired by the vintage techno of the  urlLink NewOrder-Chemical Brothers collaboration  'Here To Stay.' But I had forgotten about the fact that, during our first or second session of the summer, F.J. and I slowed it down to about 90 b.p.m. He added bass... and piano.  Shit.  To say F.J. was pleased would be a slight understatement. He is right - the riff was pretty good, and we built on it last night by adding some synth parts and guitars. I was told that Pink Floyd was my inspiration, and we also worked out a chorus riff that hugged the minor key piano and bass parts nicely.  I know already that the track will be a struggle to complete. My natural instinct as a guitarist and producer is to take a  urlLink Phil Spector  'Wall Of Sound' approach to recording, and I will have to resist the impulse to layer guitar upon guitar and effect upon effect with this track.    I am sure that F.J. would rather he told this story first, but I beat him to the punch. But the way I see it, he has me to thank for the fact that we found the song in the first place. Of course, I am also the one who ' lost ' the track all those weeks ago. But normally he would have been up at 8 or 9 a.m. writing this. Too much ' urlLink Grand Theft Auto: Vice City ' the night before, perhaps?  Pick up the slack, F!          "
"             Dropped into the studio last night. Had no agenda really, I thought originally we were going to have Robin and Ash in there, but both bailed.  Speaking of Ash, he handed in a rough draft of THEME FROM PROPAGANDA and I am quite happy with the results. I think it’s off to a really solid start and has achieved what I was hoping to have on this album, a good house track to serve as the centerpiece. Besides some minor mix notes as well as a few structure ideas, this track is well on its way. It was a perfect first track to listen to in my new Ipod (THANKS IRENE!)  Anyhow, got to the studio and Brandt unearthed a track we started last month in the initial sessions and then somehow was forgotten. It consisted of a drum loop, enough basslines for a verse and a chorus and my long lost piano that I thought I had done in the song EXIST. I had been ranting and raving for the first month of this album that I had done piano somewhere and it was lost. Needless to say, it was nice to be justified that I am not crazy and we now have our eighth song for HF2.  We re-recorded some of the bass that I wasn’t 100% on and then I threw down some sci-fi strings that Ash will hate. Brandt played some sweet guitars, and I tried to steer him toward a “less is more” approach to this song. the results were akin to David Gilmour meeting Richard Ashcroft. Atmosphere is the name of the game for this tune, which now has the working title of SOLAR.  We’re back in the studio tonight, hopefully joined by ash and possibly Young Oscar Hess aka The Kidd. He’ll be the first person outside of the core four to hear the work in progress. As evidenced by his work on FLOOD and THE DISTRACTED LOVER, the Kidd is the person you want to have come in and give you a fresh perspective  on the material. Besides being my alleged younger sibiling, he is the only man I know besides me who has seen Marisa Tomei’s boobs in person. It’s a unique bond to share. I hope he makes it.  Had a long catch up session with original MOG member and former aggressioner Chris Link, who is impressed I have several of his F-11 songs in my Ipod. Link is a talented musician who I learned tons from in my formative years. Also, he got me into stuff like John Cale, Lou Reed and other cool stuff when we were young at NYU and I am forever in his debt (though I got him into Nick Cave!). I have invited Link to get in on HF2 while we are still writing. I’ll see him in Chicago next week and we will discuss further.  Further to an entry below, after tons of Duran Duran fans crashed the ticketmaster server during the internet pre-sale, I got crazy lucky and was able to purchase tickets to see the Durans at Webster Hall on my birthday next week. Normally I would brag about this and poke fun at my comrades who didn’t get tickets, but I got VERY VERY lucky and without Matt Gentile telling me the tickets were back up, I’d be watching THE MEDALLION on my 31st birthday. VERY VERY VERY lucky. Fate maybe.  F          "
"             Post blackout, Danny Boy, S.O. and I braved the hipster nightmare that is Piano’s to check out the glam man known as Saphin. First a little back story: A few years ago, while killing time at Luna Lounge, Danny Boy, Tom (excuse me, THOMAS), and I stumbled across a band playing what sounded like the soundtrack to VELVET GOLDMINE (The best soundtrack for the worst movie). Intrigued, we watched their entire set. The singer, who is Saphin (nee Jeff Saphin or JEFF) had the best elements of Ziggy-Era Bowie (including costume changes and a dressing room “tent”) and the band itself was INCREDIBLE. They had a guitar player who out-Bauhuas-ed Daniel Ash, a drummer who looked like he belonged in 25 Ta Life and a bassist who could best be described as an Israeli New Romantic. And this worked!!! And of course, they looked fantastic, so totally different, yet it all fit. This was one of those special bands in which you knew that if one element was different, it would flat-out suck. Together, these guys rivaled any major label band out there. Glam is a delicate beast to do properly and these guys tamed it and in my humble opinion, modernized it. Danny Boy was even E-mailing Saphin to make sure they would play their now classic I’M NOT GAY. Let me tell you, you have to be an amazing band to get someone like Ash to listen to songs like SEX IN THE NAME OF GOD and DAYGLO HALO. Nuff Said. They, like Saintface, became the band to see, and we were all huge fans.   And then, at one gig, JEFF announced “he” was going away to record an album and would be taking some time off. We were sad, but we couldn’t fault him (hopefully them) for wanting to make a record, at least now we could have the songs on CD! Plus, you could always surf their site, where you can learn all about JEFF, but really none of the other guys, which was annoying. Brandt ran into the guitarist, Evan Evangilista, one day in a train station and he ran away when approached. Then Evan started showing up in a band called Essex. Not a good sign…  Well, who knows what happened in between, because they did the record, and it was mediocre (and a total rip off, ask Matt Gentile, who, like me paid something like 30 bucks for a cd-r of this album). I don’t know if JEFF fired the rhythm section of they walked or what have you, its not my place to speculate as I don’t know the circumstances, but the record reflected none of that wonderful band we followed around for a year or so. Like Saintface, the frontman is the main driving force, but unlike Saintface, the band was made the frontman a star. No offense to my friends in Saintface, but the Saphin band had a unique chemistry straight off the bat that was tight and fierce. The songs were GOOD, but GREAT when that band played them. Saintface luckily has great songs (and not enough on CD, PETER!).  Then JEFF started playing again, but acoustically, which I didn’t go see as I am loyal to that band, then new band members started appearing on the website, and I wrote them off immediately. Then the decision was made to check out the all-new live band JEFF had assembled on Saturday night…It started off promisingly enough, as Saphin, in orange jumpsuit, went into the crowd offering people chips. And then the band played…  Well, S.O. didn’t make it through the first few songs, and quite Frankly, I couldn’t blame her. JEFF has a really good keyboard player (who actually adds to the material), a really decent guitarist, and a solid drummer, but that’s the problem. They’re all individually solid, but they are NOT Saphin. And to add insult to injury, Evan Evangelista was playing BASS. What the hell is that? It’s like Mick Ronson playing bass for Bowie. You don’t want the great guitar player who defined these songs playing BASS!!! UGH. The new guitar player lacks the style and substance of Evan. He is a power chord guy, and he can rock out, but the point is, Saphin is not power chord rock. I want Evan, not some guy who looks like Matthew Lillard. The problem is, these guys are good, REALLY good, but they have to compare to the previous incarnation, which was magic. Maybe they will develop in time…though probably into something different, and not something I would find interesting.  And what can I say about JEFF. He was once a glammed up androgynous alien half-breed that exuded irony like none other. Now he just seems pissed and looks like he wants to be in Interpol. The sexy innuendo is replaced by angst and it doesn’t suit those songs at all. He did show some signs of life during I'M NOT GAY, but it was too brief. Honestly, he appears to be an egomaniac, and I hope he didn’t piss off the other band members or did something stupid like fire them cause then I would be REALLY pissed at JEFF.   The costume changes are there but the fun is gone. Are Essex any good?  F          "
"             En route back to NY finally. Because this LA trip was so hastily put together, I flew out of Long Beach, which is a timewarp to the old tiny airports of the past. Think CATCH ME IF YOU CAN with high tech security and you get what I’m saying. Even had to walk out to the tarmac to get on the plane. LOVE that (see previous Iceland/UK 2001 photos). Flying Jet Blue for the first time. It’s quite humourous. They have Direct TV on the flight, with about 15 channels. Of course one of them has to be VH1 Classics and I am immediately drawn to the Power Station’s SOME LIKE IT HOT. Speaking of which…  I’m obviously doing something right as the Durans have decided to play a club show at Webster Hall, which is 7 blocks away from us. And when are they playing? August 27th, my birthday. Now all I need are tickets.  Agent/Lawyer/Advisor and I went to check out 16 Volt the other night in LA. Well, we tried to. Because she was late to dinner, thus making me and former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter wait forever to eat, we showed up at the venue at about 9:45. Eric Volt was kind of enough to guest list me, and his website and the ticketmaster site said “9pm” on it, so we expected to sit through some opening acts. At the door, the start times were listed and it read “16Volt 9:00-9:35” (or something like that). Um, WHAT? Who the hell actually performs on time on this planet and who makes tickets to a show available via ticketmaster for a band that is only going to play for 35 minutes? I can only assume this was a label showcase thing. So, sadly, no Volt. We then saw SWAT, which blows immensely. This was one of those days where you just couldn’t win. Two words: Los Angeles.  Some things l learned from the VH1 classics today. The 80’s BLOW and Madonna was a crap dancer. But Debbie Harry was AMAZING.  Ash has yet to deliver the mix of THEME FROM PROPAGANDA because of a pet related problem in his apartment. I am scared to ask for futher details, but the word “fleas” was used during a phone message. I spent a lot of time listening to the other current demos and remain quite happy.  I’m too tired and frazzled to think about anything other than being home, having a nice meal with the lovely S.O. and getting back into the PS2 Indiana Jones. I’ve missed some wrestling too. (it’s a shame that 20 minutes after I typed this, the power went out in the northeast, WHILE I was in the air…that’s a whole other story for another time)   F          "
"             Saw Year of the Rabbit again with S.O. the other night at Mercury Lounge. We stood right at the front and just smiled the whole time. Put simply: they're GREAT and play excellent rock and roll. It was fun seeing them after having heard the whole album. They opened their set with a cover of The Cure's 'PLAIN SONG'. That right there earns my respect. Afterwards, it was a quick stop at the Pub to catch up with Pater and then an Indian meal with my agent/lawyer/advisor/houseguest. Yes, I ate Indian food. S.O. is trying to make me more diverse. It's working...  Well the long awaited package arrived from Cracknation containing the next two Cracknation releases: Acumen Nation's 'LORD OF THE CYNICS' and a final yet unmastered version of the (extremely) long awaited and anticipated Chemlab album 'OXIDIZER', which as you may have read, I worked on a bit ;-)  Here are my brief thoughts:  'CYNICS' is the best written and produced Acumen record to date. The whole key to this album is Jason wisely making the most out of his new rythmn section, Dan and Eliot, and writing with them as a band. Their welcomed presence is very obvious in the material and the album is more akin to the live Acumen experience than any previous album. Also, Jason is finally singing more (something I had been nudging him to do for some time) and his grasp of melody is fantastic. the songs are catchier than the last album and the last song, CAPSULE, is a fantastic and soulful tune. Production is Cracknation standard, meaning its aces. I look forward to getting further into the album.  'OXIDIZER' is tougher to review because of my closeness to it. I co-wrote some of it, did a lot of sounds for it, and have been extremely passionate and vocal about this record for a long time. i can't review it. I am in love with 90% of the album and the other 10% I like but that mostly has to do with certain choices that were made for the album that I don't agree with, but thats real nitpicky stuff (i.e. 'oh i would turn the guitar up here' etc) and thats what happens in a band. 90% is a super figure. My curiosity about public reaction to the album is quite strong. I'm sure some fans will love it and others will not, and probably for the wrong reasons. They have to accept that this is 2003 and not 1995. This album is a full success and the hidden track on OXIDIZER will make the old schoolers happy!  Meanwhile...  Last night, S.O. and I saw the film SWIMMING POOL, which was quite good. I feel a certain member of the aggression, known for his love of the part of the female anatomy called the BOOBS, would like this movie, as it has a young woman running around without a top on quite a bit. Anyhow, I'm glad we saw this instead of SWAT.  Ash is in Boston visiting relatives, but informs Brandt that he will have an mp3 arrangement of 'THEME FROM PROPAGANDA' for us late tonight or tomorrow. Brandt intends to have some rough versions of the other songs for me on MP3 before I head back to LA tomorrow night. Hopefully this will happen and I will have a lot to study on the plane. What a great solo album? I'm home packing for LA and playing the new INDIANA JONES video game on mp3 while everyone else works on the songs. HAH! winner.  Seeing Saintface tonight...more later maybe.  F         "
"             I spent the bulk of Tuesday knocking another song into shape. I did some weird stuff with it, and basically what has come out of it is that we now have what we think is the album opener...  Last night, B, Ash and I gathered, mostly so Ash could hear the current arrangements and we could toss around idea for the next batch of tunes. Ash likes the arrangements, and everyone's comments are more 'the song needs...' and less 'I hate this' (In fact that never comes up). Concepts, thoughts, etc. are thrown back and forth. Ash is going to take the more acoustic oriented stuff and really mess around with them a bit. I created some atmospheric stuff for 'THEY'VE JUST...' and he will clean that up and build from there. I am confident in what he will come up with.  From the discussions recently, it has been my intention to do a song that was more dance oriented. I'm not saying techno, but something that was more loop based, more groovy, etc. Cerati has an uncanny ability to make great dance music that doesn't seem out of place on a rock album and this is really inspiring, especially since my roots in music are electronic. When in Russia, the MOGpac spent an evening in a house club called Propaganda, which was very inspirational for Ash and got me more interested in trying music of that type (and now infamous as being the place where Danny Boy Hamill lost his coat check ticket, thus keeping us in the club till they closed one night). Anyway, I think doing something like this has been in the back of my head as well as Ash's for some time now.  So the three of us formulate a plan that would involve Ash bringing lots of his gear into the studio and we would sort of 'jam' a song out electronically. However, this is put on hold when Ash plays a series of loops out of his laptop that B and I go mental for. Immediately we pick up guitar and bass and start to jam along. And what do you know, a few hours later we have tons of parts for a new song. Instead of using the studio computer that runs Cubase, we recorded straight from the mixer into Ash's laptop, where he is running the program LIVE, which he swears by and is excellent for this kind of music.   This song is now called 'THEME FROM PROPAGANDA' and will probably end up as the centerpiece of the album. It's the 7th song written thus far and we were lucky that the stars were aligned last night and we wrote a VERY cool song. Ash is going to arrange it as he would one of his club tracks and I have a vague idea for a vocal melody that might work in an Underworld/'THESE MILLION NIGHTS' kind of way.  We left the studio quite jazzed. Ash also has come up with a GREAT idea for a guest vocal spot. I'll be getting on that invite right away.  Tomorrow, I should be writing about the final Chemlab mixes and the new Acumen album should they actually arrive (JASON!)  F         "
"             Taking the streak even further, I cruised into the studio on Sunday to check on progress there. I played my new arrangements and received an enthusiastic thumbs up for the first four songs. B then played me some new guitar parts for a rocker called 'Clean Up' (this is NOT the final title, I'm just sick of typing 'the one where I play bass here and he plays guitar here', know what I mean?). I was dead into these guitars and demanded I'd be given the parts immediately to go arrange this tune. B complied and when trasnferring the songs from laptop to laptop, my powerbook takes ANOTHER DIVE!!!!!  Angry beyond belief, I dropped everything and ran to Apple. Got soaked in the rain as well. So I get to Apple and lo and behold all I did was hit one wrong button and everything was fine. But man was I pissed. But man was I happy to learn nothing was messed up and I was able to go spend a nice evening with S.O. and the nice people who raised me.  We have the agent/lawyer/advisor staying with us, but while she is off doing legal things and S.O. is working, I was able to arrange 'Clean Up' and E it over to the studio, where B sang its praises. He would tell me if it was crap, so I am quite pleased.  Note that Hypefactor.com is now running with news and the 'Making Of The Distracted Lover'. Worthy reads. Pictures soon I think. I gotta get this beard on film, you know.  Ash and I talk via IM yesterday. He was messaging me from an airport in Florida, where he was able to wirelessly connect. How I don't know, cause i don't think it was via his cel phone. I am kinda scared of how he did that, yet I am impressed and ponder all the time I could save at LAX and Newark with that ability. Ash is into the HF2 material and we plot some new ideas based on things I have discussed previously with him and B. MP3's are exchanged for inspiration and reference. I am still scared of his ability to connect to the net in the airport...  I will try to maybe get to one more song today, if I feel it, and we might gather The HF Corp. this week to review what we have at this point and maybe work on new stuff.  Chemlab is being mastered this week by Dave Suycott of Machines of Loving Grace and Stabbing Westward. He's got some good ears on him, so I am confident the final product will sound massive. The label has the artwork and hopefully this will be in production quite soon. I can't wait to hear the final mixes! I'm sure you can't either...it's worth the wait!  F          "
"             During my recent West Coast jaunt, I couldn't get focused on the HF2 material, mostly because the Chemlab mixes were rolling in and it was hard to switch gears. I've written music long enough to know not to force myself into doing anything or it's just gonna suck... I usually have to wait for the songs to call out to me...  Well, today I got that call and finally got my ass in gear. I started at 8am with the intention of doing the Audio Warfare remix, but the next time I looked, it was 3pm and I had arranged four HF2 songs. I'm REALLY happy with what I've put together. The bulk of the time was spent filtering through what's been played and picking out the best takes to use. Luckily, the talented people who have been playing on this record have given me a lot to choose from and work with.  I then went out for a stroll that ended up being several hours. I had to force myself to get something to eat, find out what's going on in the world, and listen to new CD purchases without distraction. Some of my time was spent with Peter Saintface, who I always have time for. We caught up on all things HF and SF. They are far along with the recording of their new EP, however, after their gig this coming weekend, Peter is off for 2 weeks in Paris. Poor guy ;-) Of course, the lightbulb went off in my head to steal some of his bandmates to come write with us while he is away. He likes that idea. When he returns, he's going to come into the studio to hear what we have.   I went back home and went at it a few more hours, mostly polishing what I had done today and starting the arragement for one more song. Unlike the old days, this would normally be declared as the final arrangements, but this stage is more for us to figure out what else is needed in each song and what we have to do to flesh everything out. It's a true work in progress. Also, I'm taking into account that live drums are going to go over these songs as well. Thank God I have an amazing drummer...  I might go into the studio to hear what Brandt has done with some of the guitars and to give him a feel for what progress I have made here at MOGworld. There's no deadline yet, so we can really take our time and do it right. This evening I finally explained to the label that Hypefactor is ONE word, not two. What a productive day!  Oh and I cooked too!  F         "
"             After seeing a really good film called DIRTY PRETTY THINGS, starring Audrey 'My eyes are bigger than your head' Tataou, the S.O. and popped into Kim's (her fave record store) for some late night CD shopping. Usually Kim's is a bit hipster for my taste, but last time we were there I found a flyer for the Cerati gig, so I thought maybe lightning would strike twice and I would discover something interesting. And sure enough i did, and I picked this up, which they had just gotten in:  'BE-MUSIC: COOL AS ICE: LTM are proud to present a compilation of stone classic old school 80's electro and dance cuts produced by Be Music, the tag used by all four members of New Order. The tracks were largely produced between 1983 and 1984 for release on Factory Records and Factory Benelux. Some tracks marked were co-produced by Be Music (Bernard Sumner) and DoJo (Donald Johnson, of A Certain Ratio). Nyam Nyam and the Be Music Theme were produced by Peter Hook, and Life and Thick Pigeon by Steve Morris and Gillian Gilbert. Several of the tracks, including Love Tempo, Looking From A Hilltop and Cool As Ice remain influential club classics, and have been extensively sampled and bootlegged. Several years before the great house explosion, with their own Hacienda club still empty every single night, yet way (too far?) ahead of their time, four guys and a girl from Manchester produced a whole bunch of pure sonic magic which made waves worldwide. The album has been digitally remastered and runs for 74 minutes. The set will be available both on CD and as a limited DJ friendly double vinyl set. The vinyl version will be limited to just 1000'  Well I'd be lying if I told I had ANY clue as to what the hell this was so I snagged it and am listening to it now. It sounds a bit dated, but is quite good and it all comes across as a testing ground for New Order's music around this time. There are tons of sounds and programming nuances that later appear in some of New Order's classic material from this period. It's all very electro, very 80's club friendly and very very influential. It's a fascinating document of a lost yet important period of a legendary band's career. Plus there is a cool tune at the end that Peter Hook did. Also, according to the liner notes, Johhny Marr makes an uncredited cameo on one the Sumner-produced songs, hence the early stages of Electronic!  However, this is for hardcore New Order fans or 80's club kids only. So keep that in mind...  Meanwhile, work continues on the HF website. The news section should be going up soon and we've written a very extensive 'Making of THE DISTRACTED LOVER', similar to my 'Making of FLOOD' over at the aggression site. I had to admit to slacking on the tunes a bit, but fear not, I'm getting back into the swing of things. Also, I have to start work on the Audio Warfare remix, and I'm happy to say, unlike most songs I remix, I quite like this tune and there is a lot of fun material in it to mess around with.  Jared is probably just back in London as I type. I don't know the results of the final day, but everything seemed to be going well. I think the artwork went into Caroline yesterday and the music has to be in on Monday. I'm going to try and call over to Cracknation this weekend for an update.  Ok, time for tea and remixing...  F         "
"             Little B has the flu, so the studio is basically contaminated. Thus our Tuesday studio event was out the door. Sissy boy. However, news comes Mattagement that both HF and the aggression have received reviews in the newest issue of Outburn. THE DISTRACTED LOVER, which received an 8 out of 10, was a well written review in which I felt the reviewer gave it a fair shake and actually knew what the hell he was talking about. Most shocking was that his favorite track on the CD, PIRATED, is in fact my least favorite. Meanwhile, the aggression's DEVIATIONS ep got a 6 out of 10 from some reviewer who seemed more hellbent on classifying everything in a genre as opposed to actually getting into details about the music. While the reviewer is very kind to FLOOD as an album, it's shocking at how the two reviews differ. One is well written and really gets into the guts of the CD while the other sounds like some bored kid trying to explain something to a pal in the dorm room. Anyway, its fun to hear opinions like this, especially when they're good. Of course, right when we get reviewed, the label doesn't have an ad in sight for any of these records. No one in the MOGcamp is shocked.  Via the wonderful world of the Internet, Ash has delivered his parts for the second half of the track we call TWO BASSES. As a joke, I call it TWO BASSES THIN. If you get that, you get 10 points. Anyway, I am due in DC this week so I want to take this track with me to really get into it. The first half is slow, this new half is faster. The key to this will be to make a solid transition between the two. I see this at the moment on the second half of the album. (I write that simply so a year from now we can compare where the track actually ends up)  I close the evening reading about Raymond Watt's new project, which is called, and I love this...WATTS. My dear friend Marc Heal appears on this I think. This will give the Kidd and I much enjoyment as we love all things Raymond. I hope it's good. I hope I don't have to order it from Japan. I hope it's awesome. Meanwhile, Bryan Black is going to put out the long-awaited Haloblack album THROB soon. I'm curious how that album will be received by the kids. Louche slipped it to me a while ago. I dig it, its really well done. However, it is not fast, not hard, but unique and interesting. I can hear the douche coldwave kids (not you, Aero) complaining. But kudos to Bryan for expanding his palette. It's a tough sell of a record though. The only thing Coldwave I'm digging thats new is Christ Analogue's new one. That's a hot album.  Watts will probably be awesome. Hopefully  F         "
"             Early AM call at the studio yesterday for us to review Robin's guitar parts from earlier in the week and alter NEW SONG to fit those parts accordingly. Quite happy with the track and it's new rockier vibe. Also went over my newer chorus basslines for EXIST, which I'm not as happy with, mostly because they conflict with the hook-bass I had previously written. The Hook-basslines are better and have to stay. Not sure what I'm going to do here yet, but one I idea I have tossed around is having Ash play bass over this part for a different feel. That might do the trick.  Then we settled down to handle basslines for 1956. Tough track and because its faster and rockier than most of what we have been doing, it took a long time for me to get the right feel for it. Also, this record is going to be as 'live' as possible, meaning, we're trying to get the human element of having someone play consistantly over a song as opposed to taking a measure and cutting and pasting repeatedly. To get into the feel of the track, we put on some Primal Scream tracks that i would play along to. Once we felt I had the Mani vibe cooking, I got to work. The song is in three diverse parts, one is the very hard , the other is a synthy dance section (the verse) and the last is is a melodic string part (the chorus). So I had to play three different basslines that encompassed three different moods. I think what we got down works and should set the tune in motion. It's hot, rocky, and dirty. As everything should be.  We've started scouring through books and such for art inspiration. I'm going to be doing the art on this one so we're are throwing some ideas around. I want to do a photo session with everyone to get that vibe. Maybe this can happen tomorrow night if we can get everyone together. I'm thinking Anton Corbjin, but I always think that. I just need some photos to get the ideas flowing.  Besides playing the new Hybrid album non-stop (and not just the tracks with Peter Hook on them) I am really into the new UNKLE album, which is quite good and features a Stone Roses reunion of sorts with Ian Brown and Mani on the same track. Also digging the Manics for some reason this week. Over the next month or so we should be checking out some great gigs including: Spiritualized, Death Cab For Cutie, Twilight Singers and of course, Saintface. We're going to see the MAN Izzard on the 11th. HAPPY DAYS.  As for Chemlab, I am at a loss and have no idea what is going on. Frustrating!  F         "
"             With Ash unable to make it last night, the spotlight focused on Ms. Emmet, who, while brought in initially to be the aggression’s first and only drummer (and quickly became my favorite member of the aggression), has become quite the impressive guitar player in Hypefactor. Because of changes made to the track she initiated, THEY’VE JUST, we re-recorded her guitar parts and tried different variations of it (i.e. acoustic and electric guitar takes), so we have lots to play with. As always, her focus and desire to see things come out perfect is a blessing. Once that was out of the way, we recorded her playing some Noel Gallagher style rock guitar on NEW SONG (obviously, just the working title), and by God did she turn this song into the rocker I was envisioning. Robin’s a really talented musician and my intention will be to make sure she is never underutilized. And yeah, she’s my favorite member of Hypefactor, too. Between Robin, Ash and B, I feel quite fortunate to have all these talented people working on my “solo” album.  We loaded 1956 in the computer, but because of our Robin-centric evening, we will get to this song during out next session, but everyone seems pretty hot for it.  Back in the other musical universe, our friends in Dubsinth back in St. Petersburg Russia have handed in their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS for the forthcoming aggression EP. Yura, aka Atom Fear, has really delivered a great, slow, moody, and cinematic remix that will fit very nicely on the final CD. Awesome work!  Sino, from Japan, informs me his remix of DREAMS TO DEATH is finished. Hopefully, I will be able to write about it shortly. Also, Cyanotic, an industrial band I know from the Midwest, wrote to tell me they should be delivering a remix on or before 10/1. Of course, my musical Alzheimer’s has kicked in and I can’t remember what track I gave them. Anyway…  Danny-Boy informs me I missed the NYPDBLUE season premiere. I must really love this album to forget such an important event. But there is no more important television event this year than the 24 season premiere on, I think, October 28th. I need TIVO. Immediately.  F          "
"             I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day. Once upon a time, it seemed as though Eric and co. we're going to be the break out stars of that scene we were all once a part of. The Kidd, Mark Mohtashemi and I were big fans of this band, especially during their Skin/LetDownCrush era, which I think many feel was their peak. Those two records are classics and really had a unique sound and feel to it. During this period, Eric did an awesome remix for us of CROSS, which is on our second CD. Later, they assembled what I felt was going to be the 'dream team' with Krayge Tyler, Mike Peoples, and Servo, and while it kicked ass live, I felt Supercoolnothing was a bit of a let down (no pun intended. While I loved the songs, I felt it was too metal for my taste, though i find myself going back to it every now and then.  I don't know the circumstances of thier break up, but I know they had recorded new material via a demo deal with Capitol or some major, which I can only assume fell through. Also, Jason was telling me how he had been talking to Eric about an Acumen/16v double bill. I guess that's off, but it could have made for a hell of a swan song. Now I double regret our showing up too late to see them in LA last month.  I think 16V had a few more good albums in them. Perhaps later down the line they can bring it back. In the meantime, I hope this doesn't stop Eric Powell from continuing to make music. He's an extremely talented dude.  In the meantime, about a year or so ago, the aggression began demo'ing songs for what might have been their next CD. the material was quite good, but debate ensued as to weather or not these were aggression songs and they are currently in 'limbo'. A song or two from the 'Fernwood Terrace' sessions will probably end up on the Ass Cobra album, but one of those songs, titled 1956 will now be appearing on the Hypefactor record. I'm REALLY excited about this track, which is very Primal Scream, and appreciate Ash signing off on it. We'll work on it tomorrow night.  F         "
"             Quick Pit Stop in the studio yesterday for some bass overdubs and retracking some older parts to fit the current scheme of things. Quite frankly, it was too nice out to sit in the studio too long. We did some stuff, fixed some tracks and went CD shopping at Rebel Rebel. Of course we spent too much money (Brandt in particular), but it was worth the hit as the purchases between both of us (new UNKLE, Hybrid featuring Peter Hook, and Muse's new one) were all winners and now blasting loud on the Ipod.  The vision for the rest of the album becomes clearer. A track written in the aggression camp might defect to HF2 if I can get Ash to sign off on it. If so, we're going into Primals territory. More when I know.  S.O. and I spent last night at college galpal turned publicist to the stars 30th birthday party last night. Though these things are normally not my scene and despite the former TV star turned Batman pulling a no show even though he RSVP'd (and much to the relief of S.O. and the birthday girl who are afraid of that combo), it was fun to see my estranged pal Amidala dancing in the same room with Jean Gray and Chuck Barris (who can dance like a mother). The title of this entry says it all and you can credit that quote to Danny Boy.  Though we did make it to San Genarro this afternoon, I am sad to miss beer fest today though I enjoy the company of my very small relatives (and should be home in time for some PPV).  F         "
"             Booted out of MOGworld for a girls night, I made my way to the cage last night to review our work with Link as well as address the outstanding needs for the album as it stands. It mostly became a night of fine tuning and bass overdubs. What I like about the brisk yet leisurely pace of this album is the ability to have some perspective and really focus in on things. Recently, Ash was pointing out something he felt was lacking in one of the songs and then added that he wanted to make sure everything was at the highest level it could be. Sometimes that requires throwing whole parts out (like we did with the verses to SOLAR) or sometimes it requires going deep into the song, listening to every individual part and either adding or removing something, which we did last night by creating a new chorus bassline for EXIST. Long, hard work, yes, but rewarding when you get the desired results.  A new song is brewing, I might have mentioned this somewhere. I think Brandt's working title for it is BITTER PARTY OF ONE or some gayness like that. Unlike the other songs on the album, he's written guitars, keyboards and such first and then I'm throwing basslines down. We did something similar on KIEKO'S LAST SMILE on HF1, but that was mostly because I hated the tune initially and was indulging him. Of course, it ended up being one of the best tracks I have ever been a part of. Anyway, the parts he has so far are quite good and he keeps throwing bits and pieces of this new tune at me each time I show up. I play bass and then I never think about it again. Then when I come back, I hear where he is at with it, and I dig it. Watch, this one's going to be a keeper.  With the exception of one track, which I need parts from Ash for, the next week or so is in Brandt's hands for guitar overdubs, so I get to breathe a bit (though I doubt I will). We spent hours last night figuring out where new guitars need to go or where current ones need to be changed. The rest of the evening was spent, almost in frustration for me, trying to figure out what the album is missing at this point. We have 8-9 songs, and I would like to see it end up being 11 songs plus the hidden track previously discussed. Therefore, there probably needs to be one last round of writing and I'm going to spend the next few weeks or so figuring out what else I would like to hear on the album as well as coming up with some interesting approaches to writing said material. My intention is to be ready to record drums by 10/1.   Well, have you see all this wonderful publicity for the Chemlab album? (read that as sarcasm).  I've got The Cure's TRILOGY DVD on. Forgot how good an album Pornography is, though I like Ash, Tom and Matt's version of 100 YEARS much better ;-)  F         "
"             From an E-mail from Peter Saintface yesterday when seeing if he wanted to hang out:  'Hey F, Afraid I have a SF recording session slated...looks like this EP is actually becoming an LP'  About time.  F         "
"             Former MOG founder and aggression superstar Mr. Link came to town, sax in hand, and though we had a short amount of time with him, it was very productive. Ash came in as well for this special occasion, and with Brandt, the 4 of us were able to hammer out a newly designed verse for SOLAR, which needed the revamp. Link plays some sexy sax in it. Its very deep now, more the album closer I was hoping it would end up being.  We then did an improv jam, totally over 10 minutes of the four of us playing to a click. Very light, very jazz. Look for this song, now called CHATTING BIRDS, as the hidden track. Last but not least, we recorded tons of Link just playing sax for future use. Lots of incredible material to go through.  We then had a fun pac/poontang meal and drinks. Great stuff.  ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO was entertaining, but see LOST IN TRANSLATION immediately. NOW. Go. The Links, Danny-Boy, SO and myself checked it out tonight and its wonder ful. I love Scarlett Johanssen. She's a heartbreaker. In the theatre was the guitarist from Interpol with the muttonchop sideburns and let me tell you, he LIVES the gimmick. All I'm saying.  Here's some product placement...  http://cn.rockdell.org/cracknation/attachments/IM000448.JPG  Thanks, Pally!  F           "
"             The Factor Corporation gathered it's division heads at the cage last night. The Head of Engineering decided to show an hour and a half late, which gave yours truly, the CEO, the opportunity to have a nice drink at Les Halles downtown with Deputy Douche. Later we were joined by General Rabinowitz and I gave them a sneak preview of the new Chemlab, which they liked and appreciated. A good test.  Anyway, once we all got up to speed on where all the songs are at, we went back to those earlier acoustic tracks the four of us recorded some time ago. They hadn't been addressed since the initial recording. Well, one of them, which we just call TWO BASSES (obviously wont be the final title) has now morphed into a really cool trip hop track that suddenly goes dance. VERY cool loops from Ash and then Robin and I recorded some additional guitars and bass, respetively. B wrote some new stuff as well that he will be recording in the coming days. Suddenly this track has a whole new life and a new vibe that I am very into.  We then addressed THEYVE JUST, which will remain a sparse, acoustic based track (I think). Robin went mental (for Robin) and was pissed a certain take of her guitars wasn't used. I think she hit Ash at one point, even though this is really something I did. Anyway, we found the part and will be putting it in. I promise, Robin! I think Brandt has a track or two to add to this one and then I will take another pass at it. Very moody piece, very romantic and fits real well on the album.  Lastly, we tackled SOLAR, which we all have problems with. Everyone has pin pointed that the problem lies in verses, which are not as full developed as the choruses. People were a little hesitant to make comments cause I had done the arrangement, but I was fully in agreement with the comments made and am determined to get this song up to speed. Brandt had some guitar lines that I think I totally missed that will work on improving the verses. This weekend, the idea will be for me to write an entirely new bass line and get some sax in there. I see this as the album closer. The song is there, we just need to develop more.  A lovely trip back to the Gramercy area with Robin, the ass grabber. She expressed to me how much she she enjoys working with HF, but also misses the aggression. As Batman used to say in the old TV series: 'Poor Deluded Child'.  All in all, it was a very productive evening!  On a side note, America loses two great icons in Johnny Cash and John Ritter. Rest well, men.  F         "
"             Today is 9/11.  I am happy to be alive and be the luckiest fucker alive.  To life. Drink up.  F  PS: Christian Bale is Batman. inspired choice.          "
"             While the asses cobraed yesterday, it was back to the Birdcage (the new name for the studio) to work on the Audio Warfare remix. As I'm sure you can figure out, the track is pretty hard, and quite honestly, the remix is even harder. I think my friend Christian Nitrate will approve.   Needleye delivered big time on their remix of the aggression's MY WHITE NOVA. It's a stormer and does what I like best with remixes, uses a lot of the original song for the listener to know its a remix, yet adds so much of themselves to it that it becomes interesting and original. They manipulated a vocal that original said 'you were so goddamn pretty' to sound like 'you were so goddamn prissy'. Hilarious. Kudos and thanks to Gilez and Needleguys. The remix reminded me of why I originally wanted to be in a heavy band.   However, now with half the EP now, I find myself in that position that I HATE more than anything, which is nagging the other remixers to hand theirs in by the deadline. This is even harder when you have people remixing in places like Japan and Russia. When I was watching over 12 or so remixers for PURE LIQUID EGO, I felt like the bigggest asshole in the world trying to get people to finish, especially since they were working for free. Hate it. I do like nagging Jamie Duffy though...he deserves it. ;-)  It's interesting that while I am chin deep in the Hypefactor album, I find myself going back to listening to very hard music. I'm loading the Ipod with old v23, Schwein and of course, old Chemlab. I think this is a yin and thing. Ash was recently disenchanted with one of his many musical projects and I explained to him that we all have different moods and the music we do reflects that. That's why now, in our Power Station/Arcadia phase, I feel a longing for the aggression and that kind of music. Eventually. Right now, I have Chemlab to keep me in that vibe.  The evening ended at the pub celebrating S.O.'s birthday with half of poontang and half the pac (in the form of G and the Kidd). The evening included cameo's from Bing and MURRAY! Good times, though we send good thoughts out to our dear friend Dorg, who had a bit of a spill earlier in the day and is in rough shape. Much love to her.  And now...brunch.  F           "
"             Regarding a collaboration between Duran Duran and Gwen Stefani, Guitarist Andy Taylor said: ''It also has to work musically. We're not just going to bring someone in because they're Gwen Stefani ...'  Le Bon quipped: 'Oh, I would!'  Genius.            "
"             Took a brief pit stop into the studio last night for a few hours to fix up Solar. Some parts previously laid down needed to be re-recorded to fit in the song properly. When arranging, this happens. So of course a simple piano part now is three tracks of three different ideas that I will sort through today. Once this minor tweaking is done, I'll E it over to the studio, where B will prep it as am MP3 for the 'Corporation' (as I call it) to hear. I have a good vibe about this song.  We had the Latin Grammy's on, hoping to get a glipmse of Cerati, who I have a feeling didn't bother to show, despite being nominated for Best Rock Album (I think).  Meanwhile, Brandt presented some parts for the new song he mentioned earlier here in the blog blog blog. Despite it's Thrill Kill Kult rip off strings that might need tweaking, I quite liked and laid down a quick bassline. I struggled for a bit to come up with more and decided not to push it and wait till B lays down all his guitars. His parts for this are good and I'm looking forward to playing with this one.   The new Twilight Singers EP arrived the other and day and all I can say is: Greg BY GOD Dulli, you have been sorely missed. Welcome back! Dan Hamill has taken a full week of work off just to listen to this three song EP. Can't miss this one and the cover is sweet too.           "
"             Blog blog blog. Dear Bloggie...  Just got back from the Bradley J. Fox nuptuals in Chicago. Good time and good to see former aggression members as well. I think we have Mr. Linq locked in for an appearance on HF2. He has the demos and was digging them quite a bit when we parted ways. He and Nina should be popping into MOGworld next week. Came home to find the 24 marathon in full effect. Needless to say, I am a big 24 mark and was suckered in immediately as was Mr. G 70 blocks away.  The new aggression remix EP takes shape. Needleye has finished their remix and it's on it's way. I don't even know which song I sent them! SINO from Japan has agreed to do a remix and Brand't is getting the parts ready as we speak. The Russians have finished one and have asked if they could do more! Can't complain about that.  Saw the family Novak while in Chicago for a fun evening. It was good to be there in a non work situation. Which of course meant Jason and I went straight into the studio to listen to the Crack works in progress. With the Novak kids asleep, the grown-ups fast-forwarded through the much discussed MTV awards. The Madonna/Britney thing was a snooze, but Jack Black is a genius. Anyway, I thought the Duran Lifetime achievement award was a great idea on paper, but was executed poorly. Still, to see them on TV was great...and speaking of the Durans...  On the 27th, my 31st Bday, some of the crew caught Duran at their intimate gig at Webster Hall and by god was it incredible. Please refer to my previous post from the gig I saw last month and apply it here, except 500x better, which quite possibly makes this my favorite gig of all time. it was a shorter set, but we left that gig drained and amazed. I was also glad to see that the last gig wasn't a fluke and these guys mean it. Just see any recent review in the NY papers and you'll see. Amazing.  Spinning the new BRMC CD at the moment, so far, they have avoided the sophomore jinx. So far.  Chemlab's drop date is supposedly the 3rd week of October. I designed a Chem Tshirt that hopefully some of you will be wearing soon. A new project with Jared (not Chemlab) is in the planning stages and should be the project I segue into after the recording of HF2, though bough projects might run simultaneously.    Brandt tells me I have some work to do on SOLAR. I like the sound of that!  F           "
"             Back again from another Saintface gig last night, this time an early show at Mercury Lounge. Solid as always, and some of these new songs, including the set closer, are great dance tunes. However the gig was too early and quite, ahem, Frankly, I think they are playing around town too much. They should be out there less while their album is in progress. It will build anticpation and they would have better turn outs at the gigs. PLaying too much gives people the opportunity to skip a gig because they can always see them 'next time'. The aggression would play gigs like events so if you missed it, you were screwed (that doesnt always work either, but hey). As for the Saintface album, I predict this album will be quite good and worth the wait. Peter again is cryptic when asked about certain songs being on the album. He should be when I'm around, I guess!   I met with with both Peter Saintface and Michael Saintface tonight to discuss the new Hypefactor album. I also took the opportunity to finally give them the HF2 demos. Brandt got a bunch of songs into better shape so I could give them to the guys. They seem excited and Peter in particular seemed really keen on getting into it. I hope they can be a big part of this.   As mentioned above, new HF demos are now circulating amongst the core crew. I had purposely stayed away from listening to the tunes for a few weeks so I would be fresh eared when hearing these new roughs. I'm happy to report I am still loving this bitch and want very badly to get back into this record tomorrow. We're ready for live drums!  Ill be posting less mostly because Former High School Classmate turned College Roommate turned Magazine Writer got me the new Smackdown game for the PS2...what can I say other than THANKS!   three words: Cerati. Remix. Album. I ran straight to Ebay and got this 2cd bitch from Argentina. I cannot wait.   And the day begins....            "
"             Been crazy working on Chemlab. Jared is off to Chicago today for the remaining details and then he is off on the Pigface tour. I've been sorting through the new mixes, dong notes and also doing some last minute sound design work for the EP. Fingers crossed no one at INV screws this up (no offense to everyone there, im just anti-labels today, keep reading). The mixes are dirty and more Chemlab than Chemlab. It's harsh and I like it. Luckily, the songwriting is really solid and the music itself is excellent, so its just a matter of mixing and getting it just right.  Mr. G and I caught Paul Weller the other night at Town Hall. It was an acoustic set and he was joined by Gem Archer of Oasis. I don't own any Paul Weller albums (mostly because G owned tons of it when we were roommates), but man do I want to now that I have seen him. The man is energetic and the songs were excellent. Gem is a shockingly good guitarist and really added a lot to it. Amazing. G's review of the gig can be found in the title heading above...  Today I received a fan letter from a guy, Timo, in Germany. He had heard the aggression on various comps and such and wanted to buy 'everything', but Tinman hasn't returned ANY E-mails to him. Horrible. I am so furious that I wanted to give this kid every record I have ever done. Sadly, Tinman hasnt returned any of MY emails and I have no cd's either. So i pointed him in the right direction and he is very appreciative. Timo is dead psyched for Chemlab. Me too, pally.  The season premiere of 24 was last night and WOW did it deliver. Jack Bauer: Heroin addict!??!!! I can't handle how good this show is. I have the Kiefer Madness like there is no tomorrow. This is the best show on TV in the past 10 years i think. Since AMERICAN GOTHIC, a lost classic featuring Gary Cole.  Back to the grind, kids...  F         "
"             Hello again, everyone (all nine of you.) I know it has been some time since I posted here, and you have missed my impersonal musings terribly. You feel neglected. But I swear I will not let it happen again. There are simply too many thrills and wacky misadventures in my life at the moment, and I would be remiss were I to spare you any of the gory details. So here it goes:   hypefactor: part deux  I spent a fair amount of time working on the new hypefactor record during the past month, although I was distracted in recent weeks by school, real life shite and some other musical projects. Most of the guitars are tracked on nine songs, however, and I plan to wrap up writing, production and rough mixing on most of the material by the end of this week. There are also two new songs waiting in the wings - 'Bitter Party Of One' and 'Down To Brass Tacks' - that, for the most part, have yet to be tackled by the team. Both originated from guitar parts I wrote while messing about on other songs, and while they are shamelessly poppy and breezy, I am hoping they make the record. The plan now is to tackle them once we are well underway with tracking live drums, which everyone wants to see happen this month. My fingers are crossed.  We took a bit of a hiatus from work at the Birdcage in late October because F.J. was compelled to make one of his usual pilgrimages to Los Angeles. I gathered Ash and Robin for a session last Tuesday, however, where we reviewed some old parts (such as new guitars for the chaotic 'Solar') and listened to some works in progress. But the bulk of our brief session was dedicated to 'Two Basses Thin,' which had become a thorn in my side as of late.  The song started during one of the June or July sessions with a basic acoustic/bass guitar motif jammed to inifinity, and was later expanded radically when Ash developed a slew of loops for a chorus. The result was somewhat messy in that we were left with two distinct sections that seemed incompatible, the tension between the two exacerbated by F's dense, seven-minute arrangement. The complexity of the thing had me both concerned and flummoxed for some time, and I found myself unable to write anything resembling a workable guitar structure, despite some excellent contributions from Robin and F.J. in the choruses.  The writer's block concerned me enough that I called in Robin and Ash to help me jam around the parts some more and see if the two sections could indeed be linked. At first, Ash also seemed put off by the arrangement, describing it as a 'mess.' I am not certain that he left the studio any less skeptical. But after an hour of playing, we tracked some lovely new E-Bow parts of Robin's and a new bass part of Ash's that seemed to make the transition more seamless. Having those two playing with me also gave me a much better handle on the chord structure, and I have now tracked a bunch of parts (on top of the 40 or so already there) that attempt to blend the verses and choruses melodically. I hope everything else thinks it works, because I still am not certain. We shall see at the end of this week after I have fleshed things out a bit more, assembled a working mix and circulated MP3s amongst the gang.  While I must leave now to write a paper about stress - in Portugese, no less - I will post again tomorrow in greater detail about some other recent work, including the hypefactor and Chemlab remixes, recent gigs (Spiritualized, Echo and The Bunnymen), record purchases (John Cale, Twilight Singers, Suede) and the continuing saga that is the hypefactor sessions. Until then, cheers.         "
"             Here I am. Been ill since my return from LA and have a houseguest in the form of Bradley J. Fox, so time is at a premium at the moment. We saw MYSTIC RIVER last night which was solid, but marred by a few flaws and an unncessary final 7 minutes. Also, Sean Penn has fallen into Pacino/DeNiro mode where he is starting to become a bit of a gimmick. Tim Robbins however, was quite good.  Anyhow, been using the sickly free time to just chill with S.O. and to also catch up on the mad rush of Chemwork that needs to be ready for the Pigface tour and the subsequent release of Oxidizer in January. Jared's been great in asking my opinion on things (like approving artwork and such) and I've been hectic doing the art for the new T-Shirts as well as for the new limited edition 'MACHINE AGE EP'. I've been really hands on with this release, working with Jared on sutures for it as well as the aggression (remember them) contributing a remix to the project. I did the remix, but then had to run to LA, so Brandt really took the reign and really brought it home. so kudos to him cause he saved this one. It's hot and the only place you're going to get 5 of the 6 songs on this bitch. The final track listening has a new song called BLACK SNAKE VOODOO HISS, two sutures, two ESM demos, and the remix of BINARY NATION we did. Hopefully Invisible will get this ready in time for the Pigface tour. Speaking of which, make sure you go to the NYC show, you might see yours truly onstage if all goes as planned.  While I was gone, Brandt took the downtime to flesh out some remixes of DISTRACTED era HF tunes. Quite simply, they are AMAZING and when done, will be made available for all to hear. IN a perfect world, the new album would have a bonus disc with the DISTRACTED EP plus the remixes. A  special edition if you will. Not light we ever signed a record deal for that anyways...  We have tickets to see Death Cab For Cutie tonight, but I might give my ticket to out friend from poontang who's apt went on fire and her ticket is now lost. She is a bigger fan than I am and I think this would make her happy.   Back to the grind this week. Now that the Lab stuff is just about out of the way, I'm aching to get back to the HF2 stuff.  F           "
"             LA's been a whirlwind of early morning and late evenings. Despite what it seems like, it aint all glamour. Spent some time visiting the set of the movie we've been working on for years that features The One in his next big genre role and co-stars with My Current Favourite Female Actress Who Lives Near The Pub (who I paid money to see in her new movie this past weekend). I could watch her run out of an SUV and into a bowling alley for HOURS. And I did...  Meanwhile, my free moments are spent helping put together this Chemlab EP, which I am doing the artwork for and having my two cents as to what should go on it. I must say I am digging the artwork, I've been having some great bouts of inspiration. Lucky. Jared better keep the title I came up with for this. Also, if he has them ready in time, you'll be wearing Chemlab T-shirts of my design quite soon.  I have a sun tan. Horrible. Embarassing. Though I got it while doing the AIDSwalk here in LA this past weekend with S.O.'s sister. Nobody walks in LA, so this was quite entertaining and moving at the same time. But the tan. jesus.  I think I may have forgotten to mention that the night before I left, we saw Spiritualized. Thanks to G owning LET IT COME DOWN, I am a recent convert to Jason's music and I regret missing their last tour (which BRMC opened). I love the epic and orchestral aspects to the music and I think his lyrics are quite funny. They have a new album, AMAZING GRACE, which is their stripped down rock album, and while I like it, it lacks a lot of the things I love about his music. The live show, unfortnately, reflects that new album and while his band is tight, he sits to the side and just plays without emotion. This totally took me out of the show. I'm not saying the guy has to be a showman, but stand up for chrissake! You're not Robert Johnson. Dude, come on. Get up. lazy Sod.  The Factor Corp. minus the CEO gathered in NYC last night. Maybe B will get the courage to post what went down in the studio while I wasn't looking ;-)  Just get me home. Quick.  F             "
"             I haven't forgotten you, I've been in LA doing the things that I guess I do. I spent a lot of the plane ride here working on the lyrics for a song now entitled THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Meanwhile, I have music to work on, but there has been so much material recorded recently that it's jamming up my sweet laptop. Speaking of which, I've worn the battery down to the bone so I stopped by Apple to grab me a new one and doubled the RAM in this bitch so it moves a bit faster. Feels good.  Spent a lot of time here with my friend the Famous Comic Book Writer who just gets better and better and is doing amazing job writing my all time favorite title TEEN TITANS. He is so good and such a sweet guy. We spend every Wed I'm in LA buying comics and hopefully we will be collaborating on something big in the future. He also has a cool wife and a very cool office which he shares with another cool comic writer you all read.   Meanwhile...for Mark Mohtashemi and a few others who asked, here are your answers on THIS:  'Greetings, wireheads:   Jared here. This is just a quick posting to explain why the CHEMLAB record’s taking so damned long to hit the streets. Jason and Jamie and FJ and I (along with a few other key noisists) had a fantastic, spring-wound, deepcut-groove time writing and tearing apart the trax that make up OXIDIZER. It’s a great record, very much in the vein of BURN OUT, while not imitating it. It updates and mutates and at its heart is a detonator coil set to go.   I’m really proud of it and everything that’s brought it this far. I want to make sure that all of Jason, Jamie and FJ’s hard work gets shown off in the best possible way, with the most power. However, everyone on the project felt that it got rushed at the end and needed more than we could give it at the time. It was a tough call but we’ve decided to bring in a second producer, Julian Beeston, to work with us on finishing off the record. This means that the record won’t be coming out until January but when it hits the streets, it’s guaranteed to be a multi-layered sonic beast even more improved by a second drag through the mixing desk.  To compensate somewhat for this disappointing delay, I’ll have copies of a limited edition EP with me on the Pigface tour. It’ll have a few trax on it that you might be interested in - a couple of trax from OXIDIZER, as well as two from some EAST SIDE MILITIA demos which I came across recently. The demos feature Geno and the late great William Tucker - very different versions than on the album, and they sound amazing!  Also, the official CHEMLAB web site will be up and running by the time I start the Pigface tour on November 5th. Be warned, it’s going to be in a state of mutation and freak-out for quite a while, shifting a lot as new discolorations are revealed. Check it out at www.hydrogenbar.com   OXIDIZER couldn't have happened without Jason, Jamie and FJ, and come January, I hope you’ll all agree that it was well worth waiting for. In the meantime, thanks for your patience.  Now hold still: here it comes...  jared'  A lof this was news to me, though now I'm hoping the remix in progress (now in the hands of Ash) makes it to the new EP. Timing is an issue and we will bust ass to try and get it on there in time. For the record, we (as the aggression, remember them?) are remixing the track BINARY NATION, one I co-wrote and play on, and is quite in the vein of BURN OUT AT THE HYDROGEN BAR. You'll dig it. Here is my comment on the EP from the Cracknation website 'The EP should be interesting. There's a ton of stuff from JCPS that they never used that I compiled for Jared some months ago off a beaten up old cassette that will be on this thing. I'm curious as to what he will pick as there is some crazy shit (and honestly, there is some stuff that would have REALLY made that album a lot better, including alternate takes and such, as well as tunes they never finished)'  Anyway, everything is cool and I am driving a convertable here in LA, which is another story in itself. Forgive me, but it's time to eat at C'Brea, my favorite place to eat in LA.  F  PS: Stu Hart, legendary patriarch of the famous wrestling family, passed away today. Owen, I'm sure is waiting in that ring in the sky waiting to thrown down with his pop again. Bless.         "
"             So Mr. G and I reunited to see KILL BILL yesterday. While I think I liked what I watched, I have to say overall, the film was disappointing. It lacks the cleverness and wit of Tarantino's other work. What I have always liked about his movies was his ability to put a new twist on American pop culture and make it ironic. In fact, that was the framework of his films and I believe the key to his success. However, by using Asian Cinema as his template, he is unable to get you invested in the film. And as some of you may know, I'm a 'bit' of a fan of Asian Cinema and let me tell you this, KILL BILL is more of an homage than it is a parody. It's not ironic, it's not clever, and there's really nothing cool about it. The ending blows too. I think if it had been one lone 3-4 hour movie, I could have been satisfied.   Then the rest of the day and evening became quite British and here's why...  1. G, S.O. and I had fish and chips for dinner from A Salt and Battery on Second Ave. This is quite possibly the best fish and chips in the City, though I am somewhat partial to the pub. Poor G had to miss the last crucial minutes of the Yankees so we can meet Matt and Jax and something called Dougie at...  2. The EDDIE IZZARD show. Holy shit is this guy a genius. For years I had no clue about him other than he dressed up like a chick and then one night in London Jared and his wife played me some of Izzard's videos and man is he a blast. Anyhow, this was our first time seeing him live (and matt's 50th time or so), and it was worth the hit. The man has an uncanny ability to seemingly make throaway jokes only to go back to them later and make them funny as hell. During his set he tackled everything from Racisim, cavemen, super heroes, transvestites, the planet mars, dentists, horses, fighting, air flight, did the worst yet funniest Christopher Walken impersonation ever and even made a funny joke about 9/11 (based on the fact that the rest of the world writes their dates with the DAY first and not the month, thus 'everyone was wondering WHAT exactly happened on November 9th!). Brilliant. The vibe we left with was so good. I think I was beaming from the laughter!  After a quick pit stop at the Tom aggression Birthday gathering, G and I met up with the Kidd, Ian Broon, and poontang to check out...  3. Saintface. Live. Taking a break from doing their album, the lads put on an entertaining rock show featuring all the ass shaking hits we love. They had a few technical snafus, which is always expected, but this is band which much confidence and energy and the tunes to back it all up. Later, I spoke at length with Peter Saintface about the album and while he told me which rockers are going on the refuses to tell me which ballads are being recorded for fear that I will 'pursade' and I am one of the few people who can 'sway' him. I am honoured to say the least. Things are looking up for this band and hopefully the album will be in all our grubby hands sooner than later. He and Michael Saintface both asked about HF2 and wheels should be set in motion upon my return from LA.  And now, a lazy day  F         "
"             In the wake of the recent rythmn section shake ups in Ass Cobra, which I'm sure is going to lead to some nasty shit amongst the MOGpac, Ash and Robin made their return to the Birdcage last night. Ash was hyper, Robin was not, so I knew they were both in the proper frame of mind to work. On the way down to the studio, I played them the new versions of 1956 and TWOBASSESTHIN. Both were met with enthusiasm. Everyone seems pleased with the direction the album is taking, but we all realize there is still work to be done. Oh yeah, and for the 4,000th time, we listened to Ass Cobra's DETROIT, which has supposedly taken 6 months to do.   I was happy to see B's friend Kid Who Looks Like Kid From Witness All Grown Up in town and chilling. He is quite fey yet handsome and I think because of that he pulls in tons of chicks. I was happy to find he had bought some chocolate donuts. He is quite thin and can live on these things. He watched MR SHOW and realized it wasn't that funny after all...  B and I had an agenda for these two and we put it in effect immediately. The first big decision was to cut almost 3/4 out of SOLAR and start from scratch. No one was happy with the song, so instead of talking about it for hours, we decided to just get rid of everything that was problematic and go at it again. Even I, who normally is adamant about keeping things, felt this made sense. I think the crew were a little surprised how agreeable I was. I'm not sure yet what this means for Link's sax parts, which concerns me a bit  Robin has been playing too much guitar lately, so I felt she needed a bass in her hands. I challenged Ash to stop playing guitar like a jazz half ass and to rock out a little bit. B sat in the corner, I think with a guitar, its hard to tell when Bat-Ash needs the lights off everytime we work. Ash and Robin switched back and forth between bass and guitar and the results were awesome. It took a really long time, which is kinda uncharacteristic for us, but it was worth it as we got the necessary parts to work with. Thanks to these two, we have a good verse and a really nice melodic bridge that (and I didn't say this to Ash at the time) sounds like The Cure.   During all this, I sat with a laptop, checking E-Mail, talking to a few folks online and looking bored . In reality, I'm jotting down ideas for arrangements, occasionally a lyrical idea, and listening VERY closely. Sometimes I'll just spring up and say 'THAT'S IT!' or 'NO NO NO'. Anyway, B will have to lay down his stuff (also quite good) and get all this to me before I leave for LA on Tuesday so I can hammer it into shape. After that, we'll figure out where this tune stands, but I think it's in really good shape.  It was late, but I wanted to flesh out EXIST because I just wasn't happy with the bass in the chorus. And you know its serious when it's ME playing the bassline I don't like it. At this point I was kinda tired, but I recall Robin laying down a lot of bass for me to play with. I also think Ash threw down some guitars.  Overall, it was a evening serious success. It wasn't like our usual sessions where the magic happens immediately. This was more about getting deep into the guts of two songs and mining the gold out of them. It's not easy. Robin referred to is as 'unproductive', though I countered that it's quality, not quantity, and Hypefactor got some real serious quality out of the kids last night.   My immediate task ahead is to work with the new stuff discussed above and to tweak 1956. I have written some lyrics for the song, which are actually the first for this album and now changes need to be made accordingly. In the meantime, the decision has been made to not write any more for this album until we have the live drums over the tracks. When we have that, we will then make the next round of creative decisions. I am hoping we can spend November getting the drums into shape. Then we will assess what we have and then go from there. I'm not putting any time restraints on this one. I want it perfect.  And perfect it shall be...  F           "
"             Hi Ashley:  After an early breakfast this morning with my old pal the famous Martial Arts Cinema historian/Author (who hated KILL BILL by the way), I decided to stroll through Times Square in search of inspiration for my mom's Birthday gift. I hadn't been up there since G, Matt and I spent an evening with Wrestling Superstar Who Used to Be Shinobi. Anyway, I am a die hard New Yorker, to the end hopefully, but there is some weird shit in Times Square. Based on my experience today, I would like to tell you that we live in a world in which:  1. Robert Evans has an animated series about his life (that's actually a plus). 2. Posh Spice shills for hip hop clothing. What the FUCK. 3. Why is my agent/lawyer/advisor spending money for me and my girlfriend to see 'A Boy George musical' that is also a 'Rosie O'Donnell production'. This is BROADWAY? Where are the actors? 4. Jason Patric on Broadway. Nuff said. And no, he's not an actor, he's a method half ass. 5. And to make it worse, he is 'acting' opposite Ashley Judd. 6. Bubba Gump Shirmp Company opens on December 6th. I'll be at Sardi's thanks.  This is all I can think of it. It was too much. I hate myself. Anyway, I ended up getting mom tickets to see Hugh Jackman looking crazy disco gay in THE BOY FROM OZ. and yes, I'm going too. Dan Hamill just told me 'Moms love singing fags'. I would have agreed with this, but Jackman IS Wolverine, so he's tops in my books.  My 'celebrity' sighting was Robert Sean Leonard who looks like my relative who married a woman to cover the fact that he loved men. There's nothing wrong with that! Stop it! Gay is OK. Where the hell are the real stars!  Anyway, this sent me packing right into the Virgin Megastore where they expected me to spend 30 bucks on the new John Cale album. Luckily, Amazon UK has it for like 14 bucks. Screw you Branson. I ALMOST bought the new Interpol single cause it's the Arthur Baker remix, but its just two song. Lousy. Luckily I came to my senses and ran home, where I now have to go meet my former student, Edward, who is a nice guy.  Two more remixes have arrived: The first one comes all the way from Japan. SINO, who you can read about in the new Industrial Nation, took an interesting approach to DREAMS TO DEATH and made it a nasty machine dirge. It's very simple, but effective and fits in real nice on the EP. In the meantime, the lads in Cyanotic delivered their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS and have taken a drum n bass approach to it. Solid. I'm really happy with it and it gives us something we don't have yet on the record. One thing I have learned from all this is that Tom's vocals remix really well. Remixers love the smooth vocals.  Meanwhile I am working on a remix for a band you all know and love but are curious as to where their new album is. I am just as curious to be honest with you as I thought I would have it by now. Who knows. I'll get back to you on that. Also, I'll report back tonight or tomorrow after we get the crew together at the studio. Lots happening with HF. Till then...  F         "
"             Despite my being distracted by Dan Hamill's discovery of classic wrestling on channel 70, the vision of the new Hypefactor album became significantly clearer with a whirlwind editing/arranging sessions yesterday at the Birdcage. With this session, two songs, 1956 and TWOBASSES took massive shape and now have the structure and guts they need to become excellent songs. I heard B's new guitar parts for 1956 yesterday and was really happy with them. As usual, there was a lot to listen to, and this actually led to my editing new sections of the song just based on his new guitar parts. This song is a stormer. Meanwhile, he was really into my weird arrangement for TWOBASSES, which is basically two songs now, and I think we are going to treat it as such. the first half is acoustic/electro and the second half is a Stone Roses-esque dance jam. But each part uses elements from the other. I'm REALLY psyched.   If all goes well, we should have the album laid out and ready for live drums in the next few weeks. of course, Ash will come in this week and kill the buzz by wanting tons of stuff changed (I mean this in a good way).  Meanwhile, S.O. and I caught up with Mr. G and we saw SCHOOL OF ROCK featuring the genius that is Jack Black. This movie is hilarious and makes the best use of the Jack Black gimmick, taking it to new heights. What made it even more interesting was watching these kids rock out and they knew how to really play. I'd be curious to see how they cast this movie (something, I'm sure for the DVD). Then we met up with members of poontang and sang Verve and Robbie Williams songs till the wee hours at the original MOG hang out O'Hanolans.  And now the best news of the morning:  Revenge/Monaco album announced  LTM are pleased to announce a deluxe 2xCD reissue of the sole album by Revenge, the electro/hard rock hybrid fronted by New Order bass player Peter Hook between 1989 and 1992. Following the release of Technique in 1989, the four members of New Order spent time apart to pursue other ventures. Always intended as a proper band rather than a solo project, Hook was joined in Revenge by Chris Jones and Dave Hicks, and later by David Potts, who would remain with Hook as part of Monaco five years later. Indeed in some respects Revenge can be seen as a dry run for Monaco, who went on to deliver a top ten album and single in 1997. One True Passion was first released by Factory Records in June 1990 and spawned a trio of singles, 7 Reasons, Pineapple Face and Slave. Given free reign to indulge Hook’s leather-trousered rockist instincts, the OTP material welded hard rock to dance beats, with a lyrical focus on sin and redemption. The artwork was just as contradictory, combining sleek Peter Saville typography with softcore imagery by Suze Randall. The band toured like bastards, and in January 1992 delivered the excellent ep Gun World Porn, which offered a more laid back, intimate feel. Deleted after the messy collapse of Factory in late 1992, One True Passion has now been retooled and reconfigured by Hook and Potts, and comes with a full-length bonus disc of rare remixes and unreleased songs in demo form. Standout tracks include 7 Reasons, Deadbeat, Big Bang, State of Shock, Pineapple Face and Jesus I Love You. All material has been carefully digitally remastered. The set contains over two hours of music, and the booklet includes sleevenotes by Joy Division/New Order biographer Claude Flowers.   I feel it appropros that in the middle of my second CD exploring these very influences that this retrospective is announced. Mega!  F          "
"             In DC for a few days. For the first time since S.O. lived here when we were wee kids in love, I took Amtrack down. However, thanks to some travel experience, was bumped up to first class, which was a delight. The tea was always handy, just like on Continental's first class flights, but the difference here is that a. you can use your cel phone and b. they have outlets for each seat, which for a guy like me who seemingly has become physically grafted to his laptop, is a blessing. This is a far cry from the last time I was on an extended train ride, which was in Mother Russia (see theaggression.com tour diary for details), however, the Russian dining cars are the BEST (right, Matt?).  Therefore, the 2 and a half hours on the Acela Train gave me time to work on the HF2 song TWOBASSES, which I have mentioned previously. It's a tough song with a lot of parts, so the bulk of my time was spent figuring out how to mesh the very fast part with the very slow part. NOT easy, but I made some headway and thus I am looking very forward to my train ride back to NYC (hopefully) this afternoon to get deeper into it. I think, and this is for those in the corp. reading it, I'm going to add little noises and such from the faster part and pepper them throughout the slower part for continuity. I sound like a chef.  Anyhow, I am staying at the Willard in DC. Fancy-ass hotel. Awesome. My lovely S.O. would dig the hell out of this place. But historically significant because it is the bar where Ulysses S. Grant would drink. All the politicians who wanted his ear would hang out in this lobby to wait for him to get him to sign off on things while he was wasted on rye. Hence, the term 'lobbyists'. How cool is that?! That's your history lesson of the day.  The kids in Cyaontic wrote me to say their remix for the aggression EP should be done today. I'll report on once they send me an MP3.  In the best news of the week, former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter and his Mrs. have had their long-awaited baby, a girl, who's name, at the moment I don't know how to properly spell, so I will refrain from trying. Needless to say, it's not F.J. Everyone is in good health. The Mom called me and she sounded like she had just come back from shopping, while the Dad sounded like he just did 4 tours of duty in Iraq. Hilarious. Bless! I have no doubt that S.O. is currently shopping for MORE for this new child, as my lovely girilfriend has bought more clothes for this baby than I have in my closet. But hey, kids are awesome. I get my lil cuz's on Sunday!  On the run.   F           "
"             Last night, at a hotel in lower Manhattan, I met the man who influenced me to pick up a bass guitar when I FIRST met him 12 years ago. It's no secret here who this person is, but needless to say he was a total gentleman who was funny and sweet. This brief conversation totally justified my musical existance. We discussed Hypefactor, bass playing and Gibson Thunderbirds. When he asked for a CD, I was floored. Kudos go to Irene (for giving me the last copy of Distracted Lover we had in the house, so I didnt have to rip down my framed copy), G (for coming along so I didn't look like a stalker), and B (tipping me off about the DJ set). It gets better as said bass hero is performing tonight here in NYC.   What a great moment. Thanks, Hooky!  Meanwhile, lyrics are bring revised and honed for HF2. I've been taking advantage of free moments during the Turkey break to focus on the written word. Yesterday, I shot some lyrics over to B and he came back with some positive feedback. Jazzed, by that, I began arranging what is now called OUR FAITH (title to change, though I hated calling it BITTER PARTY OF ONE). I have a decent intro and verse, so this morning I'll work on the choruses before being beaten by a 5 year old AGAIN (no complaints though!).  F             "
"             I write this with a headache a mile wide, so bear with me. With Irene off on a girls night (which I'm told was quite hilarious), I made my way back to the studio to with the intention to remix Saintface and work on a song Brandt's had cooking for quite a while now called BITTER PARTY OF ONE (That title won't last, I promise). However, Ash decided he had to buy his cats gourmet dried fish, so he wasn't going to make, thus that meant no remixing as he had the Face parts. Rrrrr. Thus, we decided to work on the new song..  It took Brandt FOREVER to load this song and all the parts up and I was bored out of my freakin' mind. When he did get the song up, I have to admit I wasnt nearly as pleased with the track as I was when I heard it many weeks back. So a lot of deconstructing went on. The first thing to go were Brandt's strings, which sounded way the hell too much like TKK. Brandt let his Wax Trax fascination get the best of him with this song. I had played some bass awhile back which I thought blew, so I spent a lot of time writing new parts. This took a long time, but I was able to write basslines for the verses and choruses, though the chourses went through a few revisions as the day went on.  At some point during all this, Brandt received a phone call from Ash, saying he was coming by 'in a half hour' to drop off the remix parts and I received a phone call from my old pal Jamie Duffy (on tour doing sound for Saves The Day) saying he also was coming by 'in a half hour'. Its interesting to see what 'in a half hour' means for these guys as they didnt show until many half hours later, and hours apart from each other.  Anyway, there was no way Jamie was going to hang out with us and not play, so after he spent 3 hours Instant Messaging people, we put a guitar in his hand and DAMN did he take this new track to the next level. He played the most UN-Jamie like guitars I have ever heard (I mean this in a good way). He played some 12 string as well as some E-bow and really added some sexiness to the track. I just left him and Brandt alone to make this track happen. Now the song went from Wax Traxy to sounding like Soda Stereo. This is good. Damn good.  Then it became the industrial This Is Your Life as the three of us had a big dinner discussing everything under the sun about Jamie's and my past in the world of machine rock (as we call it now). Some funny stories were told and I think Brandt got a kick out of hearing a lot of the behind the scenes stuff that has happened to us over the years.  And yes, Jamie confirmed the atrocity that was the aggression hotel destruction incident. Brandt was shocked that that story was NOT exaggerated.  Then it was drinks long into the evening at KGB bar, which was a good choice as the drinks are strong and priced reasonably and the place isnt overcrowded. Like Russia. I think.  All in all, a fun evening. Thanks, Kid!  F         "
"             The Face made their Knitting Factory Debut last night for an early show opening for someone called My Favorite (who have a bit of a following, I'm told). Well, I'm happy to report that Saintface was in excellent form and played a very 'hyper' (Irene's word) and 'Spirited' (G's word) set. As a musician who knows the band members well, I could tell that they were having a VERY fun time on there. The music was tight, the band was loose. That's how it should be. Plus, they closed with an oldie called YOU BELONG TO ME, which confirms my suspicion that it's popping up on the album.  Right, Peter?  I would like to add that Saintface have fallen into an old aggression trap. With the aggression, every gig was 'the last gig ever' and we'd play a month later. Saintface's gimmick is 'last gig of the year' and they play a month later. December 29th will be their third last gig of the year I think. Love it.  And yes, Peter, that was me who yelled 'Disco'. Sorry. I wouldn't do that if they weren't my favorite band.  Had a nice round of drinks after with my girl, G, brandt and Peter. Good times.  F         "
"             I miss you as well. But here I am.  Pigface, featuring Jared, came into town the other night. It was dilemma for me as we had tix for the Twilight Singers, who I dearly love, but I wanted to see Jared. Irene and I had a great sushi dinner with Jared, who I am always happy to see and have fun with. That was the highlight for sure. As for the gig, the crowd was dead, the venue blows and quite frankly, I feel like Pigface, other than as a promotional tour for Jared/Chemlab, is a dead topic at this point. Touring so soon after the last tour and touring the same market behind KMFDM (who I skipped intentionally when I found out they weren't playing Pig songs) was a huge mistake. Jared is a sole frontman and better off on his own and hopefully this tour at least gets people interested in Chemlab. I was invited to get up and sing CODIENE GLUE AND YOU with Jared (who treats me like a superstar, thanks), but legendary tampon jingle writer Siebold tried to boot me, obviously not paying attention to the fact that I was invited up. Kids stormed the stage, not helping with the confusion either, so eventually, I just sorta walked off the stage cause it was going nowhere. Maybe it was because the aggression was so much better than Douche Dept. when we opened for them. Just saying. And Curse Mckay? Thanks for the water. Dick.  Honestly, between us, I was nervous about going up, as this has been my scene since I was 18. Plus, I hadn’t been onstage in awhile. I was onstage maybe 2 minutes, tops. Irene and Matt were very protective of me post-leaving the stage as I guess I looked a bit frazzled. So my appreciation goes out to them. So while I’m thinking it was a humiliating experience, kids from the gig have been E-mailing me they loved the chaos. Go figure.  Anyway, post gig vibes were low, but thanks to a well-placed Text message from Mr. G, I was able to run down very quickly to catch the last hour of the Twilight Singers. Greg Dulli, fat and drunk, sang the new Outkast song and then played a bunch of Afghan Whigs songs. He was a mess. He talked non-stop. He doesn’t seem long for this world. I’m happy I saw this. I went to bed a happy boy.  The next night was back to the studio for some HF loving. THEY’VE JUST, the first song written for the new album, finally got the attention it deserved and is now a sweet, atmospheric song. Lotta soul to this one. Very pleased with it. 9 songs now for HF2.  Speaking of HF2: the new tentative album titles is EXIT STRATEGIES. You can figure that out on your own.  Last night, Irene found a great Vietnamese bistro for us to find solace in during a massive rainstorm before I headed over to the Coral Room to meet Ash and Brandt for the free Telfon Tel Aviv gig. This gig was nothing sort of EXCELLENT and the band impressed us with their ability to use live instruments instead of solely relying on a computer. Top notch, excellent music. Then I ran into Mike Burnlab, who did the artwork for the new Chemlab record and is a really good guy, so that was a nice surprise.  The evening ended at the Gramercy where Ash, Brandt and I had a very productive and positive discussion about all our different musical adventures. I left this summit quite jazzed and quite optimistic for the upcoming material. I wish everyone I worked with in music was as dedicated as these two (and Robinowitz).  Saintface tonight. More then.

"             I am going to be in some deep shit with this...  Jackie Chan in talks with government to construct a Jackie Chan village in Hong Kong over the next ten years  by Wu Chi Ming 2003.11.17  Jackie Chan took interviews with a few Japanese newspapers the other day, and revealed plans to cooperate with the Hong Kong government to construct a village (the Jackie village!) in ten years time.  The village could have a Jackie Chan museum and a movie themed park.  Jackie Chan's 'Shanghai Knights' opened the day before yesterday in Japan.  But because he was hard at work on 'New Police Story, Jackie was unable to promote the movie in person.  But he still attracted a large number of Japanese media who arrived in Hong Kong to interview him.  He accepted interviews from 'Sports Daily' and 'Sankei Sports' and disclosed his planned construction of the Jackie village in Hong Kong.  Each part of the facility [would be world class.]  Jackie Chan said, '...I plan a Jackie village!  Besides having a movie themed park, we could have a theater, a [sports area?] and a Jackie museum.  Jackie had originally had this idea on his mind for several years.  He said, 'Although Jackie Village is still in the planning stage, there has already been four or five meetings with the Hong Kong government.  The final plan isn't in cement yet, and I can't disclose details.  It was a secret!  There are still a lot of plans for the project.  Moreover, from the beginning until now it's been about two or three years.  I believe in order to complete the project it would take ten years!'  A few years ago there were rumors of plans to construct a Jackie Chan museum in Yokohama, but the plan was stopped.  Now Jackie has regained hope.  http://www.the-sun.com.hk/channels/ent/20031117/img/c21117_big.jpg         "
"             Sorry, been buried. But here I am for your stalking pleasure.  Chemlab is literally consuming my life. This is not a bad thing. Tons of work, E-mails flooding in and lots of new interest in my musical world from the kids. The Chemlab message boards are a lot of fun so far. Hopefully, no jackasses will go and ruin it. Thanks to this new exposure, a few aggression/HF cd's are being bought up and the talk of the chat boards is the new Chemlab 'MACHINE AGE' EP. Jared is out on the road with Pigface now selling it as well as the new T-shirts (can't wait to strap one of those on!). Finally, my copies of the EP arrived today thanks to the very nice Mike at Invisible and it sounds super. I think for a limited edition tour only item, this is the perverbial bomb, as they say. I'm  not 100% happy with the way my artwork was printed, but I have little to nothing to complain about. Its the first official Chem-release in years and I got to be a part of it. Now, onwards to Oxidizer in January...and beyond.  Hypefactor is no less busy. Tackling the song THEYVE JUST, now which has gone from moody acoustical thing to mini-Cure epic. Love what this is turning into. Its the last song to be developed before we being tracking drums. LOTS of inter-corp discussion about the drums, etc. Thats a new challenge for us as we have never directly recorded live drums for one of our projects before. It will certainly be educational. Ash has laid some of the groundwork for this with the Cobra's, but I think we're gonna do some really great stuff in the next few weeks. Robin's ready for this. I know she will come through big time. Also, Brandt has updated the news section of the site, so check that our and LEARN, asap!  Meanwhile, the aggression (remember them) have been informed by the label that the THESE MILLION NIGHTS EP is on the schedule for early 04 (to capitalize on the chemlab association, I'm sure), so I've started prepping the art for it. We're not sure if it's going to be in a slim jewel case (like DEVIATIONS), which is my preference, or in a regular CD5 case, so as soon as I know, I can go full out on the art. the cover is ready. I'm looking forward to getting back into that world for a bit. I think the label has a few of their artists doing some remixes for this, so we might end up with maybe TEN remixes on this mother. Quite the bang for the buck.  And no, i will not comment on Paris Hilton. Now back to Cerati  F             "
"             Out of touch, but a little bit of time, so here I am...  Took a quick post-24 runner over to the studio the other night to make some cosmetic changes to SOLAR (yes, the real title), 1956 (yes, the real title), and EXIST (yes, real title). When listening to the versions that came out from Saturday's awesome session, I realized a few tweaks needed to be made. EXIST in particular, needed a bit of a change in the intro as the post-saturday one, as S.O. pointed out, sounded exactly like a certain song by a British artist of some note. I went and got the song in question and sure enough, she was right on. It was a minor tweak, but worth it.   SOLAR, the album closer, had a bit too much Hookbass in it, so to keep the impact of that sound fresh in the song, I took stuff I had written for the verses out. There's a great ending to this song, which could be compared to The Cure in their prime. To flesh this section out, B played some sweet piano over it.   I was only in the studio for a few hours, but they were hours well spent.  Now we are trying to formulate a gameplan for the next stage, meaning, its time for the live drums for the first 7 or so songs. Also on the agenda will be to write a track in the rehearsal space with the full band. I had wanted Peter Saintface to get on on this part, but he is neck-deep in the 'Face record, and we're gonna have to be patient while he does his thing there. If I didn't want that Saintface record so badly, I might be upset ;-)  While all THIS is going on, the Chemlab machine is in full swing. The new mixes came in from Jared and Joolz and I'm pleasantly surprised that they were able to take a Chemlab album and mix it to sound even MORE like Chemlab. I wish I had been there, but my comments, as always, are nitpicky. Meanwhile, the new website, complete with message board, is now functioning and I find myself posting left and right and innundated with instant messages about the album, the ep, and anything else related to it. The kids are jazzed for this album and I'm confident it will deliver. Meanwhile, Jared is getting the EP ready in Chicago and I myself am dying to see and hear the final result. I worked on 4 of the 6 tracks and did the artwork for it. It's the first thing kids are going to hear from the new Lab and I am (understandably) excited and paranoid at the same time.   The fan who wrote from Germany wrote to tell me that Tinman wrote him back and he has ordered his aggression CD's. Good! Now watch, he'll fucking hate it...  F           "
"             For the first time in weeks, I made it down to the studio to get back to work on HF2. I had so much energy because I had been itching to get back into it. Hit the ground running and finally did the long awaited arrangement on 1956, which is now a lean mean fighting machine. Of the course of two hours, every time Brandt and I would say 'it's done' and play it back, we'd get a new arrangement idea. We shaved a minute and a half off of it, and I'm loving it. Then B played me the new parts to TWO BASSES that they did while I was away and I was really into and was double pleased I didn't have to change a thing in the song. They've really smoothed that tune out and made the two very different parts appear to be seemless. Awesome work.  My next task was to tackle the new intro to EXIST because the newest version B sent me seemed messy. He has so many cool parts in it that it became just a matter of giving them room to shine in the intro. Quick work. I then extended the bridge Robin and Ash wrote for the song, simply because it deserved more ear time and is quite possibly the best 20-30 seconds of the album. Nuff said.  Then, as a nice surprise, Robin and Ash appeared and the band was in full swing. We first just reviewed the songs as everyone had notes (well, ash actually had writtern notes) and comments on the new mixes. Everyone is almost on the same page and even where we're note on the same page, we're at least in the same chapter of the book and quite close. Which is really good. Once we were done reviewing the tracks and set a gameplan for the day, we listened to some of our recent non HF work (i.e. Chemlab and Ass Cobra) and hammered out some internal MOG politics, which is wack, but has to be done sometimes. However, I'm happy to report I'm digging the Cobra.  Then we got back to the problematic SOLAR, which is less and less problematic finally. Robin recorded some new basslines for it while Ash and I watched New Order at Finsbury Park on DVD and checked out the new Peter Saville book. Awesome stuff. Watching the New Order gig sparked a new musical idea that everyone seems down with. Anyway, Robin did an amazing job and then I laid down some hooky goodness over some of the stuff. I now have the parts loaded up and will spend the next few days trying to bring that tune together.  All in all it was a successful evening. We now have 9 songs for the new album. 7 of them are ready for live drums and the other 2 are close. We will probably need one or two more songs. I've given us no timeline to finish this record. Its too good to rush. I've learned my lesson before, but on the flipside, I'm not going to let it go TOO long.  And now, some rest...  F         "
"             There's a lot of HF going down, right now actually. However, I need some sleep. Will report tomorrow about today's awesome sessions with the crew. However, here is further info on what is easily for me the first great release of 2004...  February 2004 sees a deluxe 2xCD reissue of the sole album by Revenge, the electro/hard rock hybrid fronted by New Order bass player Peter Hook between 1989 and 1992. Following the release of Technique in 1989, the four members of New Order spent time apart to pursue other ventures. Always intended as a proper band rather than a solo project, Hook was joined in Revenge by Chris Jones and Dave Hicks, and later by David Potts, who would remain with Hook as part of Monaco five years later. One True Passion was originally released by Factory Records in June 1990 and spawned a trio of singles: 7 Reasons, Pineapple Face and Slave. Given free reign to indulge Hook's leather-trousered rockist instincts, the material welded hard rock to dance beats, with a lyrical focus on sin and redemption. The artwork was just as contradictory, combining sleek Peter Saville typography with softcore imagery by Suze Randall. The band toured like bastards, and in January 1992 delivered the excellent ep Gun World Porn, which offered a more laid back, intimate feel. Deleted after the messy collapse of Factory in late 1992, One True Passion has now been extensively reconfigured by Peter Hook, and includes Hook's new recordings of the late period unreleased tracks The Wilding and Televive. The set comes with a full-length bonus disc, Be Careful What You Wish For, with lots of rare remixes and unreleased songs in demo form. All 30 tracks, over two hours of music, have been carefully digitally remastered. The booklet includes sleevenotes by Joy Division/New Order biographer Claude Flowers, and a new, highly candid interview with Peter Hook on the background of the band. FOR RELEASE FEBRUARY 2 2004.    | tracklist 01 Televive (unreleased) 02 The Wilding (unreleased) 03 Deadbeat 04 State Of Shock 05 Little Pig (Remix) 06 Cloud 9 07 Jesus I Love You (B-side) 08 Pineapple Face 09 Big Bang 10 Slave 11 14K (B-side) 12 Bleachman 13 Surf Nazi 14 7 Reasons (Demo) 15 It's Quiet  01 Underworld (unreleased) 02 Deadbeat (Gary Clail Dub Mix) 03 State Of Shock (US Dance Mix) 04 Pineapple Face's Big Day Out (US Mix) 05 The Trouble With Girl (compilation track) 06 I'm Not Your Slave (Remix) 07 Hot Nights/Cool City (unreleased) 08 Surf Bass (unreleased) 09 Paris '68 (unreleased) 10 Bleach Boy (B-side) 11 Soul (unreleased) 12 Kiss The Chrome 13 Fag Hag 14 Precious Moments (unreleased) 15 Pumpkin (unreleased)   This will ruin me.

"             Well, Saintface finally had what they claim will be their last gig of 2003 (I'll believe THAT in 2 days), and it was a true test for the band in that they were plagued (and I mean PLAGUED) by technical difficulties that reminded me of the aggression's 2001 comeback gig in NYC. However, I think the 'Face's problems stemmed from the fact that there was incompetence at work at this venue, Sin-E (most famous recently in mogworld as the place where Irene and Anna watched Ed Norton play guitar), and the soundperson basically was either totally new to the club or a homeless person just brought throught the door. There was just too many problems for it to be a regular club problem. HOWEVER, as Irene astutely pointed out, to their credit, the face never missed a note or a beat and were able to keep the energy going. i can relate that it is terribly frustrating to have your momentum fucked with like that, and knowing Peter, I could see the energry draining from his face towards the end, but this is a true test of a band and these guys passed with flying colours. I was also very happy to see the guitar player is REALLY coming into his own and is really becoming a solid presence onstage with the 'Face. He was worth the wait.  They ended with YOU BELONG TO ME again, which confirms my suspicion that this will make it to the album. If not, a cover of it will end up as a hidden track on the new Hypefactor. You've been warned, Peter. Just go finish the goddamn album already, or at least give me the rough mixes to keep me happy. Please.  Peter also serenaded my little sister during this gig and implied several times from the stage that she was with child. She is about 80 lbs soaking wet, so I am confused, yet supremely entertained by this. I was going to ask him what that was all about, but I think I enjoy the mystery much more...  Anna and G went on their way, but Irene and stuck around to check out My Favorite, who have a bit of a buzz these days. I'm happy to say it was worth the wait, as they were quite good. We didn't stick around for the whole set, but I did buy Irene the CD (which I had been contemplating before she expressed her interest). My Favorite are quite good in what we in the MOGpac would call a 'John Hughes' kinda way. It's very 80's soundtracky with a solid band and an excellent young lady, Andrea, doing lead vocals. The bassist occasionally dabbled in a Tones on Tail basstone and the guitarist, who looked like he stepped out of my old High School, was VERY good. I feel bad for the accordian player though, he looks quite bored and upset, but was really good on the 2 songs he was allowed to play on. However, the weak link, believe this or not is the main guy, who sings and plays keyboards. He was like everyone one of those Jon Cryer characters from the 80's who never got the girl and then in his 30's decided to start a band. I hate to say this, cause it's obviously his fucking band, but he annoyed the shit out of me. i can't tell if he's doing this all tongue in cheek or not. Unfortunately he's all over the album, but is less annoying. But they should just let this girl sing everything, she's a gem. I won't rush out to see them (cause of this guy), but if they play with Saintface again, I'm sure we'll stick around. Maybe I can adjust. Sorry. I don't mean to sound like a douche here, its just that I really like the songs and the band and especially when the girl sings. ugh. Sorry.  My day starts off on a sad note, as I wake to see news photos of my hero Jackie Chan mourning the death of his friend the famous HK pop star/actress Anita Mui, who passsed away yesterday from complications of Cervical Cancer. Horrible. She was only 40. She moved me to tears when she acted opposite the also recently deceased Leslie Cheung in the classic ROUGE. She was BRILLIANT as Jackie's love interest in MIRACLES and hilarious beyond compare playing his stepmother (!) in DRUNKEN MASTER 2. She was supposed to be in Zang Yimou's next film with Andy Lau (who she shared the screen with in one of my old favourites SAVIOUR OF THE SOUL, which Irene recently bought for me on DVD), Zang Ziyi, and my current favorite Asian film star Takeshi Kaneshiro. This is a big loss for the HK film community and the world itself. That's her quote above...  F         "
"             I've not forgotten you, but I'm sure you, like me, have been busy with the holidays. What I learned this year having a live in girlfriend is that my family at the holidays now perceive me as an 'adult' which to me is a four letter word. However, this means now that 'we' meaning myself and Irene, have to go and buy gifts for everyone in my family. This is not an easy task and I have newfound respect for my mother, who has been doing this for decades on my behalf. As an only child, it was wasy for my mom to tack on my name to gifts she had bought for for my relatives. Irene, to her credit, and in spite of an insane work schedule, somehow managed to steer the ship to success. I did help even with the flu. However, now, instead of getting gift cirtificates and such (cause no one knows what the hell to get me anyways), I get things like gift baskets. What the hell is THAT...even Irene's adorable nephew, who is 5, bought me a shaving kit because 'I'm always visiting'. Actually, i thought that was kinda cool.  Despite now getting 'adult' gifts, Irene managed to keep the 12 year old in me quite happy on Christmas with lots of Star Wars and wrestling gifts. And of course, she got me the Ash-Recommended Bose Speakers for the Apt, which is going to get us kicked out of here. I have them at 2, and its blowing the roof off this place.  However, next year I'm going the route of the 5 year old and making lists.  I'm slowly catching up on things, mostly non-music stuff, cause Brandt is out of town till Mid January, so we're on a sorta hiatus. However, Brandt and Robin had a productive initial drum recording session while I was sick. While I have yet to hear, both reported good things from it, Robin in particular was very excited. It was then when I realized that this was out first time recording with her as a drummer!! Well, its about time, yeah? Anyway, Ash reports to me that B left the drum recording set up intact, so we might head in there soon to do some more. Hopefully.  I wish I had more to report, but sadly, the holidays make things crazy quiet. Been catching up on my Asian cinema, and watched the first two INFERNAL AFFAIRS back to back. Awesome stuff, though I'm worried how they will handle the third one.  Anyhoo, I'll be around later  F         "
"             This comes all the way from our new friend Timo, who lives in Berlin, who I mentioned a few posts back about having trouble getting our CD's. Well, looks like he bought himself the entire catalogue! Here's what he had to say (slightly edited)  'hello F.J.  the hypefactor record totally makes my day at the moment. i don't know what to say.....it is such an amazing piece of soulful and of honest music - yeah, this might just sound pathetic but damn, it is without the shadow of a doubt an incredible effort and i wanted to let you know. listening to the ep i really start to think it was absolutely about time that you did something on your own. this is your counterfeit ep. well kinda, but a thousand times better. distracted lover so totally takes me away, this doesn't happen too  often anymore. i am sure i love it as i love the last crack record and man, i truly dig that one.....  i love the hommage to some of the 80s heroes like smiths and new order and just how you turn these so wonderfully around and take out the best from those and give it a 2k3 facelift and throw in all of your honest feelings and thoughts and damn......awesome. i might just not find the right words, F.J., i am sorry. but hey, one thing's for sure. YOU DID IT.  as for the  the aggression material, i almost love flood album as i do love the distracted lover ep, hell it is so mad. there's so many new elements to be discovered that just aren't to be found on the forst two records and i absolutely salute that. it is x times more playful, more versatile, more achterbahn, more  progressive, more of an original sound as on the old ones. i hardly know a band that's joyfully making music industrial-style like YOU, yeah, you hear that all the way thru the album from the first second on, there's musicians at work who do it from the core and from their very hearts. flood has turned out a killer album and you guys deserve a whole fucking lot more recognition (well that's clear anyway, you sure don't need me to tell;-) for your music and your art.  i really like the two old albums as well. i have to say my faves on the debut aggro are the very last track ('permanent' - for its come armageddon, come, come, nuclear bomb - atmo) and the (quasi-hidden) chicago drinking song, that's a fantastic moment. the salvo remix on the remix album is killer as is the cydonia remixis really awesome!  damn, i almost forgot the precious little gem being the deviations single. highly inspired and decently worked out fuck-with-yous, like that one a lot, too. as i mentioned before, i somehow dig the very last remix totally. what  a twisted fucker. cuckooland supreme.  come on, F.J., i want an honest answer, you have been playing with the thought at making a full-length hypefactor album, haven't you?! can't wait for that to happen....'  He's going to be a happy Timo in 2004, I think ;-)  F  PS: 'cuckooland supreme' is the best description of Ash I have EVER heard!            "
"             Sorry, its been so long, but thats not to say there isnt anything exciting going on. Honestly, I'm just happy to be back in NYC for an extended period (maybe 3 weeks max), so two of those weeks are going to be vacation. Brandt, who I think is recording drums right now with Robin, is going back to Chicago, so i will be forced to actually relax and not work on music for a bit. I have a bit of reading to get caught up on, so thats the plan at the moment. However, Leo v23 has been recruited to perform on one of the newer tracks. Dead excited about that one.  Chemlab is officially out on January 27th. It's available for pre-order now, which I was excited to see. I am really looking forward to the reactions that will flood the Chemlab and Acumen newsgroups in the weeks that follow the album's release. I'm supposed to rap with Jared tomorrow, so I should know more about what the gameplan is, etc. for 04. I'm also told he has the new Watts album, and I'm determined to scam this unreleased gem from him.  Speaking on unreleased gem's Chris Connelly, a gentleman if there ever was one, has sent me a copy of his new album NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE, which is quite simply, nothing short of excellent. As I mentioned to Chris yesterday, this new one, co-written and produced by the amazing Chris Bruce, shows Connelly at the height of his vocal and songwriting powers. It's a nice balance between his previous solo work in SHIPWRECKED and his recent album PRIVATE EDUCATION. I know a lot of the kids want him kicking and screaming Revco style, but goddamn I love this man's solo work beyond belief.  Saw Return of The Bing last night and it was quite epic and the filmmaking was excellent. However, as much as I enjoyed it, LOST IN TRANSLATION is still my pick of the year (and probably cost the same amount of the the hobbit's rubber feet in the Lord Of The Rings)  And now, some rest, but more sooner than later...  F             "
"             Greetings from LA. I hear y'all might have some snow there...just a rumour I've heard while driving around in my convertible.  Not much to report other than I'm working non-stop, but I am happy to say I just got back from seeing THE LAST SAMURAI at Mann's Chinese Theatre (THE best place to see movies here, arclight be damned), and godDAMN was this movie incredible. I don't think it's any secret that I have a love of the Asian culture, and I felt this movie successfully told a great story and respected the world and culture of the Japanese quite well. Cruise was phenomenal as well, mad intense. This is rivalling LOST IN TRANSLATION as my movie of the year (only cause I have yet to see THE BROWN BUNNY). Anyhow, I strongly urge you to see this film. Quite moving stuff.  On music note, has anyone heard the new Die Warzau track, RADIATION BABIES? What a smoking return from one of the all time greats. Keep your ears open for this one.  Irene tells me the new Connelly album is waiting in my mail at home, as if wanting to get home to her wasnt enough, now theres an awesome new CD waiting there. ugh.  And yes, im working on music in the free moments. Listening to the demos and writing words and such. I'd like to think my colleagues have figured out when they are recording drums, but for some reason I doubt it...  And now for some long awaited sleep. Be well all.  F         "
"             Been spending some time hanging out with Irene at home and working on loops for Jared's new project, which I think he would describe as 'broken word'. He's working with Mark Spyby of Dead Voices on Air, and they've asked me to send them loops and noises and such to work with. I've drafted B into this as well. I've got some ideas flowing, certainly enough to send them in the next few weeks. Dunno anything more about the project than that. However, it's nice to be asked to be a part of it.  My pal Gilez, he of the reknowned Armalyte Industries, was kind enough to send me a copy of his label's latest release: Haloblack's THROB. This version is slightly different than the one I've had for a year or so. The final version has an new track called FEEL which might be the best track on the album. It's fast and synthy and sexy and different for Bryan and co. Honestly, the album needed this as well, as the pacing is a bit on the trip hop side. However, that works for me as I quite like the album. Also, a track I hadn't heard called PERMANENCE towards the end really adds some nice atmosphere to the album. The production is super and the mastering job is top notch. It's 'throbbing' out of my new Bose speakers right now (thanks Irene).Of course, the Raymond Watts cameo is always welcome. As I have mentioned elsewhere, I am curious to see how the die-hards respond to it, especially after reading some of the reactions to the Chemlab album (which range from 'I love it' to 'I like it, but it's not Chemlab').  Grabbed the new CURE box set and was quite pleased with that. The sound is great and while I am a big fan, I didn't own anything on this other than maybe the song from the CROW soundtracks. Therefore, this package is a big win. I'm weird and very unlike my mates with certain bands like The Cure and Depeche Mode in that to me their later years are more interesting to me than the early stuff. I mean, you KNOW Matt Gentile (even if you dont know him) sits around listening to STANDING ON A BEACH and SPEAK AND SPELL while I sit around listening to WISH and SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION, thinking these are the classics. Anyway, this Cure Box has given me an appreciation of those early years and a lot of solid remixes and B-sides from the later years to make me happy. This Box is a winner.  Made a trek out to my birthplace last night in Brooklyn, to check out the 'Face at some club for hipsters. It was an awesome venue, with a large stage and nice sound, and this made very a VERY solid evening of Saintface. Big crowd too. Cheap drinks as well. Two hipsters were dancing next to me. The venue and atmosphere obviously amped the band up quite a bit as they gave one of their best performances I have ever seen. Also, the re-introduction of YOU COULD BE MY SECRET was ace. I wonder if that means its on the album, Peter? Anyway, I think band was in good spirits and always my time spent chatting away with the lads is always welcome. Peter informs me the album is progressing nicely. Oh how I want that album!   After, G and I, with a few pints each in us, ran to a KFC drive through while they were closing and each bought a biscuit. They had no honey, which G was very pissed off about, but they had plenty of butter spread, which i threw at Matt and Jax. All and all a fun evening.  Now I am off to the Isle of Long to watch me drummer in action as we record her for HF2. More later on that.  F         "
"             Vocal demos continued through the weekend, with the heat at the studio going in and out at will. I love NYC. Robin came in to lend her support and spatula as I sang my ass off on tracks like ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION DAYS (though I might have to write another chorus for that one). This session didn't go as effortlessly as the first session the other day, but Brandt pushed me and pushed me until I hit notes that I never knew I could hit. Again, it's a thumbs up all around from the crew on the lyrics and melodies, which are key. I think Ash will hate the lyrics and melodies, which is usually a good sign in my eyes ;-P  Listened to some more of Robin's drum tracks thus far and I'm quite frankly blown away by what she brings to the tabel. What a musician this girl is! I tell you, she's the shining star on this album. I need 5 more of her. Clone this woman! This weekend, our intention is to get Robin going in earnest on the drums.   Team Obscene (a MOG subdivision consisting of MOGpac members Matt, G, the kidd and myself) gathered last night for the first time in ages to watch some sport and play some vids. Kudos to Matt Gentile for getting me past the VICE CITY board I had been stuck on for an ENTIRE YEAR (i wont say which, for fear of embarassment). And now the adventure (and howling laughter in my home) will continue. Also, my Pac exclusive Christmas presents have gone over quite well with the troops!  An E-mail came in from former Skrew!frontman Adam Grossman today, always a welcome presence in my mailbox. Such a good guy. I think I may have mentioned I saw Skrew more than any other band ever. I think Saintface after this week beats that record believe it or not. Lets toast to both bands.  F         "
"             'As of last fall, I am no longer writing music with nor working in the studio with Ministry. After the last tour- and years of collaborating with Al and everyone else we've worked with-I've decided I need to work on other music . So, I AM working on music right now in my studio in Austin. But don't worry. Distortion Rules.' --Paul Barker   So, Barker leaves Ministry. 18 years and a few classic records. While Peter Hook inspired me to pick up the bass and play in that style, the first basslines I learned were Barkers. In fact, the first thing I ever programmed was the drumbeat to Lead Into Gold's FASTER THAN LIGHT. It was he, in the legendary IN CASE YOU DIDNT FEEL LIKE SHOWING UP video, that inspired me to save my money to get myself the Gibson Thunderbird bass that I still play today.  So where does this lead? What exactly IS Ministry now? Was the sum better than the parts? We're going to find out soon as Ministry has a record due out in May. I fear the metal. Paul's Pink Anvil album last year, admitted even by Barker himself as a throwaway, was crap, but again, Barker's Lead Into Gold is probably one of my all time favorite projects EVER. It's no secret my one remaining Holy Grail in music is the lost Lead Into Gold EP called LOW AND SLOW. I'm hoping Barker doesn't stray into metal territory. Actually, I feel the same way about Al. The worst part of this is now the oft-discussed RevCo reunion is now off. That's the true crime.  I hope Al and Paul both continue to entertain us for years to come, but I want to love it the way I did in my youth. Inspire me!  F           "
"             With a big sigh of relief, I re-entered the birdcage yesterday to get back to work on HF2. Sadly, the special guest couldn't make it as his mother was making him a going away dinner (note: hes not living here on this side of the planet any more). However, plans have been made to give him loops and such and he WILL appear on this record. And we need him. He's talented, classy and foreign.  So this left Brandt and I to our own devices and the first thing we did was listen to the rough tracks of the inital drum sessions. I'm happy to say the test run was a success and Robinowitz is well on her way. I have some new ideas on how to push her buttons creatively, and we should be implementing those ideas as well. I have referenced recent Gustavo Cerati live show bootlegs as our benchmark for drum/electronic combos.  So B, knowing in advance I was interested in beginning some vox, had the mic and gear set up. It took till 3 am, but I laid down some scratch vox for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, SOLAR and what is still called TWO BASSES. This was more to see where my voice is at these days and to see if the melodies and lyrics I had this far for the album worked. Well, Brandt seemed happy with the melodies and lyrics, and hes a fucker when it comes to this stuff, so I think we're at a good point. I'm also happy my voice has gotten stronger with age, or maybe I just know how to use it better. Brandt says I'm hitting 70% of my notes, which for me is a miracle this early in the game.   What will happen now is that I will listen to mp3's of the tracks with vox for a few weeks before cutting the next round of vox. Thats usually when I hit my 95% (the rest is technology at play). But it's off to a good start, and I'm also ready to work out ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION PHASE as soon as I'm back in the studio.  Happy to report the long awaited REVENGE 2CD set finally arrived yesterday and godDAMN was it worth the wait. I've been living a lie for 12 years as it turns out the entire previously released tracks from their second EP GUN WORLD PORN were all in fact edits and the original versions appear here for the first time ever. Brandt and I almost shit our pants hearing the full version of STATE OF SHOCK (a lost classic). So much of Hook's bass was cut out. Whoever was responsible for that should be killed. Immediately. Anyway, this disc is the best.  I'm enjoying some time at home with Irene and hoping to get into the new Primal Scream bio should I grab a few free moments. Hopefully it's good.  I'm sure we will be discussing Chemlab soon as the album is just starting to get to the kids who pre-ordered. The reactions will be curious.  For the die hards: I have corresponded more with Mark Mohtashemi this week than I have in the past 8 years. I'll let you speculate.  blog blog.  F         "
"             I'm back in NY after a whirlwind week of LA and San Fran. Needless to say, I am quite sleep deprived, but always productive and always plotting and scheming. Of course, things happen, and I try to share them with you.  While on the plane to LA, I finally got the inspiration for lyrics and melodies for the one HF song that was giving me trouble, CREATION PHASE. There's a lot scribbled on paper and I'm actually about to go put it into the computer so it's legible. Then I'll play with it. However, this gave me the confidence to decide it's time to start scratch vocals. We've been incredible slow of late and it's time to kick it into high gear. Everyone is back in the same place, so hopefully we can make some big leaps, especially with the drums and vocals. I know Robin is game. First day back in the studio is tomorrow and I'm hoping we have a special guest in there, as he promises to show up.  Also on the plane flight, I found myself in a sound design mood and started creating some really interesting loops that might lead to the long discussed EK-7 project. This one will be for the 'kids', if you know what I mean. However, I have to see if a certain someone knows how to wrap his fingers around a guitar again to see if my masterplan can come to life. We'll be talking more about this later in the year.  Had dinner with my agent/lawyer/advisor and our old friend LeoV23, who was a happy to inform me that his new project, AM PACIFIC, has begun and slipped me a demo. ohhh, I'm a happy boy as Leo usually never fails. He hasn't this time either. It's a continuation of his adventures as Sutra, but it expands on the sound, adding horns and a new female vocalist. He seems quite committed to this as a full time band and you know I'll be the first one checking it out.   Leo was packing a one two punch as he announced, thanks to my encouragement, that he and Krayge are FINALLY going to re-master a V23 best of and put it out this year. He might even get the very cool Warzone Demos on there as well. The versions of BLACK SKY and VALUE on that were mega. I hope they make it on there. I really have to ride Leo to make sure this all happens as I have been bragging on the boards (with Leo's approval) about this. You coldwave kids are in for a treat with this.  Thanks to the ever helpful Mike at Invisible/UI, I finally have a copy of the final real manufactured OXIDIZER in my hands. I am a happy camper to say the least. The mastering, which I hadn't heard and had no idea about, is very very good and the record sounds crisp and punches hard. INV actually spent some money and printed the art on nice glossy paper. Make it feel special. I think its ironic that I first heard the final album in LA as I spent the bulk of my work on the album (loops, listening to mixes, etc) from LA for some reason. Anyway, the chapter is closed and the jury will be decided. I know I can sleep at night loving this album. Despite all the chaos and drama, it was worth it. And a flying V to anyone who doesnt like or get it.   I hoped I would come home to find the two CD Revenge set waiting for me. Sadly, not yet. However, I am dowloading new Ass Cobra Demos. There is a God. I think.  Irene has a friend who has a friend dating Hong Kong star Anthony Wong. This is too much for me to handle. Too much.  I'm sorry to cut this all short, theres more, I think. I just need to get re-adjusted to the cold.  F         "
"             I have to admit, I have been musically unproductive as of late. That's mostly because of the holidays and everyone is scattered, etc. There was a loose gameplan to try and record some more drums this week. The drummer and I were up for it, but Ash didn't feel comfortable doing it without Brandt, and it might have been more of a hassle than productive. Also, one of Ash's many projects, the glitch-y sounding Carbon Framework, which is quite good, has been picked up by a label and he has to rush some material out for a 12 inch. Congrats Ash!   Meanwhile, the musical behind the scenes always keeps me busy. I had my first Chemlab hissy-fit this week, for reasons I can't reveal, but unlike the aggression, where I treat everything like a soap opera, I tried to not be melodramatic about this. Like every album or band, there have been a few hiccups along the way, some I brush aside, others I tackle full on. In the aggression, I'm the 'boss' so it means juggling 100 different things. In Chemlab, I'm able to focus more on certain things, while Jared, as 'boss' focuses on the many issues. I think my job with Chemlab beyond the music is to give perspective, which is why Mr. Novak suggested my 'quality control' credit on the album. I should give Ash or Brandt one of those on Hypefactor, maybe? (no fuckin' way!)  Sadly, but not life-threatening, Chemlab has been moved back 2 weeks. Usually it's time to blame the label, but this time its Caroline's fault. No surprises there. However, this is locked now. February 10th. I'm happy with today's reaction on the Chemlab site to the song BINARY NATION, which started in this very computer. I think this is one the kids will latch on to when they get the album. Very proud of that song. I've gotta learn to keep my gob shut when the narrow-minded dumbasses spuzz their stupid thoughts on the music on the sites. I feel like the defender of the cause. Well, you can't make everyone happy, I understand this, and I know people aren't going to love everything you do, but for fucks sake state the opinion with some intelligence ONCE. We'll get the point. Douches. However, that's just a small portion of the kids. I've beeen getting a lot of nice and well-thought out feedback from people. Even if they don't like it, I like that they really put their minds to it and gave it a fair shot.  Anyway, the point of all this is that OXIDIZER is now available for pre-order. If you're smart, order it via the Hydrogenbar.com site. I'm hoping to have some copies next week, but Mark Mohtashemi and The Kidd might blow gaskets if I don't give them copies soon.   Speaking of Pre-Orders, Haloblack's THROB is also available for pre-order (see www.thesickcity.com for details). I point this out because the album is being released by my dear friend Gilez over in the UK via his label Armalyte (http://www.armalyte.com/). Gilez has come a long way in the few years I've known him. Introduced to me by jared, Gilez put us on his Defcon 1 compilation and then brought the aggression over to the UK in 2001 for the release show. We've remained friends ever since . He's a helluva guy and a good family man. He works hard and it's good to see him being able to release an album of this calibre. It legitimizes him. Gilez and I spent a significant portion of the day yesterday trading secrets and ideas on how to eventually work together. We even laid out the terms of our deal. This could happen 10 years from now for all I know. It's not going to be Hypefactor, and probably not the aggression. But I know what Gilez wants for his label and it meshes with what I'm feeling like doing post-EXIT STRATEGIES. More on this, much later. MUCH.  Been struggling with the passing of a friend this holiday season, but I woke up this morning to a nice letter from a certain keyboardist in a band I have made no secret of adoring. It was a simple note expressing his appreciation for my support of said band. This started things with a smile, so kudos to the keyboardist in question. Made my day!  Off to LA on Monday. Not going to miss this horribly cold weather. Luckily for irene, she's coming out as well, so she can get away from this too. I'm hoping to have Chemlab copies next week, so I'll report in.  Bless  F               "
"             I've been wracking my brain, trying to figure out what my musical BEST OF is for 2003. I'm sorry Ash, but I think I was too busy making music in 03 to focus at the moment. However, i did walk out of 2003 loving stuff I was unfamiliar with like South, Telfon Tel Aviv, Death in Vegas, Andreas Tilliander, and others; unable to stop listening to stuff such as Chris Connelly, Acumen, Christ Analogue, Interpol, Cerati, ILC, and Saintface.  2003 saw the aggression go to Russia and come back just to 'split up' again, Ass Cobra was born, Hypefactor was reborn and yet the aggression is the only with a CD coming out anytime soon. Go figure, though 2004 is the 10th anniversary! However, you know who to thank at the cocktail party if that nothing happens to commemorate it.  I saw a career milestone reached as I got to be a part of the Chemlab relaunch, to which I would like to thank Jared, Jason and Jamie for letting me in on that. Hopefully, you will still love me on 27 January when the album comes out.  in 2004 these albums will hopefully own: Chemlab, Telfon Tel Aviv, NIN, Revenge 2cd retro, Ass Cobra, Oasis, and especially Saintface. Oh and maybe this Hypefactor album will come out!  Now for Film:  I wish I never returned to THE MATRIX, but Bryan Singer made X2 a near perfect comics book based movie. I also felt LAST SAMURAI was a huge awesome well of emotion, OLD SCHOOL will be seen as a classic for years to come, but no movie rocked my ass like LOST IN TRANSLATION. Bar none. The Best.  IN 2004, the movies to see will be CONSTANTINE, SPIDER-MAN 2 and HARRY POTTER.  In the world of Hong Kong film, Jackie Chan failed me with the MEDALLION though owned in SHANGHAI KNIGHTS. The INFERNAL AFFAIRS series is amazing, I have a gay thing for Takeshi Kaneshiro from THE RETURNER, and MEN SUDDENLY IN BLACK was one of the funniest films of the year. The loss of both Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui sucked majorly.  in 2004, my money is on NEW POLICE STORY and INFERNAL AFFAIRS 3.  In the world of comic books, nothing rocked harder than pretty much anything that came out of the apple computer owned by Mr. Geoff Johns. His FLASH issue 200 was THE best single issue of a comic book this year (even Wizard magazine agrees). He re-launched my all time favorite comic book TEEN TITANS to much acclaim and success. Honorable mention goes to Jeph Loeb who brought the HUSH storyline to an ok ending, but launched the awesome SUPERMAN/BATMAN series. However, my favorite non superhero book is NEGATION. I love it to death. This could make an awesome movie  I will run to the comic store to in 2004 to buy anything by Mr. Johns, Mr. Loeb (especially his upcoming run with Michael Turner on SUPERMAN/BATMAN), Brad Meltzer's DC Identity Crisis and KISS KISS BANG BANG.  Anyway, If I think of anything more, I'll let you know.  Back to the real world!  F         "
"             Back from LA at last. Seemed like I was gone for a month, but I've returned to a welcoming New York that finally has good weather (certainly better than LA, which rained like a mother the whole time). While I did enjoy some leisure time with the kick ass nephew, it was mostly all work, little play, and a few stolen moments to work on some music.   One of my goals in LA was to nail down the audio portion of MOG-X. This required a ton of effort and attention, but thanks to a certain engineer making my life incredibly easy, I made leaps and bounds with it. This has been a good time, a fun experience, with few cringe worthy moments. The truth will be revealed as to what this all means in May. However when in LA, my mouth got the better of me in certain circles just to gague a reaction to this kind of project. Needless to say it went over well.  My priority however was my HF2 vocals. This means driving around all day and night through LA while blasting the demos in the car. I sing along to the scratch vocals in order to get more comfortable with the material so when we go back to record the final vox, the delivery will be more confident. I find this method works best for me. Also, I refuse to do final vocals until we have the drums tracked, so Brandt made it a priority to send me demos that had both scratch vocals AND live drums tracked. The feel, the dynamic totally changes. Anyway, I feel good about the melodies and lyrics and think I can kick some vocal ass when it's time to do the final vox.  Speaking of live drums, the HF crew had a field day in my absence and had several drum sessions. It seems, and I'm sure that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, the practice sessions recorded on to tape were very helpful to Robin. I can tell you that though I havent been there for the recording of these drums, what is being sent back to me is nothing short of amazing. It seems Ash and Brandt have achieved a great drum sound and well, I don't have to get into how awesome a drummer my girl Robin is. We're almost there!  On my last day in LA, I spent an evening at the home studio of Leo V23 to go through the track he is working on for us, OUR FAITH. It was mostly dissecting the song and getting into mechanics of it, but I did give him Carte Blanche to get all Cerati on this track. I have a good feeling about this.  Meanwhile it seems now that everything is about catching up with the real world. Not a bad thing. The Oscars are tonight and it shocks me that MASTER AND COMMANDER is nominated. I just watched it and jesus was it boring as hell. Awesome acting, great action, but terrible storytelling. A major disappointment.   F  (the title above comes from the enjoyable French racing film Michel Valliant, which I caught in LA. Fun as hell)         "
"             Ok so no drums were actually recorded on sunday. Long story short: the mixer that tom supposedly fixed went on fire about 5 minutes after we set up. Tom Whitfleet, stick to guitars, pally. However, this gave us time to go over the drum parts with Robin. We taped it, so now she can study it and really get deep into it. She's mega. Anyway, I'm off to LA tomorrow so hopefully they will track this while I'm gone. I'm hoping.  The bad mood from that was lessed by an enjoyable WWE title win by Eddy Guerrero. The first thing that company has done right in ages. Now make it happen for Benoit.  Two things have made me laugh: 1. an 8 second mp3 of ash cursing, compiled by Matt Gentile. and 2. this: http://www.taleoftwocities.org/images/bushs_gallo.jpg  My man. I always know Barbra Bush was the hot one! Gallo-style!  F         "
"             Saw South on Friday night who were very enjoyable, enthusiastic and technically awesome. I think they rushed the gig as the sound was a little off, but they have the songs to back it up, so no biggie. South will do nothing in this country simply because they're songs are too intelligent and well-played. But as long as we know them in our own little corner of the world here, its all good. Brandt never showed for this gig because he was too busy working on the album. Now call me crazy, but i don't think thats ever happened in any of my musical projects before. So while he missed a gig, making him a dork, he is dead into the album, which makes him cool. So kudos,  you dork.  Yesterday I learned that Caviar (complete with imported blini) is the best Valentines present EVER. Bar none. Irene and I now also possess a new digital camera. Details as to why and how we own said camera cannot be disclosed at this time. Lou Reed would call this 'A Perfect Day'.  Things are about to get better as I prep my return to Robin's to continue Drum Tracking today.  The question tonight that Dan Hamill and I need answered is: Can Eddy do it?  F           "
"             I love women. I love my girl, I love my moms, I love the Ro Ro, but i LOVE LOVE LOVE my drummer. Went to the cage this weekend to check out some of the drums recorded thus far for HF2. DAMN! It's awesome. She's a monster skin beatin' babe. The 4 songs she's done so far have gone to a whole new level. And this was just the warm up. More this weekend. I'm dead psyched. Thanks to this woman, this album's getting some balls.  Brandt did some more tracking on OUR FAITH, which is a rocky tune, described to me as Cerati meets Oasis. It rocks. Now, the parts will go to Leo V23 in LA for his contributions. The intention is to meet with him a few times while I am in LA to work with him on the track and to find out what is up with the V23 best of.  Work on MOG-X has finally begun in earnest this week. I'm having fun with this. I've brought in a handsome and knowledgeable young man to help me with some of the visual aspects of this project. I'm working on the audio portion of this project to get it set in motion before I leave for LA next week.  I am not a reality TV guy, but goddammit I do love THE APPRENTICE. YOURE FIRED.  F         "

"             Just when I think I'm too jaded and that I've seen or heard everything this planet has to offer me, i read this and I become that 17 year old at the Marquee again:  From the New Order website, worldinmotion.net  'Good morning Peter, what is going on Hooky's world today?  PH: Spending lot of time recording New Order new album and at the same time writing songs for my new side project with Mani and Andy Rourke. The name is 'FREEBASS' or 'STALINGRAD' but still not final.'  Besides Episode 3 and a new Batman movie, I now have a new reason to live ;-)  F           "
"             Reeling from the Indy debacle (and I know quite a bit about it what the hell went down with that), Irene and I cabbed it to her fave hipster hang, Piano's to check out some Saintface. They went on extremely late (shades of the aggression's first 'headlining' show at Batcave so many years ago), but we had fun hanging out with the lads and having a few pints. I was excited to hear the DJ play some Colder (who right now is the one album everyone in the MOGcamp can agree on). Around 1ish (I think) the 'Face took to the stage and made it all worth the wait. I don't know how much more I can write about my favourite band. It's all been said. During this gig, Peter revealed the album title (don't think I didn't catch that, pally), and they played a new song, the title I don't recall, but another worthy track. Peter is intentionally fucking with me to make the album tracklist a surprise, but I did figure out how it ENDS. You'll see. Irene,  upset she had missed the last show, was dead into the gig and my highlight (lo-light) was Brandt getting his ass verbally kicked by Peter by not clapping to HUDSON AND DAY. What a douche. Brandt, that is. Anyhow, another fun evening topped off by 2am cheese fries with my girl at the Gramercy. Luckily, no sign of Ryan and Parker.  Back in the real world, we made it through cold and rain to the old aggression bunker and current Ass Cobra space (aka Robin's basement) for the latest attempt at recording drums for the Hypefactor album. I won't bore you with specifics, but technical difficulties made for a half frustrating/half productive evening. However, cameos from both Ash and Matt at separate intervals helped ease the pain. Somewhere during all this I learned of a potential REAL band name for Ass Cobra, which Ash created and I think is excellent. Which is why other cobra's will probably kill this. Ash also spun some of his new Carbon Framework material, which I'm totally digging hard. This kid is on fire. Matt Gentile and I discussed the Sisters of Mercy yet again, which for some reason makes me insanely angry that the last time they put a new album out I was still in my teens.  Eventually, we got some drums down for MORNING AFTER and EXIST. I'm dead happy working with Robin, who is a great team player. She really pushes herself and you never get less than 150% from this spatula weilding skin beater. Lucky to have her. Anyway, we still have a lot of drums to do, but I think we've got the set up down and are getting more effective by the day. At this point we have drums down for 4 tracks. I think Brandt will now edit these down and then eventually we will do re-takes so its cleaner and smoother. But finally, a bit of momentum at last. Oh and more buscuits at KFC at 1am!  Also occupying my time is MOG-X. All I can say.  F         "
"             What a shity way to start the day. My dream Summer Trio of films for 2005 (indy, Batman, and Star Wars) is now shot to hell:  'Variety reports that the reunion of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones 4 is on hold again as a new script draft is commissioned. Paramount had hoped to get into production on a fourth film in 2004 for a 2005 release. Frank Darabont had been brought in to script a concept the trio liked, but apparently Lucas wasn't happy with the draft. They will now bring aboard another screenwriter to rewrite Darabont's script.  The trade added that Spielberg had no comment on his plans. Spielberg, Lucas and Ford have been trying for nearly a decade to mount one last Indiana Jones adventure, on the condition that all three had to love the concept and script before proceeding.  Finding an availability window for Spielberg, Ford and Lucas is daunting, and it is now looking like a 2005 production start at the earliest'   RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  F         "
"             The elements had to smack somebody sometime, so thanks to a fever of 103, Brandt had to bow out of Saturday's drum recording, which effectively killed that. Learning of this only 10 minutes before I was leaving for the session, I was left with a blank day. Now normally I would be a happy lad about a day of hooky, but when one is focused on the initial plan and its killed at the last minute, cranky F comes to the forefront.  However, I got caught up on some reading (new issue of Tape Op, thanks to Irene for that subscription, and Kris Needs' new Primal Scream bio, which is excellent), and wandered about a bit. I stumbled across the new Industrial Nation. Now honestly, I dont like anything industrial any more and I dont think one feature (or the musicians) in the magazine remotely interest me (Give me Al over Ronan any day), I was happy to find both of my bands were reviewed quite favorably. I'm sure these reviews will be quoted quite freely on the respective band sites. This helped the mood somewhat, as did the back cover Underground Inc ad that had Chemlab on it.  Also, arriving on my door that day was the debut album from the french band COLDER, who Irene suggested to me after reading that they were compared to a pop Joy Division and Suicide. Well, that merited a looksee. I'm happy to report the album, AGAIN, is very enjoyable. It's not so much songs as it is moods. The man behind colder is a French-Asian dude who is also a multimedia artist, and Colder is both a film and music project. The package I got had a CD with music and then the accompanying DVD of short films to go with the music. I think the only reason it's musically compared to Joy Divsion is that some of the drum programming is very Stephen Morris like. Plus the artwork is very JD. Cool stuff.  With Irene out running yesterday morning, I popped in my long-awaited copy of the Thai movie ONG BAK, which has been making waves in the Martial Arts Movie circles for some time for it's frighteningly real use of Thai boxing moves in a Martial Arts Movie setting. The star, who is also the co-writer of the film, Phanom Yeerum had been described to me as someone who could fight like Bruce Lee and fly like Jackie Chan. Now, you know I don't accept shit like that lightly, so I went out of my way to check this movie out. Needless to say, the movie itself is totally underwhelming and cliche, but the fighting is the scariest I have ever seen on film. Ever. Thai boxing is an exceptionally brutal sport and this film captures that brutality in a way that makes you scream with delight while also cringing for the life of Phanom Yeerum as well as his poor stuntmen. It was scary good. The DVD bonus of watching them put these fights together is even scarier and better than the fights in the movie!! And yes he can flip and fly like Jackie and fight like Bruce, though he lacks the charisma of both. However, this dude is probably in a shit mood after being kicked in the head so many times. He's basically the ECW version of Kung Fu.  To me, the key will be to bring Phanom Yeerum to Hong Kong and put in a movie where an experience director and fight chroegographer can maximize that potential in a well made movie.If that happens and it works, the new era of fight cinema starts with this guy.  F           "
"             So, Irene and I made the trek to a midtown Manhattan movie theatre to see a special preview of HELLBOY, the large motion picture based on the Dark Horse Comic. Believe this or not kids, I have never one in my life read a copy of this comic. Therefore, I was going into it fresh, with nothing to compare it to. Needless to say, I was impressed, especially with the first half of the movie. The set-up is great and the actors are super, especially Ron Pearlman as the title character. To be able to create a sympathetic and likeable character with all the make-up and gear on really blew me away. I love the character, I love the set up, and it’s obvious that the director loves this comic more than anyone. It’s exceptionally well-directed and the FX are top notch. However, the third act seems rather anti-climatic, similar to how I felt about SPIDERMAN, but I like these characters and are invested in them and want them to win at the end. That takes a lot these days, but it just needed that one kick ass moment at the end to put it over for me. So, in retrospect, HELLBOY gets a big thumbs up and I hope to follow more of his adventures.  CLONE WARS Season Two and while I loved it, especially since it’s starting to lead to the schism between Obi-Wan and Anakin, I loved it even more watching the first 10 episodes in a row with 5 Year Old Cousin who could be my Clone. This led to much playtime and web searching for Birthday presents for him. I think he will be quite happy with his Republic Gunship.  Thanks to one of the web savvy rivet kids (this time, its Aero), I just heard 5 tracks off of the new Skinny Puppy album THE GREATER WRONG OF THE RIGHT. Well, I’m happy to report it’s really super stuff. It takes the best of it’s two main principals, Ogre and Key and plays to each of their incredible strengths. The production is incredible and Ogre’s vocals are amazing. It’s actually similar to his solo material. When he works with Mark Walk, he’s usually either very straightforward in his delivery or Walk goes Pro Tools crazy on him. This works on the solo stuff, but no one knows how to get the best out of Ogre than Cevin Key. While I feel there are elements and sounds that go back to the old Puppy days, I feel this is very contemporary. It reminds me of RABIES era done in a modern style with better programming. It’s a big step forward from THE PROCESS, which remains one of the most underrated albums ever released. Yes this has guitars, but not in the way THE PROCESS had them. A great comeback and I’ve only heard 5 songs!  If Watts, Ministry, NIN and Die Warzau can live up to the Puppy album, The I-Rock old guard is gonna clean house this year. Now where are the kids!? Who’s next! Come on.  F          "
"             While I don't have anything specific to report, I will just jot down my thoughts today:  1. Running into Joe Saintface yesterday on the subway was an enjoyable experience. Two bassists in mid album on the N train train complaining about their bandmates is the best way to ride down to Union Square.  2. Jackie Can V Donnie Yen Part II. Jackie and Donnie will have their second on-screen throw down in the TWINS EFFECT 2, the sequel to last year's surprisingly fun movie popcorn movie starring HK chick pop duo Twins. Jackie V Donnie Part I was in the extremely awesome SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, but the fight was too short (something I have told the director repeatedly) and I was left wanting more. Hopefully this will deliver. Jackie Chan's SON, in his 20's, is the male lead of this movie which scares me and makes me feel incredibly old. It was almost 20 years ago when I was doing a Jackie Chan fanzine speculating that he might have a wife and child. Sure enough, I was right!  3. Skinny Puppy's new album is released in May. I am cautiously optimistic. I feel deep inside that it will be awesome, but I feel it will not be for the diehards. Good I say. Bands need to move forward. These are not the same men we knew 10 years ago. However, they are no less talented than what they were. However, including the douche with the bad hair from Static X on a track is the first red flag. I hope I'm far away from Ash when this album comes out.  4. Meanwhile, Eric Powell has caused the industrial version of 9/11 with a vicious email to a rivet fan who is not so happy with Eric's direction with his new band, Ringer. Granted, he was provoked by this kid. The intial Email wasn't exactly Roger Ebert quality in terms of it being a well-constructed commentary, but to respond like that wasn't the coolest thing to do either. I understand Eric's need to branch out musically, I personally don't like the new music at all, but what i dont understand why Eric, according to his E-mail, walked away from so many record and management deals? Everyone's circumstance's are different, granted, and it's certainly not my place to speculate. Eric's put out some great music, but I think cooler heads should have previaled. Eric's frightening dismissal of the 16 Volt legacy post-WISDOM is more shocking and disappointing to me than any of this.   5. Meanwhile, on a better note, I heard some demos by a well established I-rock band who many love and have been hoping for a 'return to form' from for many years. What I have heard thus far ranks in the 'so far so good' in terms of harkening back to an older style that they made famous. It will certainly be the best thing they have done in ages and one new song in particular might be one of their best ever. Stay tuned. Thanks to you know who for hooking me up with that.  6. This I just read on Cracknation.com and it pisses me off to high heaven. It's regarding the second album from one of my favorite new bands, Defragmentation (who recently did an awesome remix for us): 'Well...unfortunately...Martin has decided to sideline this release until more copies of Self Construct are sold.  Which means, this album may never get released, unless a resurgence in popularity of their 1st disc occurs (considering the zero promotion that it was given...well, I'm not expecting it).  Jeff's contractually bound to Underground Inc as well, so this really fuckin blows...he's pretty much stuck. ' To say this angers me is an understatement. It's a bullshit excuse from a label that needs to be developing young talent and supporting established acts (READ: CHEMLAB, ACUMEN) that can actually make money for the label if they had the proper resources. I could write a book on this, just based on the past year of OXIDIZER, which has taken a large toll on me professionally and personally. Bullshit. You wonder why the 'scene' is dead. Dumb.  7. Rumours abound that the new Episode of Star Wars will either be called 'RISE OF THE EMPIRE' or 'THE CREEPING FEAR'. Gee, which one of THOSE suck?  8. In other Star Wars news, season 2 of CLONE WARS starts tomorrow. Bring it!  9. My dentist cleaned my teeth the other day with COOKIE DOUGH flavoured cleaning stuff. He also has full INTERNET and CABLE while you are actually IN THE CHAIR. He is also worried about my manager/agent/advisor and thinks she is 'all over the place'. She's been his patient for years and he just figures this out now? Also, he has robbed Dan Hamill of thousands of dollars. So thanks to Dan Hamill, I can blog while getting my teeth done. This to me is the greatest.  10. I'm REALLY glad i didn't go to Wolfsheim.  Bonus Musing: I wish Matt Gentile posted more.  I'll tell you about HELLBOY tomorrow.  F           "
"             so there we were, the douche, the superstar and the recently legalized girlfriend, at Citizenfest '04.  after seeing way too many people on line outside and in the club that were totally not on my list of must-sees in the remainder of my lifetime, the show began.  actually, after seeing people i'd prefer to never see again on line outside, followed by an anal intrusion by webster hall 'security', and then seeing more people i'd prefer to never see again once inside, we waited...and then the show began.  i guess it was close to 11p when the two german boys and their computer, collectively known as wolfsheim (that's pronounced VOLFS-hime for those who don't understand that the german language does not allow for a *sh* sound), took to the stage.  the show was a good mix of new songs (which i don't own) and fan/club-floor faves.  some history - the douche and i flew to germany for DOOMSDAY in august 2000 to see these guys in dresden (yes, there was a skinny puppy reunion at the festival, but we were already investigating the trip before we found out that fact).  this was back in the day when he and i would take over any venue that was lucky enough to have us show up.  and dresden, berlin and munich were no exceptions to that fate.  was i impressed by their first performance in nyc ever?  no.  was i entertained?  sure.  thoroughly.  the boys got smart in the past few years because they took a page out of de/vision's book by adding a live guitarist and drummer to the tour.  oh...did i say de/vision, i meant depeche mode (but i actually hate dm mit drums...definitely prefer dm sans drums - i can argue this with frank til i'm blue in the face).  they used the new live act primarily on the new stuff but added it, appropriately i feel, to some of the older tracks that really rocked out with the live feel of real drums.  case in point was 'heroin, she said'.  if you know the track, you know the chorus has a great breakbeat type drumline - normally lost when using synth-drums, but powerful with an actual person behind a kit.  other highlights, for me, included 'lovesong' (not a cure cover), 'sparrows...' and 'real'.  the point in the show which made me want to walk out was, of course, the final song of the evening...the last song of the second encore...a song which apparently 'gives them touble in germany' - 'once in a lifetime'.  i used to pop for this song like it was martin l. gore singing an acoustic 'dressed in black' at jones beach.  but watching the citizens on parade as they recall the song from their like-new copy of metropolis' release of spectators (four years after the album came out, fyi)...i was almost disappointed.  it was an obvious closer...but still left me with an awkward, uncomfortable feeling - very similar to the once i received walking into the venue by a mark phingers-esque looking cro-magnon bouncer.  indeed.  all in all - a fun evening.  i learned a few things that night.  i learned that citizens can find true love, if you look for it in a basement in franklin square, li.  i learned that a good talking to could instill the fear of god in someone.  and most importantly, i learned that i never want to attend another citizenfest again.         "
"             Well, I'm still coming down from the Wrestlemania experience. First, hats off to Matt Gentile, who, despite trying to swerve me into thinking he had accidentally burned one of the tickets, really came through big time by getting us 4 excellent seats at MSG. All for, as Dan Hamill would say GRATIS (though he would say it GRATIAS). The show itself was a blast, the crowd was fun and we saw some super wrestling. In particular, Chris Benoit pulled off the big one and  really made the evening special with his big win. Also, in the surreal part of the night, Brock Lesnar, the Next Big Dumbass, was booed out of the building. How stupid is this guy to walk away from the sport that made him tons of money and a star to boot? He's young and will regret this decision. Instead of being the next Kurt Angle, he's for now, the next Ultimate Warrior. He'll be back. Watch.  Anyhow, before all this Mania, I spent my Saturday in a German bar drinking with G and Matt, and later Ash. Also, we ate potato pancakes and 'cupcakes'. This was a good time, nay, a great time. It reminded me of our days abroad. However, the drinks took their toll and after a wine filled dinner with Irene, I found myself drunkenly harrassing tourists in Times Square. Man, that was embarassing, but Irene got a kick out of it and thats enough for me. Then we hit Broadway and saw AVENUE Q, which is amazing and hilarious. SEE THAT. Broadway is in an excellent phase right now with plays like WICKED and AVENUE Q that are very commerical, yet artistic, clever and entertaining. I hate musicals, but I love those.  I have to tease you with some info. A certain pal of mine, known in many circles musically, has reported via a mate that he has contributed to a certain album that will kick major ass this year. I didnt even know these guys were DOING an album. The I-kids are going to be pleased as punch.  F         "
"             Last night the Factor Corp. gathered for the first time in ages for the next round of drum tracking for HF2. It was a well-coordinated operation. Ash, who has a car, would bring the gear, Brandt would set it up, Robin would play the drums and me, well I get to hang out with my mates and have Ash drive me to Wendy's. I don't do much, though I did read a great interview with John Taylor in THE FACE. Ash and I discussed wrestling on the way to Wendy's. Brandt has the drum set up down to a science so the set up time is now under an hour. Impressive to say the least. I know it sounds like I do little, but mostly my job is to comment if something ISN'T going right or if I don't like swhat's going on. Happily, I've had to pull very few of what I call 'Executive Decisions' on this album, which to me only reminds me that my true skill is finding the right collaborators to make music with. I don't miss the aggression on days like this! ;-)  We had an agenda of 4 songs: OUR FAITH, THE THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, LENINGRAD (formerly known as Two Bass), and THEME FROM PROPAGANDA. Ash claimed we'd get 1 done, I said 2 at best. Lo and behold a certain drummer did her homework and hit a grand slam and knocked all 4 out of the park. Big time. B reported to me this morning that she was dead on most of the time and very little editing will be required. I love this woman. She just makes my life so much easier.   So now the next steps are as follows: B goes to Chicago for a week and immerses himself in edits, which he will be sending me as he progresses. In the meantime, I continue working on melodies, singing along to the demos, etc to get into shape. Hopefully, when B returns I'll be ready to sing and sing like a mother. However, I'm going to take my time with this and not rush it.   Meanwhile, following up my previous entry, Matt Gentile has TRULY earned his Superstar nickname and has obtained 4 tickets for Wrestlemania at Madison Square Garden this Sunday. How he pulled this off was pure genius and totally legal to boot, so to say I'm impressed is an understatement. Dan Hamill has not been this excited since Bon Jovi released NEW JERSEY. I think we will be attending Wrestlemania in suits. 4 Classholes out on the town!  F          "
"             Sorry it has been some time since I posted last, but an attempted graduation and HF2 have swamped me for the past few months. Consider this a bid to be a bit more disciplined, as there will be a lot to say in the next few months, and not all of it about factor.  Speaking of...  Yesterday Robinowitz, F and I spent the evening on Long Island (out of necessity, not choice) for what will be our second-to-last session of live drum recording. Ash dropped off the gear, made a run to Wendy's and trashed some '80s music before taking his leave, although we begged him to stay. After a whirlwind setup, we tackled four tunes: 'The Morning After The Life Before,' 'Our Faith,' 'Theme From Propaganda' and 'Leningrad' (formerly known as 'Two Basses,' and there's a free drink at KGB in it for anyone who can figure out the origin of the new title.)  F wrote extensively here about the devolution of our earliest drum sessions into logistical nightmares, the worst of which was the electrical blaze that temporarily retired Ash's mixing desk. Honestly, the first five or six sessions were total pains in the ass, between moving gear out to Long Island, moving  ourselves  out to Long Island, scheduling idiocy, incompetent parts suppliers and missing gear.   But yesterday's session (and the two previous - one with Ash and Robin and one with Robin alone) was, in a word, effortless. For the first time, we made it through the full schedule of songs for the evening (with time to spare for homemade biscuits.) Robin's playing was spot-on; I spent this morning at the Cage listening to her playing without any EQ or compression, and it was striking to hear how few edits would be required on the tracks. 'Theme From Propaganda' is now a storming funk tune - house music played by a live band (which just might be disco, right?) - while 'Leningrad' is Gustavo Cerati's Ocio project playing folk music. Nice stuff.  'Creation Phase' is undergoing a major overhaul at the moment thanks to prodding from Robin and Ash, although it probably will not be complete until well into April. During a tracking session for this tune and 'Solar' in mid-February, we ran into problems with a rhythm arrangement for the bridge, and Robin and Ash basically said the song's second half was shit. I do not always agree with Ash, but he was dead-on right; I'd had reservations about the bridge for some time myself, and they validated that. The next week Robin and I tracked a drum part for the 'new' bridge that, when complete, will mark the first time this band has written around the drummer, rather than loops. When this tune emerges from maintenance, expect it to be leaner and meaner. The meanest song on the LP, in fact, when F's vocals are complete.  A slew of gigs are coming up that I am hoping will be brilliant: Death Cab For Cutie at Irving Plaza, Squarepusher at Irving and The Rapture and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in a double headlining bill at Roseland. And, were that not exciting enough, The Twilight Singers return for a Warsaw gig at the beginning of April. More on that later.  I know this is a few weeks late, but... Danny: I'm sorry about Scarlett. Benicio's a douché.         "
"             Oh Darling, you know I've not forgotten you. It's just that while I live a fun life, there's only so much you can write about without boring the reader. I mean, how much can write about my excitement about Groovie Mann joining RevCo? I sincerely doubt you'll want to hear me discuss my views on Wrestlemania (though if Matt Gentile gets us into the show, he will truly be a MOGsuperstar). I doubt you want to hear about the large amounts of sushi Irene and I downed tonight.  Anyway, things are moving along here. I saw alleged members of the MOGpac at Ash's Birthday gathering the other night and this was a partial treat. It was good to catch up with the RJ's of the world (RJ is my bizarro twin in the life of Ash who happens to be an excellent musician and Ash's writing partner in the world of electronic music), and it was good to see Ash in good spirits. It was also a good opportunity to thank Ass Cobra bassist Charles from saving those bitches from a life of aggression covers (this is a JOKE). However, the absence of both Matt Gentile and the Kidd was felt, though, as the MOGpac lacked its heart and soul, respectively.  Meanwhile, we enjoyed STARSKY AND HUTCH for its homoeroticism (had to see it with G) and hated JERSEY GIRL for its hetroness. Affleck is just flat out lame and Kevin Smith disppoints as a director as he ages, though I am excited he is writing and directing THE GREEN HORNET.   I think I've seen Saintface a few times since we've last spoke. Again, full on. They take the stage on Long Island for the first time this Friday. I fear for them as I have been on many a Long Island stage and rarely has it been enjoyable. Anyway. Saintface. Impressive, ok but where's the album. Well, my gossip is as follows. It's just been reported to me that a certain lead singer from said band just walked out of The Birdcage with a keyboard belonging to certain lead singer who is typing this. Something about 'strings' and then 'mixing'. Stay tuned.  I work daily on my vocals for HF2. It is a slow process, more based around developing the feel for each track. I sing along quite a bit. Thursday there will be more drum recording. This excites me as we are so close. I can't wait to get this album back into the studio where I can get into a routine.  In the world of I-Music, i discuss further work with Jared though nothing set in stone at the moment. I have to send some loops in for his project with Spyby. Hope they like what we did. LeoV23 writes to inform me that progress is being made on the V23 retro CD. there might possibly be a new song that they will finish for this release. I have begged to remix. My agent/manger says I have become the industrial Ryko-disc guy.  In the meantime, I remain happily domestic. I watch wrestling and Teen Titans, I play RISE TO HONOUR, which is making me mental, and I occasionally buy my girlfriend things for our kitchen. I find myself listening to Chris Connelly's new project EVERYONED and enjoying it immensely. I am looking forward to reuniting with the MOGpac spinoff group Team Obscene to watch Mania this weekend and I am dead psyched about Irene and I seeing Avenue Q on Broadway this weekend.  And then there's the cinematic side of my life, which I can never speak of, though many of you would love to hear. I did get a CONSTANTINE crew jacket, which is nice as hell. 8 years of script notes and all I got was this jacket (and a possible cameo in the movie). Anyhow.   I will report back to you soon about more drums, my new cel phone, and other assorted goodies.  F           "
"             This warm and sunny morning started off with a chance run in on the corner of 17th and Park Avenue with the wonderful Robin, who as I learned in this brief time spent with her, is quite 'busy and jangly'. Where I'm from, these are good things, but obviously not in certain dim places. I always enjoy my time with my multi-talented bandmate and friend. If I can take one thing from this conversation, which included everything from comparing ipods to discussing school and New Jersey, it is that I wish the aggression a long eternal slumber in the annals (not anals, Dan Hamill), of history. See my previous post regarding 'missing being in a band'. I'd rather go back to High School, or maybe early college cause there were girls then. Anyhow, in the words of Greg Dulli, actually some French chick he recorded...goodbye motherfucker.  Onward, Ho's.  Then next time I checked email, I received this epic from a fan, who after much praise for the Chemlab album, writes:  'Alright, this was not the original intention to write this message to you, it was because of the Hype Factor EP which is just not leaving the 'right-next-to-the-stereo-pile', I'm not even thinking about putting it on the '2nd-next-pile', no f'n way. I'm still caught in the beauty of it. I have told you before, it's true and by the time you might have gotten tired of people telling you such BUT, F.J, it is such a won-der-ful record, simple as that. Also, I recently discovered I never saw the beauty lying in your voice before this effort? I've tried a dozen times to write this sentence without it sounding so damn gay but I failed, can you xqs me? I maybe miss the appropriate words (no native speaker here, sorry) but damn it's such an honest effort, I can onnly presume this was the most personal piece of music / lyrical work you've ever done? By the way, 'thieves' (which I'm sure isn't only my favourite on 'the distracted lover') made it right into my all-time-favourite-achy-breaky-sour&sweet-luv-tunes-ever'. What an amazing, amazing song. Thank you so much, F.J., I msut be getting repetitive, excuse me, but you know, I kinda had to let you know. Again.'  Well, if I know the new album will sell ONE copy, here's the dude that will buy it. This letter makes everything we do worth it! And no I haven't grown tired of people telling me that they love DISTRACTED, the problem is, the only person who tells me that is Brandt! ;-)  This could be a good day.  F         "
"             My Significant Other, a fine woman, ventured via Chinatown bus (the in thing to do, and extremely cheap) to DC to check out Neubauten. She and her friend Lauren have a Neubauten tradition where they get drunk and check out a few of their gigs. Personally, having seen them perform once before many of you were in nursery school, I think getting drunk and watching them is some form of torture. Not to say I don't appreciate them. As Dan Hamill put it: 'It doesnt matter what the tradition is, its just good to have tradition' I, being someone who has never seen Greg Dulli perform while being sober because of 'tradition' (with the exception of that one Pigface related incident which you can read here somewhere) cannot argue, especially in light of my recent actions in Brooklyn (see previous entry re: Twilight Singers at Warsaw).  Anyhow this was the first time Irene has gone out of town since she moved in. It's usually me leaving for LA and her staying here, but it was shocking to see how quickly I regressed to being a 15 year old again. When I wasn't working, I was either buying or watching Kung-Fu movies, playing videogames, reading comics, surfing the web (more ebay shit), eating unhealthy, and playing music at indecently loud levels. This was all done in the company of either Evan, G or both.  Though I have to admit, it was fun watching the directors cut of WRATH OF KHAN and reciting the dialogue for G and Ev during the entire movie. However, I missed being an adult!  Ok so then, mostly out of obligation to my non music profession, Evan and I went to check out THE PUNISHER late Friday night. I don't know what I did to piss off God, but making it throught his movie earns me the right to change my second initial to Jesus. Everyone involved with this movie should be shot, especially Travolta (who should fire EVERYONE who works for him NOW for letting him do this piece of crap). Poor Thomas Jane. He's a nice man who was right for the role but was saddled with a script that was seemingly re-written to be as shitty as possible.  Someday, THE PUNISHER will be taught in a classroom (probably by me) about how NOT to make a comic book based movie. Utter shit.  We were saved somewhat the next day when me and my two pals went to check out KILL BILL VOL.2. I don't think it's any secret that I am not a big fan of the first volume. I thought it was predictable, not too clever, and the action was so-so. Overcritical? Yes, of course, as its QT going onto my turf of Asian Cinema. Anyhow, Volume 2 is a very enjoyable film that is tight and fun, character driven and filled with great action. IN particular, the throwdown between Uma (looking better than ever) and Darryl Hannah (looking scary as fuck) was excellent. Also, Vol 2 made perfect use of Gordon Lui and Michael Madsen, which is what I really needed from this movie.  OK, QT, now save Travolta again and go make the Vega Brothers!   Meanwhile, my Ebaying has gone totally overboard. I have won a dozen Jackie Chan photobooks and two stunt crew tshirts. It's very weird that this has all kicked in, though I think it has to do with the fact that JC has just turned 50. FIFTY! I remember being a kid and him approaching 30 and thinking that he was only going to make 3 more movies or something. JC, despite that my girlfriend has to wake up every day and stare at a wall of JC pix and posters, is still the man!  F         "
"             Again, it what seems like a decade, the main Factor principles of Brandt, Ash, Robin and myself gathered for the first official HF photo session. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this band in its short lifespan has yet to have an official photo. Everything you have seen so far, including the pix in the DISTRACTED sleeve come from other sources (ie. videos or candid shots). Sadly, despite my begging and pleading, Peter Saintface bowed out; most likely to prep rough mixes for me to hear (HINT). Meanwhile, Brandt enlisted his friend Kathie-Rose (forgive me if I've spelled your name wrong) to take said shots. Thank God this nice girl has the patience of a saint to deal with us.  A few days earlier while planning this, Ash had a smart idea to put us to work in the studio as we are all rarely in the same room at the same time. Based on that, Brandt, as usual, smartly did the homework and had everything ready and waiting for us. This evening would also give Robin the opportunity to hear some of her drum work for the first time ('wait, I played on that?'), and for Ash to review his basslines from 2 weeks ago that we all love ('eh, I'm not feeling it').   Though we all agreed on our love for the new bridge in CREATION PHASE and Brandt, in one his 'Ideas that F.J. thinks is stupid when he first hears it but is later proven wrong' told us we would have to write a new outro to the song in a different key because that new bridge ended in a different key. I, of course, was like 'that's stupid', but thats what I always say. However, then we got it going. As usual, the mandate of pushing these songs forward is proven to be successful as the new outro is awesome and allowed me to get some cool 'F.J. bass' in there. The song BLOWS up at the end. I'm loving it.  For every great moment like that, there's some frustration. On another song, SOLAR, we decided to have Robin re-track her chorus basslines against her new drums. This proved tough. What she originally had was a very simple line that I felt drove the song perfectly, but Ash felt there could be more to it in a 'dub' sorta way. After Robin's many attempts, Ash took over for awhile, but he couldn't quite crack it either. I think we all liked where he was going, but it just wasn't getting there. Honestly, I think we should go back to the simplicity of the original bassline, but we have to at least explore every angle before committing. We owe these songs, and each other, that much.  During all this, Kathie-Rose, took what seemed like a million photos. She's very sweet, very cool, but I think was upset to learn that Ash, Robin, and I all hate The Pixies. What was interesting was that after 10 years on and off working together, Ash and I didn't realize that we both hated them. I was convinced he loved them and he thought I loved them. EH! BOTH WRONG. This was a big bonding moment, for Ash, Robin and I. We spent a good half hour RAILING on The Pixies. Enjoy the reunion, Brandt!  Anyway, the evening ended late with Kathie-Rose taking more 'band' shots. I think she coulda kept going all night taking pix, but my crew was getting cranky so we called it a night. FULL SUCCESS.  During this, I realized the only thing I miss about the aggression was the comraderie of being in 'the band' with my friends. However, after hearing tales about certain mates other bands and the drama and high school kiddie shit that goes on within their unit, I was suddently quite happy to just have a 'project' that is evolving into a band that will only have people who WANT to make the best possibly music they can.   Music should be the escape FROM the drama of the everyday, right?  In other news, I have regressed to my 15 year old self once again and I'm suddenly buying rare Jackie Chan movie programmes from Japan. These highly collectable books were my teenage obsession, but my collection was far from complete. On a whim, and encouraged by my significant other, I went on Ebay only to find that two places in Japan have unloaded TONS of them. So far I have yet to lose an auction, but I doubt the rent will be on time, especially now that I've found someone selling Jackie Chan stuntcrew Tshirts (I have the ORIGINAL from the early 80's!). I'm in trouble to say the least.  In news beyond everything, in a rare NYC appearance the other night, Bradley J. Fox, fresh from his travels to Paris, Capetown and Bucharest, announced that he and his Wife Dee Dee are expecting their first small Cramp. I feel this child will kick much ass and now I must concede my LA digs to this small baby. My request for bunk beds for the forthcoming infant and I was denied. Luckily, Agent/Manager/Lawyer has an extra bedroom just for me. Irene and I are inching closer to bi-costalness, i think...should know more this summer.  F             "
"             The weather suddenly gets good and things get going here! First off, my laptop is back and to make a long story short, when upgrading to OSX, something went wrong and I wiped out EVERYTHING I have ever done in this laptop. Let's not use words like 'backed up' or 'saved', ok? Needless to say, thanks to the geniuses at DRIVESAVERS, I have all my erased files and I am significantlly lighter in the wallet. However, now my computer is running super amazing out of control awesome. Though I have no music software at the moment.  However, we have some amazing stuff brewing for this new album. Ash's bass playing is incredible on MORNING AFTER and the bridge we wrote for CREATION PHASE was looped over and over again when I spent my Saturday at the studio.  Before all this, Mr. G, Brandt, and I checked out the face in Brooklyn, just a block away from where my mom grew up. This venue, Southpaw, is the bestfor Saintface.They thrive there. Memo to the guitar player: Dont punch your guitar after the first song unless you have a backup guitar, pally. Just sayin.  Morrissey has often failed me in his solo life. I have yet to enjoy myself at any of his solo gigs that I have been to. His last album was utter shit. Saintface, who I have described as 'what Morrissey wishes his solo career was' has my heart in recent years when it comes to music. However, he is always forgiven. I will buy his new album and already spent way too much money on tickets for his gig next month. I have to admit, I'm enjoying the Morrissey comeback. We live in an age where we DO need someone like Morrissey to be, ahem, our frank role model. Reading his intelligent and witty criticisms of our world in the NME this weekend made me smile. However, the SPIN article was terrible. Not because of him, but because SPIN is the worst music magazine pretending to be cool I have ever read. Put Peter Saintface on the cover and maybe I'll by it again.  I think the first photo session for HF2 is this week. Maybe Thursday. I'll keep you posted.  F           "
"             Things post-laptop problems are starting to get back to normal a little bit. I still don't have my laptop back, but the initial shock of what I did to it (another time) has worn off. Again, I credit Irene for keeping me sane. However, my IPOD took a dive on Friday, which now makes me feel quite jinxed. This led to some time back at Apple in Soho, but the situation was saved by 'the IPod genius'. Also, thanks to Brandt, I was able to get 1500 or so songs, including some very rare ones BACK into my Ipod within a few hours. A minor crisis saved. Frustrated, Irene and I spoiled ourselves with an evening at Jules, a wonderful French place on St. Marks.  Post dinner, we spent some brief face to face time with Peter Saintface, who was in good spirits and certainly enjoyable to chat with. He now has his songs for this album and I expect we're going to get some greatness out of him!  The next morning, I was feeling refreshed, so I ran to the studio early  to work on more bass and surprisingly, Ash was only an hour and a half late. He had issues with the basslines in MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. His belief was that while what I played in the song worked for it, it was more of my typical 'hook style' bass playing than it was rythmic. Repeated listenings to the song confirmed this to me. Instead of me doing it myself, I suggested Ash record it as he was the one who pointed it out and obviously had been thinking about it. Also, my other motive, no pun intended, was to get him more invested in the song from the bass side, as he will be the live bassist.  Needless to say, it was interesting to watch him work. I've only jammed with him on songs as opposed to putting him in front of me, as a producer, and having him work out a part. Instead of full sections, he worked the chorus out a few measures at a time; eventually writing one longer piece. It's very mathmatical, very detailed, very technical and very successful. It was totally fascinating. I've worked with the guy for years and he still comes up with new ways to puzzle me. After I left, I believe the two of the laid down the rest of that song.   Then, Ash, Brandt and I reworked the bridge to CREATION PHASE, a section that had been troubling everyone in the group, except me of course. Brandt had a vision for this and even tracked Robin playing some random drums based on what he had heard in his head. When I heard the drums earlier in the week, I dismissed it as being too MARCH OF THE PIGS, but when he edited them into the song and presented a guitar part, it was very obvious that this was more akin to The Who. And this is NOT a bad thing. Ash played bass and I played   a quick Hook-style lead over this bridge and we hammered it out in what seemed like 3 minutes. It's awesome. I dream of it. I'm happy. In my old age, I've gotten good at letting my collaborators push the songs a bit to make things better. I've become less stubborn and am going to have a much better album because of it.  Later, while shopping on 5th Avenue with Irene and Dan Hamill, we ran into Robin and her man Damon. It was a birthday, so Happy Birthday to the best bandmate I've ever had! We discussed the real band name for ass cobra, which led to Mr. Hamill making a wisecrack that we will get tons of mileage out of. See you at Golden Unicorn, bitch!  The evening was capped off with a screening of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, which should be huge, but won't be, but was nonetheless enjoyable. The kids in the movie, in particular one of the sidekicks (who Irene has dubbed the new John Cusak), really carried it. And the presence of AJAX from the Warriors, James Remar, never hurts.  I spent Easter immersed in all things Clone Wars. And speaking of Jedi, I ran into the star of my NYU senior thesis film, SUBURBAN JEDI, this morning. HIs name is Kosak, I love him and it was good to see him. He is strong with the force, still, especially if he moves to France. So jealous.  Note to self: Plan vacation!  F         "
"             It's been an incredibly stressful week thanks to my totally screwing up my laptop while trying to upgrade my powerbook to OSx. I've been through too much with this, so I dare not explain. However, massively public kudos to my significant other for handling my 'suicide watch' with a nice dinner at Wonton Garden. If my computer is salvaged, I will post in depth as to what happened and why and how. As for now, fuck it.  Brandt has gone on in depth in my recent absence regarding certain events and for once he is mostly accurate. The session with Ash was fun and to hear the edited drums for the first time really got the adrenaline pumping. It made me want to get this record out next week, but sadly there is still work to be done.  As for The Twilight Singers gig, my memories, based on copious amounts of Sake, Beer, Gin and Tonic and the DREADED Jagermeister are as such: the gig was too short (in my drunken mind it was a half hour), they played no Whigs songs (they played several), and Dull is, well, a fat fuck. I supposedly screamed this loudly. This is my attempt at being more 'British.' Also, I recall me and my friends huddled and hopping up and down singing along, which also means we have seen too many British people at gigs.  Last night we checked out the always impressive Saintface. They were fun and energetic and peter's CONSTANT abuse of Matt Gentile from the stage was super fun ;-) Before I start bitching about their album not being done, they ARE doing rough mixes now before bringing a mixer in, so they are in good shape. I am also told that I will be lucky enough to hear these rough mixes. Peter if you're reading, PLEASE don't forget me, Ill even give you NO notes at all so i don't fuck anything up ;-)   Also, Peter needs to watch out for crazy Goths dancing in front of the stage. HEY, this aint Joy Machine, sister!!  Saintface opened up for a band called Blondes, Inc. who I liked in a BRMC club kinda way. I thought the rhythm section was tight, allowing the keytarist and guitarist to drive the vocal melodies. I bought the CD, so I'll decide then if I like them or not! However, they were smart enough to invite Saintface to open for them, so that's a point in their favour. However, the scary couple making out next to Irene was wayyyy too distracting. You had to see that one.  In the end, we had a good crew and the face guys are always nice. Peter and I have settled on his singing two songs for EXIT STRATEGIES, which he has yet to hear, but those songs are called CLEAN UP and EXIST. I know that these two tracks will be massive with him on vocals. Also, I breathe a sigh of relief that he is doing those two songs as we have always had these songs in mind for him. He was the last piece of the puzzle for this record and now its in!  The aggression are making their return to compact disc later this year with a rare remix making an appearance on an upcoming compilation in the US. It will be Needleye's awesome remix of MY WHITE NOVA and I'll send more details when it's all official, etc.  While Brandt is editing, I have started to slowly move the HF Live Machine forward a bit. There is no timetable to play, but there is an idea as to who should be in this band. Besides Me, Brandt, Robin and Ash, I'm happy to report that the last aggression keyboard player, The Kidd, now is the first Hypefactor keyboard player. Honestly, I think this is a more exciting gig for him than the aggression. It's more of a challenge. I'm told Robin is concerned juggling two bands is going to be tough when it comes to playing live. I disagree and plus, double bills could rock! Assfactor, anyone?   I'm back in the studio tonight for bass overdubs, then we're checking out some Death Cab on Thursday. It's a good life, kids.  F           "
"             A friend of mine once said that beer is the force that gives us peeing. And on Saturday evening it gave the MOGpac the resplendent  urlLink Twilight Singers , cloaked in a thick fog of soul, whiskey and illicit cigarette smoke at Brooklyn's  urlLink Warsaw . For their second major American tour in six months, Greg Dulli's post-Afghan Whigs project put on a storming set reminiscent of the 2001 gig we caught at Bowery Ballroom in support of  Twilight As Played By...  This will sound blasphemous to some longstanding Dulli fans, but the gig almost made up for my having missed The Whigs' final national tour - in support of the stunning  1965  - as the group closed with two of my favorite numbers from that LP.  Mind you, the gig could have been a disaster of epic proportions. And as F, Irene, The Kidd, G and I sat at the Polish National Home's bar drinking  urlLink Zywiec , this possibility lingered in the backs of our minds. During the first leg of the band's  Blackberry Belle  tour last year, sets ran three hours or longer as Dulli, a glutton of epic proportions, drank himself into a stupor and told 20-minute stories to the audience while the band looped introductions to their songs ad nauseum. We learned about   urlLink Amber Headlights  , the near-complete Twilights album that was scrapped upon the death of Dulli's friend, director Ted Demme. And about Elliot Smith drinking at Dulli's Los Angeles bar, The Short Stop. And about Dulli screwing his college girlfriend to Marvin Gaye and Kate Bush. It was charming and funny for a few minutes, then wore thin rapidly. How thin? The Kidd - the most ardent of Dulli fans and the man responsible for introducing the MOGpac to The Whigs - walked out of the gig.  Luckily Saturday's gig was brisk and succinct, wrapped up in a timely two hours. 'Uptown Again,' 'Up In It' and 'Somethin' Hot' sounded boozy as ever, while the gentler tunes from the debut Twilights LP were infused with new rock and swagger. Dulli said little but teased the crowd a few times, making reference to the fans' distaste for his Storytellers routine on the previous tour (he pulled the same gimmick at almost every show in the fall, and was deservedly reviled by fans and critics alike.)   And it probably did not hurt that copious amounts of beer were consumed before and during the gig, punctuated by a round of Jaegermeister for all. F was in rare form, putting 'em back in a way I had not seen since we hit up KGB Bar with  urlLink Jamie Duffy . The next time you see him, ask him what he remembers about this evening.  In other Dulli news, The Twilights are releasing a full-length album of covers this summer, while the man is recording a separate LP with ex-Screaming Tree Mark Lanegan under the moniker of  urlLink The Gutter Twins . Dulli and Lanegan claim that group will tour, playing songs by all of their affiliated bands and covers with a revolving cast of musicians. I am hoping we will be seeing more of Greg in the coming year.         "
"             After more months of drum sessions in Garden City than I care to remember, the Factor Corp. - sans Robin, who was deservedly cavorting with her boyfriend - met at Birdcage for a meeting/listening session covering the drum recordings and edits thus far. We had not been in a room together for some time, and it was good to see everyone and catch up on life.  Reaction was largely upbeat, especially to 'Our Faith,' 'Exist' and 'Leningrad.' 'Our Faith' has the most work complete thus far, as it was the first edit I tackled using Ableton's Live, a stellar program for time correction. At best, however, the process is tedious. I  could  complete a song per day... if I were putting in a 12-hour day of editing. But real life shit means that I'm getting through a song about every three to four days, thereby making most of April editing time. Ugh.  The one point of contention came up during 'Theme From Propaganda,' Ash's Russian club monster with live bass and guitars. Robin played a staggered drum pattern over the 4/4 programming that I love, even in its unedited form, but that Ash and F hate on the basis that it makes the song too busy. I am standing by my opinion of the drums... for now. But the song is Ash's baby, so once I finish my edits this week, I will hand over the drum parts to him and let him make the final call.  Yesterday the band also had the opportunity to meet Kathie, my long-time photographer friend who will be shooting the Factor photos for the CD art and Web site. Kathie sat in on about half of the session, listening to us bicker and lending me cigarettes. And she was quite charmed by F and Ash, who have rubbed off on me, apparrently. I am not certain what this means, and Kathie did not care to elaborate, but I will assume this is a good thing.  Random aside: About half of the new Skinny Puppy album is amazing. Absolutely fucking amazing. Industrial may not be dead after all, if only the kids will rally to support this.  The evening before I caught the hipster gig of the year, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Rapture in a double headlining stop at Roseland Ballroom. It was my first time seeing both bands, as I made the massive error of missing BRMC during their stops at Warsaw and Irving Plaza in 2003. The good: BRMC were stellar, and The Rapture sounded far more tuneful and coherent live than they do on their 'breakthrough' LP,  Echoes , revered by every white twentysomething in Brooklyn with an afro. The bad: The audience, which was exactly what you would expect at this gig. The worse: The vibe of both bands' best performances was ruined by the crowd's indifferent, muted response to everything. Shouldn't blistering performances of 'Stop' and 'Love Burns' warrant a bit more enthusiasm? I would think so.  The unexpcted: The audience popped the hardest for 'Olio,' 'I Need Your Love' and a few other Rapture tunes with only electronics and drum machines. Strange, given the hipster crowd's fondness for sloppy guitars. And the ridiculous: The Rapture's Gabe Andruzzi, whose onstage antics proved that, unlike Blue Oyster Cult, his band does  not  need more cowbell.  Speaking of up-and-coming bands playing obnoxiously large and overhyped shows, seeing BRMC and The Rapture reminded me of why I  didn't  bother to see the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at Hammerstein Ballroom earlier in the year. As much as I adore this band, I cannot imagine their energy translating well in any venue larger than Irving Plaza. And at the risk of sounding like the elitists who selfishly want success to elude small bands, the point of all this is lost on me when gigs become hipster clusterfucks. A friend of mine put it best the other evening: 'Damn, we were lucky to see them when we did.'         "
"             First things first, thanks to the Quizmo website, I have created 'Test Your MOGness' quiz for the members of the MOGpac. This quiz is designed mostly for the 8 or so people that would possibly get it, but dammit of those 8 people who have taken it thus far, there has been much amusement. It really takes the piss out of the whole crew. Further to the 24 Quiz discussed previously, Brandt took it and was Tony, and Ash took it and was Michelle, Tony's wife. If you know these people, this makes perfect sense. Then Dan Hamill took it and was Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter, which in this silly world of ours, makes even sense that G himself would be a hot chick...  Moving on...  Being as burnt out as I am from the recent LA adventure and then subsequent real life work related matters that have kept me from home this week, I was excited to have a good nights rest yesterday and then hit the studio for a solid (half day) or work. We began with the computer-based grunt work of adding the new parts Leo did in LA for OUR FAITH to the original song file. I loved the arrangement Leo and I conceived for the song, so it was my job to get that in shape. Arrangement is one of my strong points, so while this may be a boring job for some, this is my bread and butter. It didnt take too long, but I wanted to spend some time going through everything thats been recorded for the song to see what would stay and go. By doing this, I was able to create a cool blend of the original (recorded with Jamie Birthday Boy Duffy) and the new version (recorded with Leo). We got us a hot song here.  Next was more fun, as I finally got to get my musical hands on the latest track, DESCRIPTIVE, which I had yet to do anything but arrange. As I type, I'm waiting for B to send over the mp3 of it, but we created a new intro that has all the elements of the chorus, minus the guitars, but with the addition of some F-Bass.  Brandt wants this song to end as a fade, so we added this bass to the fading chorus at the end. Inspired, I began writing some lyrics down so I wouldn't forget while B added some synth and strings to the chorus. I'm really loving this song, and while I don't think it fits on the album (and was never intended to be), I am enormously proud of what my mates did here and I hope we can play this baby live.  Upon discussing where we are at with the albun, it's been decided to start vocals earlier than planned as the drum editing is going to slow for my tastes (however, this will bring us nothing short of perfection thanks to B). So I should be back there on Monday starting this.  It was too nice outside after a few crap days of weather, so B and I hit the record shop for our usual round of spending way too much. Got the new MOJO/NME special on The Smiths and seeing Oasis on the cover of the new Q made my day.  Later that night, Irene, G and I went to see SHREK 2. I am not a big fan of the first one, which I liked, but damn this second one is HILARIOUS, thanks in part to really funny voice work from Antonia Banderes and Rupert Everett. Really funny, go see it.  And now I must prepare for the long awaited Pizza-Off event in which Irene and my dad will battle to see who makes the better Pizza here at MOGworld. My dad, who doesnt cook is about to get his ass handed to him I think, as Irene makes a damn fine Pizza. The Winner in all this is ME, who gets to eat all of this!  F         "
"             So while arranging the song B, Ash, Robin and Charles wrote, DESCRIPTIVE, we paused to eat some Great Wall and watch the Season Finale of 24, which was really good. Not great, but really good. Jack's breakdown at the end was a good way to end it. The War goes on and Jack Bauer will not tire! Anyhow, The show's not back on till January and I have a feeling it will be a very different show. Seasons 1 and 2 were classic and quite frankly, Season 3 had a lot to live up to and occasionally delivered. It's time to change up the formula. However, speaking of season finale's, SMALLVILLE was awesome and they re really shaking up that show in a good way. They got rid of a lot of characters supposedly and had a well crafted cliffhanger. Kudo's to that writing staff.  I took a quiz that was called 'Which 24 Character are you most like' and this was the answer: 'You are MOST like JACK BAUER. Your motives are pure, but your tactics are ruthless, fearless and uncompromising. You value loyalty, honour and tradition. You don't trust people easily, but when they do earn your trust, you are loyal to them, sometimes to a fault. You are quick-witted, resourceful and a bit of a badass. You love danger and taking risks, but will not hesitate to put yourself on the line for your beliefs and the people you care about.'  I think i AM a bit of a badass, though I hope I don't have a heroin habit by next season.  As for the new song, it's damn good and the kids have left me a lot to work with. I don't know if they will love the arrangement, but you can't make everyone happy. I already have vocal melodies for it. It gets quite electronic in the middle, which I love. It will be great for the single.It needs some more meat on it, though I'm not sure what it needs yet or if even I'm the man to do it. Regardless, this track is certainly worthy of the HF catalogue. My compatriots are a mean force.  Meanwhile, Brandt gave me a new edit of CREATION PHASE where the intro was significantly chopped. The song has much more punch now, which really takes it over the top (a good thing). it makes sense. Also, he recorded some extra guitars for LENINGRAD, which were good but needed proper placement, so we spent sometime on that. Now that song's just about perfect.   Brandt will now be spending the next week plus editing drums. Closer and Closer. We need to be careful not to start overthinking shit.   While I am a newcomer to THE SOPRANO's, my love for Drea De Matteo is everlasting. Watching her get beat up and now supposedly killed on that show is too much for me. I have a feeling which she appears next season on the FRIENDS spin-off JOEY, I doubt we will see Matt LaBlanc smacking her around.  And finally the newest issue of the BATTLE ROYALE manga has arrived, so I'm off!  F          "
"             As I got up to grab some iced tea from the fridge (now a staple at Birdcage to cut down on Wendy's bills), the searing pain in my arms reminded me of something I forgot to mention in my previous post: the MOGpac's first appearance at the Tournament Of Champions dodgeball league.  I will keep the history and details about this event to a minimum, as I hope Mattagement (an organizing principle of MOG Athletics) will go into specifics about that here. But a few key observations:   - The MOGpac should probably spend weekends brushing up on their skills, as the team went one for five, despite a good showing during our warmup session outside MLK Jr. High School.   - A defensive/catching game is probably the way to go because, with few exceptions, we throw like girls. Sorry ladies.   - The MVP award for the day belongs to Charles LaBarbara, who went one-on-one against a chick and brought the MOGpac its only victory of the championship. The ref would take umbrage at Charles' name being used in the same sentence as MVP, but he's not here right now, so fuck it.   - The only team the 'pac beat has a player who the crowd referred to alternately as Tolkien or a Hobbit. I am not sure what this says about us.   - The 'Nastiest Smack' award goes to Robin Emmet, who took one for the team square in the chest when she was the only one left on the court. Not even FJ's frequent spatula attacks could have prepared the poor girl for that hit, which resonated throughout the gym. While we lost that match, the hecklers booed the opposing team for beating up on a lone girl. Do moral victories exist in dodgeball?   - The MOGpac received its most savage beating at the hands of a team named after a Spinal Tap album. We hath smelt the glove, and the stench was foul.   - If you are a team of irate alpha males, calling yourselves the 'Richard Ryders' is an unfortunate decision.  The good news is that we met a couple of other dodgeballers who were competing for the second time at the tournament, and their team made it to the playoffs after a one-and-five showing the month beforehand. Indeed, miracles do happen. Now all we need are t-shirts.         "
"             I admit I was supposed to write this post days ago, but I am back to editing drums for  Exit Strategies  and keeping everyone up to date went on the backburner for a few days. So please excuse my poor sense of timing.  But as FJ wrote yesterday, while he cavorted with industry types in Los Angeles on Wednesday, the Factor Corp. board met at Birdcage to hammer out the foundation of the band's first new song in seven months. The recording was planned at my encouragement, and I admit it is nonsensical to dive into a new recording while we are waist-deep in edits and overdubs for the full-length. That being said, the fans will be treated to a new hypefactor release this year before the album - I'll leave it up to FJ to fill in the details when he sees fit - and we wanted to include something exclusive. This track will most likely be it.  The directive for the song, per FJ, was to compose something emphasizing electronics rather than guitars. Guitars drive the melodies and rhythms of  Exit Strategies , with few exceptions, and we both thought it would be clever to do something radically different here. A number of structural ideas and potential 'blueprints' for the tune were bandied about via IM before F left for Los Angeles, and the general consensus was to fashion a pop song whose melody and atmosphere are driven by rhythm loops and synth melodies. I refined some structural ideas further while listening to some NewOrder b-sides from their  Get Ready  era, both of which were synth-based tracks recorded during that band's otherwise rockist period.  And as always happens with this band, plans and ideas rarely materialize as intended, and for the better. The core of Robin, Ash and I were joined by Ass Cobra bassist Charles LaBarbara the evening of the session, much to Robin's surprise and delight (as she and Chaz get along swimmingly). Ash and I cued up some loops we had prepared in Ableton Live, while Charles played bass and Robin played synth drums on her Roland electronic kit... a first for us. As Charles' funky bass part came together, however, both Ash and Robin drifted toward guitars, and they recorded some dark, chordy progressions of which I am quite fond. Ironically, no electronics (aside from the basic loops and Robin's drums) were tracked that evening. Not what I had intended by a long stretch, but the result felt right.  I took that direction one step further the next day while jamming along to Robin's drums and Charles' precise, machine-like bass line, which will probably form the verse/chorus structure for the tune. Their playing had such unexpected drive to it that I tracked some acoustics and a brisk, zingy electric riff in a few hours of inspiration. I also pulled in a lot of new loops from a prep session I had done earlier in the week, many of which may stay pending FJ's arrangement overhaul. As I wrote to F today, the song is only 10 to 15 percent of the way there, so it could be a reggae song by the time we are wrap it up next month. But the song in its current form has far more verve than I anticipated, and I am thrilled with the direction it has taken thus far.  A substantial part of the song's feeling derives from Charles' bass part, which I think is one of the best things this group has committed to tape in some time. There are countless studio moments - Ash's guitar riff in the bridge of 'Exist,' FJ's bass in 'Clean Up,' Robin's drumming on 'Solar' - where I thank my lucky stars I play in this band, and Charles' performance on Wednesday was of that quality. I, for one, hope (and think) this will not be his only appearance on a hypefactor recording.  The last time I posted I promised to say something about ex-industrialist Chris Connelly's new record,  Night Of Your Life , which came out last week. FJ and I had the luxury of digesting a pre-release copy of this album for a matter of months, and after listening to the finished product I still believe Connelly has not recorded anything this brilliant since  Blonde Exodus , if not  Shipwreck . This feat is all the more impressive considering that those records were recorded with full bands, while producer/longtime collaborator Chris Bruce and a keyboardist are Connelly's only accompaniment on  Night Of Your Life . Bruce, a wildly talented multi-instrumentalist and member of Seal's backing band, deserves a huge amount of credit for providing the lushness this batch of tunes required. Given hipsters' penchant for singer-songwriter types these days, I will never understand why 'Stella Stand Up And Take Your Man' is not a massive hit. Other than a certain record label's penchant for blowing goats. Oh, and the cover art, all of which was shot in Scotland, is sublime and worth the price of admission alone.  Edits and overdubs continue this week, and if all goes well vocals start on one or two songs next week. Stay tuned.         "
"             Just back from the Harry Potter premiere here in NYC. Good movie, solid direction and an extremely hilarious cameo by ex Stone Rose Ian Brown (a pal of the director's, hence the cameo). Of course in all of Radio City Music Hall only two people went mad for Ian Brown: myself and Dan Hamill (though you should have seen Mr. G pop for Emma Watson when they came out to introduce the movie, not that I blame him). As for the movie, it lacks one thing, which is a major bad guy. Let's just say Kenneth Branagh got more screentime in the last movie than Oldman does in this. Special thanks to Mattagement for hooking Irene, G and myself with tix. The post show dinner at the original hardcore Benihana was most enjoyable and as always, the company (G, Matt and Jax) is always first rate.  Stepping back to my industrial roots, I've heard the new WATTS album for the first time today. It's always fun to hear something new from Raymond, and this is no exception. With WATTS, Raymond tries some new things, going into more electronic territory while also stripping down his usually thick sound. It was a smart decision not to call this a PIG album, because with the way its produced and performed, its not. When it does sound like Pig, its more of a reference than anything. I know some of you die-hards are pissed, but quite honestly, he's smart not to fuck with the PIG brand name. I know that sounds kinda corporate, but when he goes back to doing something as PIG, no one can fuck with him when he wanted to try something different here. Having spent years tracking down almost everything the man has ever recorded, I'm a sucker for most things Watts, so I might be a bit biased.  I am told in their first outing, MOG Athletics won ONE game and lost FIVE in dodgeball. I would like to congratulate these beatiful losers on a job well done!!  F          "
"             This might be my first blog from the air. I am 3/4 of the way back to NYC from an extended stay on the West Coast. While here in the air, I want to wish Team Mogpac well on their first dodgeball game, currently being played somewhere in the big apple. I hope Matt Gentile will report the results here on the blog and I look forward to participating in the next round of what we call MOG Athletics. Considering it was Irene’s idea, I should participate.  A lot happened on my LA journey and it’s hard to remember it all because I’m so tired, but I’ll try to give you the update, as I did actually work on things to benefit the world of MOG. I won’t get too deep into my adventures at E3 as it was a massive headache and basically a huge arcade on steroids. I did enjoy seeing some of the new games and in particular, the new tech. I think we’re all going to be playing the Playstation Portable in the next few years. It was also fun to see my man Evan walk the floor of this convention like a massive rockstar (He’s an important game reviewer in the real world). The convention is huge, it’s loud. Note to self: next time bring aspirin.  Quick story: on my way to the convention, LA’s finest pulled me over for jumping into the HOV lane (like an idiot I pulled right in front of a fucking cop). However, upon seeing my Ipod in the front seat, the two policemen, who shall remain nameless, and I got into a conversation about their desire to play their Ipod in their police car. When they learned I was going to E3, I not only avoided a ticket, I also got a police escort for my trouble. Only in LA kids.  Anyhow, at a party held in honour of my lawyer/agent/advisor, Leo V23 and I huddled into a corner to discuss our musical work for the upcoming week in LA while also trying to avoid (unsuccessfully) as many entertainment industry types as possible. With our game plan set, Leo and I spent a few nights in the wee hours working on the new HF song OUR FAITH. We had been looking for Leo to come through with his unique style of atmospheric guitar playing and singing and boy did my second favourite Argentinean come through. We took what was a wall of guitars and britrock and turned into a sexy explosion of the subtly and noise. Tons of loops were removed and by doing so, the melodies really came through while also making Robin’s drums really stand out. Leo laid down some beautiful guitars and even better vocals, in Spanish no less. I used my skills in an arranging capacity and we have a brand new and interesting song that is a million times better than what I walked in there with.  Leo is used to being a solo performer, but I was really impressed with how collaborative he was. Working with him was no different than working with my best collaborators: Brandt, Ash and Robin. He would listen carefully to my ideas and even if he thought some of them wouldn’t work, he would try them, which sometimes led to him being surprised, me being surprised and most importantly, really allowing us to push the material forward. After working with “producers” and “musicians” whose egos and need to be in charge overwhelms everyone else in the room to the point where they won’t let anyone push the music forward because of their own insecurities, Leo was a joy to work with and has a place in the Factor Corporation any day.   On the topic of Leo, in between all of this I managed to catch the debut gig of his newest project AM Pacific, which continues the musical style he began several years with his previous project Sutra. This was at a private party filled mostly with hipster douches out in Los Feliz, the Williamsburg of Los Angeles (Fuck you, Fury). Leo had a very simple set up of himself on guitars and vocals, one girl on lead vocals, and another girl on vocals and trumpet (who was amazing). Beats and loops were run through a PA via Leo’s Ipod. They came on late and the people were annoying, but damn was this short set worth it. The AM trio was excellent and really delivered a beautiful set and the best cover of Chris Issak’s WICKED GAME you will ever hear.  Meanwhile I worked on artwork for a potential HF single, while my 3 cohorts teamed up with Ass Cobra’s amazing bassist Charles to work on a potential B-side, which they have titled DESCRIPTIVE. An mp3 was sent my way of the material written for this song and boy am I excited. I had a few requests of what I would like to hear in a B-side and the Factor Corp really stepped up to the plate. I’m already writing vocal melodies. I hope Brandt will go into detail about the making of this song somewhere here.  Luckily Brandt took the space to review Morrissey’s new one and I’m happy to say I’m loving the album. Another amazing return to form by a legend of days past. We need Moz and he has not let us down. Duran was the comeback of 03, and Moz is truly the comeback of 04. Thank God.  My celebrity sightings included former Melrose Place douche Patrick Muldoon, the Legendary Mickey Rourke, Apollo Creed himself Carl Weathers, current Playboy cover star Charisma Carpenter (who I was tempted to ask why she refused to show her nether regions in said photo spread, thus making the spread quite Maxim instead of Playboy), and the man Dan Hamill and I call Mr. 100 Million Dollars: Oliver Martinez, who might be the one human being Brandt hates the most on this planet besides Benicio Del Toro (who is on the airplane movie screen right now in 21 Grams). Oliver was sans Kylie, but was wearing these horrible glasses that reminded me of Dan Hamill Circa 1993. Not good. Special thanks to my friends at Ca’Brea for sitting my lawyer/agent/advisor and myself at a better table that the movie stars.  Also, the highlight of my trip was spent with the younger crowd, including the new Fury baby, in from San Fran (it was fun seeing Bradley J. Fox and my sister Dee Dee looking into their future of parenthood while playing with the Fury child). And of course, as much time as possible was spent my 5 year old nephew, who becoming more of a clone of my girlfriend every day, just as my small cousin has become a Star Wars loving Benihana eating clone of me.  Oh I saw TROY and the best part was seeing the trailer for CONSTANTINE.  New York approaches. More, much more, soon!  F          "
"             With FJ loitering outside all-male theaters on Santa Monica boulevard and sharing iPod tips with law enforcement, news on the home front is my responsibility for another week.  The past few days were rife with gigs, record purchases and hypefactor work, thankfully, so there is a lot to keep you occupied until FJ writes about the 'gig' he saw Saturday night.  First stop of the week was on Thursday at the dreaded Piano's (where personality goes to die) to see The Dansettes. Joe Babic, the perenially youthful bassist in Saintface, has dated a charming lady named Jamie for as long as anybody in the MOGpac has been going to see his band.  Unlike the worst rock 'n' roll girlfriends - a lecherous lot who date talent because they lack it themselves - Jamie is a musical firebrand in her own right, and The Dansettes are her band. A 1960s-styled girl group, no less, with Jamie and two others on vocals and a quartet of male instrumentalists. While The Dansettes are a nostalgia act in the sense that they are not doing anything to modernize the soul genre, they stay true to the tenets of the best groups from that era and have more talent and style than any other contemporary outfit claiming to be 'soul.' The set mixed obscure Northern Soul covers and originals, and it was obvious the band knows its roots because they nailed the best elements of the former in their own material. It is tragic that The Dansettes have yet to commit anything to tape, as Jamie truly has an excellent tropue on her hands.  Revelation of the evening:  Jamie can belt out those soul numbers with as much vigor and flair as her 1960s predecessors. Who knew the spirit of Dobie Gray was alive and thriving in the body of a 5-foot, 3-inch Polish girl? Utterly remarkable.  My original plans to see Saintface at Lit on Friday night were scuttled when, at the last minute, FJ discovered via Irene that Colder had their debut New York gig booked for the same evening at Rothko on the Lower East Side. Colder is the alias of Marc Tan, a French video artist who wrote and recorded some tunes to accompany his visual work. 'Again,' the album borne of those recordings, ended up being more interesting than anything Tan committed to DVD, and he was promptly signed to Output Recordings (the über-hip home of The Rapture, etc.) Reviews pegged the record as a more electronic Joy Division or Revenge, naturally piquing interest among some MOGpac members. And for the most part, the record lives up to the hype, as its absence of memorable hooks is more than compensated for with Tan's spacious programmed atmospheres.  When FJ or I carp about electronic artists' live shows, we almost always note the reliance on computers or pre-programmed material (Squarepusher, you asshole: take note). In Colder's case, however, the exact opposite was the case. Tan brought a three-piece accompaniment (guitar-bass-drums) for the tour, and his group proceeded to wreck the album's subtle delivery. It was not until the middle of the hour-long set that the group struck a rerasonable balance between the live rock and the programming, and even then with mixed success. I will rarely argue that something is too live, but the criticism holds true for Colder. Even Ash, an ardent fan of  Again  on the first listen, was underwhelmed. And our talkative guests did not help matters.  That being said, Colder drew a heck of a crowd for a show with no promotion. Every crisply-dressed indie snob in the city packed into this tiny club, making for a crowded, overheated and unpleasant wait... save for the DJ playing Die Warzau's 'Land Of The Free.'  I made the trek to Rebel Rebel on Saturday for no particular reason, only to discover that Dave had limited edition versions of Morrissey's  You Are The Quarry  in stock. In short, this is the best set of tunes old Moz has assembled since the early 1990s. There is nothing earth-shattering here, aside from the liberal use of programming and synthesizers, but the melodies are strong and as arresting as anything in the man's solo repertoire. I  will  argue that a stellar lyricist like Morrissey should align himself with more innovative songwriters and arrangers, as stated in the New York Times' review of  Quarry . Nevertheless, Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte are competent players who deliver some fine work on this album. Kudos.  PJ Harvey's new single  The Letter , on the other hand, was a letdown. Harvey chose to produce her new record herself, and limited her instrumental support to longtime collaborator Rob Ellis. While the song is pure Harvey, the production leaves a lot to be desired when held up against  Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea . A shame, really, though I will reserve final judgement for the album.  Album to be discussed later that you must pick up now:  Chris Connelly's  Night Of Your Life , out now on Underground, Inc.  Tonight:  Guitar work on 'Leningrad' to test my theory that the song is far from complete. Stay tuned...         "
"             I can only assume I am blogging so much because I am on a plane in the morning, but just to tease you, the Hypefactor Live Experience just took an interesting twist. Stay tuned.  F         "
"             From today's NME comes this years most awesome event:   NOEL GALLAGHER and IAN BROWN have collaborated on a track for the former STONE ROSES vocalist's new album. According to The Sun newspaper, the pair met by chance at the Electric Cinema in London’sNotting Hill. 'We got talking about music and agreed we should do something,' explained Brown . He added: 'Noel sent me some music he’d done and I recorded a vocal. The result is brilliant, I’m really excited. I hope it will be a single.' The news comes after denials from the Oasis camp that Liam was to form a supergroup with ex-Roses guitarist John Squire. As previously reported onNME.COM, the band claim the story was 'dreamed up' by editorial staff atThe Sun. Oasis are currently working in the studio on the follow-up to ’Heathen Chemistry’, which is due for release later this year. Brown’s new album is expected in August or September.          "
"             Though this blog is usually reserved for the musical portion of my life, I must report today that I am a victim of false reporting on the internet. It was reported on 'respected' internet movie sites this morning that I have become an Executive Producer on the forthcoming BATMAN film. While I would love nothing more in life than to produce a Batman film (and believe me this new one is going to be the bomb), I can truthfully tell you that I AM NOT an Executive Producer. I just happen to work for two of them in my 'other' life. I wanted you all to read this first as the E-mails are already coming in.   NO I AM NOT. OK? I would love to know who does this shit.  I have asked the websites to remove the false article simply because A. It's bullshit and B. Could get me in trouble. THANKS, Jett.  F         "
"             Upon finishing the post below, something was nagging at me. Like I had forgotten something. And then it hit me.  Besides this week being the 10th anniversary of the first time Mark Mothasemi and I took to the stage with the teenage versions of Ash and Tom, a year ago this past weekend, the aggression played what will be most likely be their last ever show. From what I recall, it was a good gig, though honestly, we were always good (though we got REALLY good once Robin came in). We played here in the City and the other band no showed, so we were able to do our extended set without having to cut anything. it was sparsely attended, especially in comparison to our previous NYC shows, but it was hastily put together and we had just come back from Russia when the opportunity to play arose. While we had several gigs over the past 10 years that were supposed to be our last, the one time I didn't think was the last one, was in fact, THE LAST GIG EVER (TM). I've not seen a video of this gig because, according to Matt Gentile, the tape is 'fucked up'. I nag him occasionally about this, but there's a romanticism to never seeing it  I always felt like the aggression should have gone out like the end of Michael Mann's HEAT, in an overblown blaze of glory. That gig has been played over and over in my head millions of times. From what I would wear to what I would play, the gig was preconceived for the past few years. I don't think I was alone in that as I recall Ash having a set list for such a gig (as well as several drafted letters of resignation).  I was about to share with you my thoughts on what that gig should be. I've decided against it as I think what you are speculating might be better than what I had planned.   I thought I would be more emotional about it, but I guess I got over it more quickly than I anticipated. This could be because I remain in such close,  daily, contact with the people who did matter and worked hard to make the aggression something special. Another reason, and I can see this with time having passed, I was fucking miserable in the band thanks to the lack of focus and maturity within it. But if I am anything, I am loyal and I was the general who took the ship down to a noble death.  Let's be frank, we only sold a few thousand records, we were never even a blip on a radar. However, for ten years it was the world I and a few others lived in and while I can never forgive the few who tried to fuck with it,  I love that the music and the experiences will be something no one can ever take away or tarnish. I wanted to save the industrial scene when bands i adored like Chemlab and Skinny Puppy went away. With all of these old schoolers coming back and putting out records, I can rest easier knowing we kept our elders seats warm in their absence.   From the pits of the Underworld to the former Soviet Union, the casualty rate was shockingly low and most of the friendships remain intact. Plus, some records came out that I love to pieces. They proudly hang on my well as reminders of the wonderful life I have led for 10 years.  And don't think I don't seen the irony in the fact that the one of last songs the aggression ever played was in fact, Hypefactor's SWEETEST SOUL.  HAH.  F         "
"             Been running around like mad man as I get ready for another LA trip, so bear with me if I seem, if I can coin my dentists description of my agent/manager/lawyer: Scattered.  We did the customary Mothers Day celebrating yesterday, honouring the woman who dares take the responsibility of claiming to have given birth to me. She's a nice lady, I like her, though she needs to stop working so much (which is something she would say about me). Anyhow, this brought us to Long Island (hopefully for one of the last times in my life before the nice people who raised me finally move into the City at last). Completely by coincidence, Irene and I had tickets to see her absoulte favourite band, CAVE IN, on Long Island as well. Farmingdale, no less. Notice the first part of that town's name is farm. I must admit to having a strong appreciation for Cave in, but I am less appreciative of these far out parts of Long Island. Well, it was another flashback to pre-drivers license days, as Irene and I were driven by my aunt and uncle (also nice people, who have seen many aggression shows in their lives, poor things) to the venue, which was on the 'main street' of town. Talk about Suburbia. We couldn't wait to get the hell out of this town! Who in their right mind lives out here!  Anyhow, the gig was good. The young guys in this band are shockingly gifted musicians. They write complex, catchy songs and this was the first time I was able to check them out in a small venue. They are loud and talented as hell. I love their album ANTENNA, which strays from their previous hardcore sound, so when they dip back into the catalog, I am not as excited, but because they play so well, it's enjoyable nonetheless. Their new material steps back a little bit to the harder side of things, but with a 70's rock bent. Could be good. Stay tuned. Great band!  Irene being up at 5:30am for work this morning really kicked me in the ass and it sent me straight down to the studio in the morning for what will be my last round in the studio for the next few weeks. I spent the whole day there, and we got some work done. It may not feel like much, but what we did was very important for the record. We offficially wrapped up guitar tracking today as Brandt laid down his acoustics for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Again, I played the role of engineer and it's something I need to do more of instead of letting everyone go and just do their things. Hypefactor was orginally intended for me to improve on my bass playing and singing and I think I have met those goals. Now, I need to focus on producing, though I'd like to apply that to another project, i.e. Chemlab, and then bring what I learn into the HF experience. Anyhow, something to think about. I also took the opportunity to have B tutor me in how to use the program LIVE, which he and Ash often use to edit loops and such. I need some practive on this fucker!  We also wrapped up a remix that has been sitting around. A while back, Brandt had started some remixes of two songs from THE DISTRACTED LOVER. They were good drafts, but I felt they needed some more work. We just never got around to it. Last night at Cave In, they were selling a limited edition live CD that they pressed on their own and this inspired me to want to do something for HF; possibly a giveaway using those remixes. In my mind right now, and it's being planned that way, it will be THE SWEETEST SOUL EP, and we will give it out over the website. I spent part of the morning re-listening to the remixes and I heard changes that could be made on the remix of THIEVES very quickly. Needless to say, we worked fast and have a nice completed remix. I have to really sit with the other remix as it needs a ton of work on my return.   In my fan boy moment of the day, I ordered the new solo album from Sakurai Atsushi of Buck Tick. My old friend Wayne Hussey of the Mission, who did a wonderful remix for us years ago, wrote a song on the album as do Bryan Haloblack and Mr. Watts himself. These are more than enough reasons to buy this disc. Hope it rocks.  My posting will be less frequent over the next few weeks thanks to my heading to the left coast, so hopefully my comrades will fill the void a bit. Behave.  F         "
"             An extremely productive time was had at the Birdcage today as we came closer to wrapping up all the guitar overdubs. In fact, we might be done entirely if Brandt kept working after I left (though I doubt it). Regardless, the light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter as we progress in large measures towards the mixing stage.  Like last week, I again stepped into the engineer's chair as Brandt not only re-recorded several guitar parts, but committed some new ideas to disk. I won't bore you with the details as it was a tedious but necessary task, but he started off doing some wonderful work in the rapidy evolving CREATION PHASE. The parts he wrote for this song are not simple, but the ease in which he lays them down would make you think otherwise. His attention to detail may be as tight as as Dan Hamill's anus, but it's worth it. Anyway, I think now we can finally put that tune to rest.  Next came the guitar lead for 1956. When the song was originally started in the aggression, Tom had done a riff which I thought was a good starting point for something that could work in the chorus. It was the usual Tom throwaway riff that he probably wasnt even paying attention to when he wrote it, and probably couldn't remember even playing. Anyhow, I remembered it and wrote my vocal melody to it. Realizing his riff wouldnt work as written, I took the extremely rare opportunity to pick up the guitar and re-write and perform the part myself. I'm happy to say my favourite two words: FULL SUCCESS apply here. I am under the impression that this is the only time I have picked up a guitar for this album, and this was the first guitar lick I have written since the verse leads for THE MOTIVE way back when. This worked out well and inspired Brandt to pick up his guitar to layer something over it. In a matter of minutes, the song went to a new level. Stay tuned!  Afterwards, we attempted to re-record Brandt's intro guitars to SOLAR, but I wasn't happy with the guitar tones he was working with. After some time, and much to my delight, Brandt decided to stick with his original recording from the demo and would fix the timing of it in Live to make it dead on perfect. I'm very much sold on that sound so Brandt, if you're reading this, don't change your freakin' mind. KEEP THAT PART...  Sometime during this, we had a special guest visit us in the form of Matt Gentile. As some of you may or may not know, Matt laboured many years as the aggression's manager and my original bass tech. I refer to him often as Mattagement. Thanks to him we've seen places and things on this planet the average rock band will never see or even dream of in their lifetime. He's the guy you call and say 'I wanna play some shows in Russia' and days later,  you're headlining major cities in foreign countries. Along with Dan Hamill, he is the co-conspirator of our MOG trips abroad and has never failed in his duties to us as a mattager or as a friend. I never question a thing when Matt is leading the charge and this had led the some of the greatest adventures of my life.  Anyway, he had some time to kill before seeing Morrissey's last night at the Apollo, so he came to listen to the new songs for the first time. It was good to have a fresh perspective on the material from someone who knows that the hell they are talking about. Because the aggression has gone the way of Suffolk County, Matt and I have existed soley on a friendship level this past year. However, I was excited to see him slip back into his professional mode and start discussing things like what the single should be, what song we should open gigs with and how we should have an EPK on the new CD. All great ideas.   I guess I should ask the handsome bastard to manage the Hype. Someone remind me, thanks. ;-)  I'm off to LA this week, so time is short and we're stealing as many moments as possible to make sure Brandt has everything he needs to work with in my absence. We're in good shape. The idea now is to be ready to mix the whole thing in JULY. I make note of this now to see when we actually DO start mixing someday.  In the meantime, say hi to your MOMS.  F         "
"             Jesus, where do I begin? Last night, and at long last, Irene and I made the trek to Harlem to the legendary Apollo Theatre to see Morrissey take to the stage for the first time here in many years. We’re both sick with colds and the weather was crap, but we were psyched.  There was a large line to get into the venue and who of course was at the near front of this line? None other than Peter, Joe and Michael, three-fifths of my favourite band Saintface. Decked out in identical denim, the lads were, to say the least, excited. It was an NME moment. To say Saintface loves and has been influenced by Morrissey/The Smiths would be an understatement compared to one describing me as a “casual” Star Wars fan. These guys were ready to rumble. Little did I know what was to come…  This was my first visit to the Apollo and I was shocked at how small this venue was. However, my shock turned to pure joy when I discovered that our 4th row Orchestra Left tickets gave us an extremely close, unobstructed view of the stage (this moment was observed by Joe Saintface from the last row of Orchestra Left). I’ve had some choice seats before (i.e. the legendary Depeche Mode Jones Beach show a few years ago, thank you Matt Gentile), but these were CLOSE. Needless to say, Irene and I were buzzing when we arrived at our seats while former NY Doll David Johansen was playing.   In between sets, a disgruntled Peter Saintface came by (did I mention, all the way from the last row of Orchestra left) to tell us how inherently wrong it was that we had better seats than the Saintface crew. Without saying so, my dear friend was saying “motherfucker, you don’t DESERVE those seats” (and quite frankly, I concede that those lads are more hardcore than I could ever be and deserving of the best seats). In another NME moment, I told him which band he should stick with if he wants to see some rock n roll up close. All light-hearted though, I’m just busting balls, because quite honestly, I know we were all happy to be there.  Finally, the lights went down and the intro music began. The die-hards ran to the front as did part of our row, giving Irene and I a lot of room to watch the show. Suddenly, Michael Saintface appeared next to me. His genuine excitement for the imminent arrival of Morrissey reminded me of when my mom took me out of school to see the first showing of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in 1980. He’s already an intense dude, but this was pure love (though slightly scary), and I must admit, it was infectious. Before I could even respond, Michael had run to the dead center of the security barrier to join his two bandmates as they welcomed their idol to the stage with hundreds of other screaming fans. We were close, but Saintface was now closer.  And there he was, Moz himself, looking lean, handsome and stylish. And honestly, with this crowd, the man could do no wrong. Granted, he’s not the wildman of the olden days, but he commands the stage in a unique and special way. His band, led by the ever-talented Boz Boorer, was tight and kept the pace up. The addition of a keyboardist (who also played horns and bongos) was welcome. And the fans, including the three members of Saintface dead center, went ballistic. Morrissey delivered a great performance. His show was centered around his forthcoming album and I’m happy to say the songs don’t suck. He chose his set list carefully, a Smiths song (THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT) here, a solo classic (EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY) there. It was enough to keep us engaged and entertained while serving as a reminder as to why this man deserves his status as “legend”. We sang along, we laughed, and we had fun.   But the fun came not only from the gig, but from the audience…A guy seated in the row ahead of us decked out in a painted denim jacket that said MORRISSEY IS GOD, had run to the front to deliver Moz daffodils (someone had to). While his friends stayed in their seats and kept bringing him drinks, he patiently waited for Moz to come near him. This dude’s hard work paid off as his love of Morrissey was consummated not only when Moz graciously accepted the flowers, but then later allowed this man to kiss his hand. The look on this guys face when he turned back to his friends was priceless. His patient friends were very excited for him and I have to admit, Irene and I were quite happy for him. It’s rare when you can feel that kind of pure joy for someone at a gig.  After years of being pissed off by his 45-minute sets of the past, Moz played a very full and hearty set. He returned to the stage to do the Smiths’ classic HAND IN GLOVE, which for old fan like me, was a welcome surprise.  Even better was when Moz ripped off his shirt and threw it into the front row and left for good while several fans, like SHARKS, jumped for the shirt. Now normally I wouldn’t even mention such a thing if it hadn’t been for the fact that of the half dozen or so fans fighting for a piece of this shirt, the scariest, most intense fan vying for a piece was none other than Michael Saintface. Now, at this point the houselights are up and this shirt is STILL being violently fought over. These fans are not letting go! Security can’t even break this one up. They’re rolling over the seats! Upon realizing Michael was in the thick of it, Irene and I rushed over to cheer him on. “C’MON MIKE! DO IT FOR SAINTFACE!”, we yelled. Pieces are broken off, and some fans are leaving, but Michael, reaching levels of TAXI DRIVER era Deniro ferociousness, is still struggling to get him some Moz. Suddenly, the joke wasn’t funny anymore.   Peter jumped in on this chaos when, after 10 minutes of struggle, it came down to Michael vs. one very aggressive woman. Little did Michael know that this woman is Saintface’s ASCAP rep who handles their publishing!!! Realizing this, Peter started asking Michael not to KILL this woman, thinking of course they will never see any publishing money. Eventually, thanks to Peter, they were able to each get a small piece of the shirt. I don’t think Michael spoke after this, but as I said to him on the way out, “Man, I’m glad your own our side!”. Joe Saintface, non-plussed by any of chaos, quietly convinced a roadie give him a set-list, so he was quite happy.  Later, as Peter was walking out with an oversized mounted poster of Moz on the cover of Spin (given to him by the same ASCAP rep!), he informed us that this fight for the shirt is a regular tradition amongst them. Go figure. Also, and I’m warning those of you who are going to see Moz this week, Michael Saintface is going to be BACK for another show (not sure which). When the shirt flies, RUN. Let the man have it, for God’s sake! He’s a good guy, but he’s got a bad case of Moz-it is! (I hope he takes this all in good fun!)  To say Irene and I were entertained by both the show and the events afterwards would again be another understatement. To the guy with the daffodils, I applaud you. To Saintface, It was an honour to see you leather clad warriors lose your cool and be true fans of music for one night.  And to Morrissey, all is forgiven.  F           "
"             It's a lazy day in MOGworld as Irene has been downed by a mediocre 2am cheeseburger that didn't agree with her (damn you Gramercy!) and I'm just flat out beat. We enjoyed seeing the entire MOG collective last night for the KIDD's birthday; however I am sad I missed Dan Hamill lapdance both men AND women. I'm sure all I have to do is ask...  With Irene asleep, I've just finished watching Serpico, completing my inadvertant study of old school Al Pacino movies. GodDAMN, he was so good when he was young! I also used this weekend to catch up on recent Korean cinema. I watched first watched NATURAL CITY, which was described to me as the Korean BLADE RUNNER. Sure enough, it's almost the same plot, just with a few different twists, and not neary as good a film as Ridley's masterpiece. However, it looked fantastic, it was bloody and violent and I had fun watching, but it lacked substance. Next up was the highly recommended 2009 LOST MEMORIES which was pretty good, but not the classic I was told it was going to be. It had an interesting plot, but it meandered on. Plus it was shot on video, which was a big problem for me. However, I think Korea is the next big center of action movies, they just need to focus more on the stories and characters cause the directors are quite good and the ideas are very original (except when they're ripping off BLADE RUNNER).  Anyway, I made two pit stops into the studio this weekend and here's what went down:  LENINGRAD, originally known as TWO BASS, has finally been edited down to an acceptable length. It's original running time was over 7 minutes and after some rough vocals and some notes from Ash, I realized that this song would work better as an instrumental at a shorter length. Brandt and I had gone over the changes a few weeks ago with Ash and I pointed out what I planned to do, but I made sure to give myself some time to go over the track to make sure those changes are right. I got in front of the computer and it got it down very quickly to about 4 minutes plus change. It's tight now and I think it's going to work out great when we have the final drums in there.  Yesterday marked, in my mind, a pretty historic moment as for the first time Brandt asked me to record HIM playing guitars. Usually he just goes and does his own thing, unless we're jamming or writing, but he's never asked me to play producer for his guitar playing till now. Due to a computer crash some months ago, some of the parts to THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE has to be re-recorded, and then several other parts had to be re-recorded to fit Ash's new basslines. I recorded a LOT of Brandt and all of it was quite awesome. The song rocks, and like every other song, it's going to blow up when we have the final drums in there.  I don't think Brandt has much left to do other than re-track a few things here and there, but then its on to the final drum editing. Once he's done with that, I'll start on the final vocals. We've started to talk about HOW to release this album, and right now we're leaning towards putting it out ourselves just to avoid the problems I've had over the years with labels. I'm at that age where the record deal means less and putting out a finished album that I'm 150% happy with means more.  Now I must make soup!  F         "
"             I'm still digging the Ryan Adams album immensely to the point where it's taking me time to get focused on the new Cure album. Upon the first few listens, I'm really liking the songs and the band sounds really inspired and motivated. In particular, Mr. Smith is pissed as hell on this record. I like that. However, I think the production blows, the mixing is flat and the severe raping of the defining Simon Gallup bass tone severly damages this album for me. I have a feeling that after seeing them perform these songs live at the end of next month I will appreciate them more. While I love the influence the producer has had on the band in terms of writing and performance, I think he should have stayed far away from the mixing.  Since you last read me, I have been spending signficant time between both of my bands. For the aggression, I solidified the tracklisting for the album and it will truly complete that era of music. I then proceeded to go hogwild (heheh) and do 95% of the artwork for it. The front cover is something I have been dying to commit to CD for some time, It's a photo of Iceland at night (taken by Brandt), but I'm just waiting on a few fonts to get it totally into shape. Thanks to Leo, I have all the fonts from FLOOD, so there will be continuity from the previous full length (Similar to the first two aggression CD's). I'll post the cover when it's done.  Meanwhile, check out www.theaggression.com for details on the new album as well an update on what the various members who DON'T post on this Blog are up to.  As for Hypefactor, Brandt and I took another stab at 1956 on Monday. We cracked it even further. Usually I would think at this point we are overthinking the song, but in reality the song needs this work and it's becoming more organic as we progress. This time, Brandt finally had the live drums ready to play with the song and Robin is so fierce on it that we dropped another load of loops out of the song. Like I said, organic. Thanks to those new guitar parts from Leo, the vocal melodies need to totally change. Thats my next assignment. B did a really cool rough mix for me to take along so I'm at work as we speak!  I've started to give friends and family a sneak peak at the material and the response has been very strong, I'm happy to say.  I gave Almost Bar Fighter Dan Hamill a sneak preview and he was impressed and very complimentary. He's probably my biggest litmus test of music outside the musical core. Because he is not a musican (he is a stage actor), he represents 'the people'...I think.  In the meantime, the THIRD band I have had the pleasure of being associated with has a nice review in Outburn this month and a good interview with Mr. Louche himself. Read it HERE: http://trixvintage.com/outburnchemlab.jpg (Thanks to whoever posted it on the Cracknation site).  On deck this week is seeing SPIDERMAN 2 tomorrow night. Then, we have a gathering of the Factor Corp. principles (Brandt, Ash, Robin, myself and now Charles) scheduled for Thursday night to review everything. Hopfully no one will flake because I really want all of these people in a room asap. All that's left is the vocals for 1956 and Peterface. The light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter.  F         "
"             I'd like to take a quick moment to announce the arrival of the newest little member of the MOGpac...Lucia Mary Magdalene Link, born June 24, 2004 12:36 a.m.  7 pounds, 8 ounces and 52 centimeters. First child of longtime founding member of MOGworld Chris Link and his wife Nina. Said child is already being spoiled by me and my significant other!  In other news, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE made me pee myself silly. Not a great movie by any means, but entertaining as hell. SWEET!  F            "
"             A whirlwind of a day ended at 3am last night and after a long day of the au bon pain, studio, chinese food, fixing my fonts, more studio, Pluck U, Saintface, many drinks, soical time with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, a near barfight, a guy in a thong (yes he was the near barfight), a very public threesome (yes this involved the guy in the thong), and some pizza, I feel we all earned the right to sleep in this morning...  We were able to find Leo somewhere in NYC yesterday and after a fun breakfast catching up, we dragged his ass into the Birdcage and put him to work. As predicted and hoped for, Leo again left his mark on EXIT STRATEGIES. Let me be frank with you, I was handling problems in my other professional life, but Leo, at B's direction (Earn that producing credit, son!) did some sweet ass backing vocals for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. I had many ideas for backing vocals for this, but they went way out of my range (and believe me I tried), but Leo really came up with some great stuff that I think really punctuates the choruses significantly. While doing all this, Leo somehow fixed a recent font related problem in my computer, for which I am very very greatful, while giving me thousands of new fonts to play with!   We then gave Leo a playback of the song we wrote with him and Jamie Duffy, OUR FAITH, because he hadn't heard our changes. There weren't many other than my new vocals, so he he was really into it. He will be playing his own version of the song with his band, AM PACIFIC, at their upcoming shows in LA. You can't get a better compliment than that! After some Great Wall, we put a guitar in his hand. Brandt had wanted him to tackle LENINGRAD, but honestly I feel that song is truly developed, so, as mentioned in a previous entry, I knew we could do more to 1956, so we got him on the verses and boy did this turn out to be one of my better decisions. I won't give much away, but it's still getting further away from Primal Scream and closer and closer to Hypefactor. The effort is worth it, and like Charles before him, Leo now has opened new doors to this song that I think are going to make for an amazing final song. We're almost there with that track.  Thanks to Leo, always the pro, for coming in and really pushing our material forward again...  Later, I met back home with Irene for some Pluck U (which means she worked late and is too tired to fight me on the topic of dinner) and then had a few drinks with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, some of whom are quite sunburnt from extended sunbathing on either Long Island or Asia, depending on which poontanger you are speaking to. Congrats to Poontanger D on her new digs and the excellent drinks and kudos to whoever made the jello shots that Dan Hamill and Irene consumed like it was nobody's business.  From there we were off to see the Face, back in action. I think I missed a gig due to an LA visit, so I was psyched. I think I have mentioned my hatred of the venue, Sine-E, before, mostly because of their horrible technical problems. This time, the face were problem-free and the gig was another enjoyable experience. If anything, my dear comrade Mr. Peter is far too prolific for his own good. I feel like we're on album 5 when I don't even own album 1. Right when I get attached to a song, he goes and writes three more. My concern is that songs I loved a year or two ago will never see the light of day in my ipod. I know the album will own and don't get me wrong, the guy doesn't write a bad song. It's just we're 5 albums in when I still want albums 1-4. I love the man, I love his band, (and yes you SAW me singing along to the last song, Joe) and I say all this purely out of love for the music that I want to own. As a musician, I understand not wanting to be stuck playing the same songs over and over again, but songs like I LOVE YOU, MADLY and THERE IS A ROOM (which I'm certain has to be on the album) got you to the dance and got a lot of people in that venue last night. Give them the hits, lads, give them the hits!  We spent some time with the lads after the show. Peter, B and I discussed the HF album, and while he has his head around EXIST, melodically, CLEAN UP is a problem, so we are going to get Peterface into the Birdcage in July to work on it as a gang. I have now given him a deadline and he promises to stick to it. He's the last person we need to finish recording this album (No pressure, guy!).  Then at some randumb (intentional spelling) lower east side bar that seemed straight out of 1981, Dan Hamill didn't like the way a drunk man (with his thong exposed and shirt lifted) was treating one of our friends and he made this known. Dan Hamill is not an easy man to provoke so when I accidentally walked into this I just stood quietly backing him up while he defended the honour of our friend. I'm still not sure what this was all about, quite frankly. In fact, I am going to try to ask him to write something for the blog explaining, but he made quite an impact on this crew. After, one of the guys, obviously intimidated by my beard while backing up Dan Hamill, tried to sweet talk me, and I responded with 'As long as none of my friends are fucked with, you'll be ok'. After that, they went to the back of the bar so the guy in the thong could resume his dry humping of the two girls who were making out (yes we have photos). We have travelled all over the world with very few problems, or three ways so this is one for the books just to see Dan Hamill as Harrison Ford. I already respected that kid, but after last night, I respect him more.  The lovely day ended with a slize of pizza and garlic knots for my girl and I. As Leo and I sing in a song: Mas Bien.  +F         "
"             I'm leaving shortly to go to the studio to work with B and our special guest Leo V23, who is in town for a spell and has been roped into to add even more to this album (hopefully in the form of some sharp backing vocals). I'm psyched to have Leo on our turf for a change and I expect a productive day (once we stop talking about the genius of Cerati). Stay tuned.  In the meantime, last night, Irene and I checked out RUNNING ON KARMA starring my man Andy Lau and the beautiful Cecilla Cheung, at the 2004 New York Asian Film Festival. I might have discussed this film when I saw it some months ago (I'm a big fan), so the chance to see it on 35mm in a screening room was a must do for me. Irene had heard about it and had wanted to see it as well, so that got us to the theatre on time. Seeing a HK film on a movie screen in a movie theatre brought me back to my youth when I would sneak down to the Bowery (aged 10) to see whatever new movies were coming out of HK. Sadly there are no more Chinatown movie houses, so one must recapture their youth at these new kind of events. But the feeling was great. Go to the festival before this week is out. Some awesome movies are playing (like HERO and INFERNAL AFFAIRS). You can learn about at the Festival at http://www.subwaycinema.com/frames/nyaff04home.htm  Meanwhile, and I'm not sure why she bought this, while we were wandering about the upper west side the other night (don't tell anyone we were up there), Irene picked up the Ryan Adams CD LOVE IS HELL. Now, honestly, the guy seems to be a douche. When I first saw him, he was a douche singing in front of the Twin Towers and happened to grab some press because he filmed it before the Tradge (as it's called here). He's always in NME being, well a douche and because he lives nearby here, until recently I would see him quite a bit, quite often at the Gramercy, looking like, well, a douche, and usually with extremely funny but insane movie star girlfriend (who I hope is not a douche). He was recently photographed at my least favourite bar ever Black and White, which confirmed his huge douchedom. Also the cover of this album has two photos of himself, which makes it twice the necessary daily dose of doucheness.  I'm under the impression Irene bought this for Adams' cover of Mr. Gallagher's WONDERWALL, which is quite legendary if you read NME enough like I do. I'm told this CD is two EP's combined into one CD because his label, obviously douches, felt the material was 'too dark' to release as a full length. Well thats kinda wack because this CD is REALLY awesome. And the Oasis cover does live up to the NME hype. Yes it's dark, but his lyrics are solid and his melodies are sweet and I keep going back to the CD, no matter how many times I have the urge to listen to Ministry ;-)  Well, thumbs up for that douche at the Gramercy. The fucker can write some tunes. Lesson learned: look beyond on the douche and listen to the tunes. You'll be shocked what you hear.   Do that with Ass Cobra as well.  F          "
"             Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life, so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows. The fact of the matter is, as Irene put it, this was a 'reunion' show and no matter how much we loved this kind of stuff back in the day, and I was fortunate enough to see Puppy in 1992 (the best year ever), whatever we were about to see in 2004 just wasn't going to be the same thing. For some, like my significant other, this make the show skippable. For me, I can appreciate the challenge that was laying ahead for Mssrs. Key and Ogilvie.  Most of my interest in this was helped by the fact that the new album is really good. I respect their NOT going back and doing something they had done before (screw you diehards), so I expected them to do something different live. The quick comparison: Puppy was very performance art based in the old days, tons of props, big set, etc, which you could pull off back then without losing your shirt. in 2004, its impossible to pull off a big stage show, so the emphasis was focused on musical performance and to that effect, a guitarist/bassist was added as well as a drummer, while Mr. Key manned the keyboards. Honestly, I think that his moving from drums (he is amazing) to keyboards was perhaps the only true error of this tour. His style is unique and while I'm not knocking the drummer they had (he too was amazing), it did take away from their particular sound.  It seems I have spoken negative about this, but quite honestly, I had a blast, especially the first night. In an unusual move for me, I avoided reading about setlists, so I went into it all fresh. it was an open book for me. They played a great range of material spanning their whole career, including gems like GLASS HOUSES, TIN OMEN, TESTURE and INQUISITION, and other 'hits'. I was impressed by the way the music was presented and I thought the live versions, particularly of the olders stuff like SMOTHERED HOPE, were sharp without insulting the original versions. I would like to note that Ash marked out like a maniac at this gig, which is a big compliment. Also, we got TWO encores at this gig, which I'm told is very rare on this tour. By the time I left the first night, I was pumped to see it again.  The second night was interesting in that its like seeing a movie you really liked for the second time and you find things you like even more and now a few things you didnt like as much. But nothing I hated and I wasn't as excited as I was the first night, obviously, but it allowed me to appreciate the show more. I had heard from TODD RYAN (I spell his name in caps, so you can all yell at him), that Puppy had rehearsed 18 different set lists, but the set list was pretty much the same the second night. We stood in a different spot and got a better view than the night before, so it was fun to watch even more. Ogre's voice was much better the second night, and the music seemed tighter, but the crowd and the vibe was lacking the second night.   However, just when I was ready to get myself a drink, out of nowhere they brought out Grandpa Al to guest on TIN OMEN. It was 1992 (the best year ever) all over again. I don't think Al was plugged in, and he seemed quite zombified (and industrial Ozzy), but the idea of Al guesting with Puppy after all these years on a classic song he helped produce was enough for the crowd to lose their shit and for the 19 year old in me to flash a wide smile. It may not have been a classic performance, but it was certainly a classic moment. And in this day and age, a classic moment here and there with our old heroes is good enough...even if they look like theyre straight out of WEEKEND AT BERNIES.  F               "
"             first the 'sad' news...  http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story?id=6197868&pageid=rs.Home&pageregion=single1   next, skinny puppy was alright.  i didn't walk out with the shock and awe i was expecting or that i had seen before - but i also didn't walk out.  the guitarist/bassist guy - no complaints.  the drummer - no complaints.  cEVIN key - well, quite honestly he's fat, but he seemed appreciative of the crowd.  ogre - homeboy can't navigate his own costumes, but that's ok - he's canadian.  but on the whole, you spend two nights in NYC and you alter the set by one...two?...songs?!?!?!  sure we got some bonuses that most cities won't: smothered hope on the first night as an extra encore and Al 'i don't KNOW what to say about him' Jorgensen on 'guitar' for tin omen - i'll let someone else comment on that one...i'm left speechless.  but seriously, even the aggression would switch things up for gigs within a short time period (btw - i've heard they might be making a comeback). the techs for the band SUCKED as there were multiple occasions when ogre was left sans mic or mic stand or both.  and let's not even get into the crowd.  i give the first show a generous 3 out of 5 for the first night and a 2.5 for the second.  they highlight of last night was seeing the ESPN Radio dodgeball interviewer who remembers chatting with irene at length - like that's shocking ;)         "
"             I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch, and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing, one song, called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us. It's been through several arrangement changes, and everyone has had a feeling for sometime that this track was not quite there yet. So now, thanks to our newest addition Charles breathing new melodic life into the song by adding some new basslines, I was now ready to tackle Track 2 of the new Hypefactor album, which by the way, is the angriest, heaviest song HF has ever done, and will appeal to the few aggression fans who might pick this record up someday.  This song was intended to be our Primal Scream homage. And while it's still a nod to Booby G and co, I decided to loosen the reigns while molding this song into shape. Again, kudos to Charles for his solid work the other night. Because of him, I was able to blow this tune wide open. The track is very loop-based and repetative in nature, so I decided to go over all of these parts with a fine comb. Doing so, I found that these verses could be cut in half without losing the intensity of the song. Originally, the song opened with a quick POW, similar to the aggression's CHEMICAL SUN or Primal Scream's MISS LUCIFER, but after going through these loops, we found several loops and feedback guitar (and of course some of Charles' bass) that I loved and was able to turn these into a cool new intro . B and I agreed that the intro should remain loop based so when the song starts, the impact of the drums guitars will hopefully knock the listener on their ass. At least that is the intention.  During all this, Brandt's musical brain was working overtime and we tracked some new melodic guitars to put over the non-vocal verses. That nailed it as far as I was concerned.   And by the time it was over, 1956 had evolved into something new and exciting. It's in good enough shape for me to now lay down some vocals this coming week, but don't be surprised that once we have the vocals and live drums edited in that this song goes through another draft (mostly because there are so many loops that can probably be removed once Robin's drums are in). Not bad for a song that started 2 years ago with the aggression fooling around with laptops and guitars in my parents living room.  SPEAKING of the aggression, they will have a CD out in early 2005 featuring 14 (mostly unreleased) remixes from the course of their entire history. I'll get further into this as time progresses and details have emerged, but as Dan Hamill says 'Nostalgia is IN'. It is nice though to meet people who appreciate the aggression and their body of work and who want to hear more.  Keeping it old school I-Rock, The MOGpac at Skinny Puppy tomorrow and Monday, look for us. I'm the one with the beard (facial hair, not Ash)  F         "
"             Between an evening at the movies and a night in the studio, Thursday was a good day in MOGworld. This week I edited drum tracks for  Exit Strategies  about eight hours every day, so it felt really fucking liberating to do something  else  for one evening, even if sitting in front of a G4 PowerBook was still involved.  At last Saturday's dodgeball league tournament, the organizers were kind enough to give every team free passes to a screening of the new Ben Stiller/Vince Vaughn flick  Dodgeball . Vince is consistently fantastic, but Stiller is a hit-or-miss comedy writer (see  Envy ), so I was not expecting brilliance when I met FJ, Irene and her coworker at the Kips Bay Loews yesterday. And while this movie is not mediocre (though many will call it that), nor is it stunning (and a few may call it that), we laughed. A lot. Like  Zoolander , some gags were bizarre or simply did not make any sense. But the great material veers between brilliant one-liners ('You're as useful as poo-flavored lollipop!'), cruelty ('You were adopted. Your parents don't even love you.') and pottymouth laughs (a bar called The Dirty Sanchez), not to mention the nut-punching physical comedy. The non-sequitors and Mexican jokes also had us in stitches.  By the time FJ and I reached my block of Maiden Lane, Charles was already outside. We had planned a full band gathering at the studio yesterday, but Ash and Robin both bowed out for personal reasons. So rather than summit about the progress of  Exit Strategies  with everyone, we focused on three specific songs with Charles that needed bass overdubs or full-on rewrites. As the live drum edits came together for the record, we took the time to replay or completely refashion many instrumental takes recorded against drum loops. The recent addition of Charles to the hypefactor studio crew gave even FJ - typically reticent to re-record anything - impetus to erase a slew of old parts and start from scratch. In the case of the song 'Solar,' last night marked the third time we had revisted the song's bass part. On 'Exist' and 'Oneninefivesix,' early performances that we found somewhat lackluster were axed as well. We blew through the three songs quite quickly as Charles works at a steady pace and possesses a drum machine's sense of tempo, enabling us to keep takes to a minimum. There were some slow points during 'Solar' and 'Oneninefivesix,' although I chalk that up to the fact that Charles was exhausted and I was pushing him to both write  and  play long, seamless takes for both songs. A bit much for midnight on a Thursday, perhaps, but he pulled it off.  While the work we did last night may seem mundane, I cannot stress the significance of the evening enough in terms of improving band dynamic. FJ and Charles had never been in a room together under creative circumstances (as FJ missed the 'Descriptive' session in May for a Los Angeles trip), so it was important that they get a feel for each other (in a completely straight way.) By the end of the evening, FJ and Charles were avidly reminiscing about obscure 80s new wave (Nik Kershaw) and other 'stuff,' so all in all I would say it was a stellar session. Most importantly, Charles is smitten with the hypefactor material.  Plans tonight include !!! live at Bowery Ballroom, followed by another day in the studio tomorrow morning working on 'Oneninefivesix' with FJ. The sold out !!! gig will almost certainly be a hipster clusterfuck, so I can only hope the set will be worth it (and better than Out Hud.) But I would settle for a mediocre set with an indie celebrity sighting (like Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna moseying down West Fourth Street last Friday.)

"             Well, after months of anticipation, Irene and I were finally able to stay in town long enough to join MOG Athletics' Dodgeball Team for their second tournament. The whole experience was quite funny and enjoyable. It's an organized monthly tournament filled with a few hundred 20 and 30 somethings, all of whom take this game either quite seriously or in some cases, FAR too seriously. But believe me, those who took it far too seriously were heckled by the MOGpac and their cheerleaders, consisting of some of the ladies from Internationalpoontang.com. Most of the other teams were cool, but some were massive douches, but I guess in retrospect, it made it more fun to have heels to boo at (though people like the Douches of Rock, as I called them, reminded me way too much of why I never embraced the world of organized athletics or High School for that matter).  We had a solid (much better than I thought) and ethusiastic team, led by Matt, who is a focused and determined Captain and the man who scored our most dramatic victory. It was exciting to cheer him on as he claimed a huge victory when we he was outnumbered. It was easily the highlight of a very enjoyable day. Everyone played their hearts out and you can't ask for more than that. There were several times I was worried about Irene and Robin getting smacked around a bit (especially after hearing how robin was smashed in 'the womb' last time), but everyone ended the day in good shape (and with free passes to the see movie DODGEBALL this week).  This was followed by a fun afternoon of beer and food at some German place uptown and a nice long walk back home to Gramercy. Of course the evening was spent dead on the couch watching my newly purchased FREAKS AND GEEKS DVD. I remain in extreme pain as I type.  Meanwhile, in the musical world, a remix the aggression did for the band DUBOK, has surfaced on their website www.Dubok.net. There's a pro and con this. The pro is that something I have worked hard on is now available and is receiving some nice comments, and the con is that this EP (which features lots of remixes by a lot of great artists that you can also download) was supposed to be released by Tinman last year, with the aggression's remix EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS to follow it on the schedule.   In my heart of hearts, I kept hoping I would hear from Tinman asking them for the EP so we could get the last of the aggression's FLOOD-era material out. It might in fact be the last ever aggression release. There are some amazing remixes that have yet to be heard from artists all over the world who busted their asses at my request. It makes me look like an idiot to them and makes us look flakey to the few fans who have seen the EP teased on theaggression.com and Tinman's site (which hasnt been updated since last October) and want to buy it. I have tried repeatedly to contact Tinman to resolve this as well as to get copies of my records, in particular the first HF CD, of which we have no copies of. I know we're not a band thats sells many records, but the last thing I want to do is not be able to release something thats been advertised. More if and when I know.  I'm hearing good things about the Skinny Puppy tour, which member of the MOGpac will be attending here down the block from me one week from today. Some of us (like me) are going to both nights. I have a good feeling about this show.  And I'm wondering, does Brandt wear his dodgeball kneepads when he mixes?  F         "
"             Well, hipsters, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the Cure's travelling festival next month and if you see me there, you can thank Mattagement because thanks to a Ticketmaster screw up, the Internet Pre-Sale didn't start as scheduled and computer glitches made it EXTREMELY difficult for Dan Hamill and I to obtain our tickets this morning. Jokingly, I said to G 'If we don't have tickets in 5 minutes, I'm bringing Matt in', but then when I realized the situation wasn't improving, I, in fact, had to call in the trusty pal/manager. I was desparate. Matt, being Matt, once again brings good ticket karma to the table. As I conferenced called him and G on my cel while I rode through New York City in taxi cab on my way to the studio (normally, I take the subway, but I had to make myself available to the lads to get into my account to get the tix), Matt worked a miracle and was able to get the 4 tickets we needed for myself, Irene, G and Ash. Kudos to Matt, who's not even going to the gig (but he is seeing them in the South of France in a few weeks, so don't shed any tears for the fucker). This should be a good show. The Cure never disappoint and I haven't had a chance to see Interpol live, nor The Rapture. On the second stage, the music gods shine as Irene will finally get to see her beloved Muse and Dan Hamill will have the orgasmic time of his life experincing the hippy redheaded goodness that is Melissa Auf De Maur. And I'll laugh the whole time, I'm sure!  Anyhow, this ticket fiasco made me incredibly late for the studio, so we rushed right into the album's opening track, THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. This song was written well within my vocal range, but what happened since I did the scratch vocals is that Ash came in and re-wrote the bassline, thus changing the whole dynamic of the song. Also, this was my first time hearing Robin's live drums and they are nothing short of excellent!! She OWNS this album, but I needed to spend considerable time re-adjusting the vocal melodies to fit the new material. Of course, we got a better song out of it, but it took quite a while to do. I was able to get everything down eventually, but it took a lot of effort. However, I'm quite happy with the final result. I had a lot of ideas for backing vocals, but they are way out of my range, so we are contemplating bringing in a female vocalist. I also heard Brandt's new closing guitars and closing edit of DESCRIPTIVE, our new B-Side, and it's mega. We just need to get those verses in shape next. I did speak at length with Ash yesterday about this and 1956, so I think we're going to see the Factor Corp gathered together in the next week.   Luckily, I finished my work today in time to make it to lunch with famous comic book artist currently drawing a popular book with an 'X' in the title. We had a fun and productive 2 and a half hour lunch, and I really enjoyed my time with him. Plus he signed a copy of his latest hit for me! Speaking of comic books, the first issue of DC's big summer event book IDENTITY CRISIS, by bestselling author Brad Meltzer, came out today and it's pretty flipping amazing. This is a MUST READ. And since we're on the topic, big kudos to my friends at DC Comics for having the stroke of genius to create a DC Direct figure based on the old Earth-2 Robin. This is my dream toy and an wonderful, unexpected shocker. Can't wait for that!  And lastly on the can't wait front, thank you Mr. Lucas for allowing Cartoon Network to make a second season of CLONE WARS next year. Just don't screw up Episode 3, ok?  F         "
"             Obviously he's been too busy staring at the birds across the way, as Brandt, in his genius, totally skipped over our Memorial Day session at the studio, which was in fact the First Official Vocal Session (tm) of the album. Let's start with this: I love writing lyrics, I like coming up with melodies, but I hate singing. Hate it. If I had my way, HF would have its own singer, but the only man I feel to be worthy enough to be the HF frontman has his own band to worry about, but he occasionally graces us with a vocal or two when it counts. You may have read about him here before.   In the aggression, it was easier because you could get away with not being perfect because we would just slap distortion over it. Hypefactor, fortunately (or unfortunately) is different. Doing vocals with Brandt is a much different experience than working with Tom and Ash on FLOOD. Quite honestly, while I love the lads, recording the vocals for FLOOD with those two mo's was a horrible and frustating experience as they kept forcing on me what they wanted as opposed to making the most out of what I am capable of doing vocally (which isn't much to begin with, but hey, you try it).   Brandt, while often a slow-mo, has the know-how to get the best performance out of me. He understands my range and what I can and can't do. What I learned from the last HF CD was that I work best demoing my scratch vocals and then listening to them for a month or so before coming in to record the final tracks. This approach also helps me in places where I feel the lyrics might be weak. I always carry my little lyric book with me to jot down revisions, so when the time comes to record the final vox, I'm ready to go.  One final thing I thought was important to this process was my desire to record my vox against the real drums recorded for the album. Brandt has been editing the drums in bits and pieces, so if something had a real drum edited together, I focused on those first. I felt having the real drums to sing against would create the right emotion for each song as opposed to singing to loops. This went out the door somewhat when I started getting into the groove of things but lets see what happens when the drums are all in there.  Because a lot of prep has gone into the vocals BEFORE I step into Brandt's bathroom to record, we're able to hit the ground running and this past Monday was no exception. We started with CREATION PHASE, and were able to wrap that up very quickly over several hours. Brandt would record several tracks of me recording different things in different ways so we had the pick of the litter later on when mixing. With this track we had the new ending that Ash, B and I wrote and I was able to come up with something on the fly to add to ending. It's a short vocal passage, but perfect in terms of the song coming to it's conclusion. This one is a stormer.   After a long tea and biscuit break, We then tackled SOLAR, the album closer. This had partial drums but I got caught up in the song, so we laid down the whole song over the course of a few hours. Again the same approach of recording several different takes was applied. Also note, Brandt is a stickler for detail. If I fucked up a nuance of a vocal, I was ordered (in a nice way) to re-take it. This kid is determined to make this album as live and as real as possible and I think he just doesnt want to have sit and play with auto-tune for a month. Needless to say, i did my best and he didnt argue or make fun of me too much, though he keeps telling me to sing 'More Gay' on the mushier songs like SOLAR.  Feeling the vibe, I asked him to roll THEME FROM PROPAGANDA, which isnt a song as much as it is the dance ceterpiece of the album. I originally wanted to leave it alone, but I had an idea to take an Undeworld-y approach to it, so we put a lof of effects on the vocal and I just improvd a bunch of random lyrics about clubs, coat checks, and assorted random BS that you hopefully not be able to make out when you hear the final song. I'm not sure what I did here, and I don't think B did either, but hey.  So we're off to a good start. B has already filled you in on our Spanish Language Experience (tm), which was scary and fun. Luckily, Leo did all the hard work in advance, so I just had to make sure I was pronouncing everything properly. This is a lot harder than it sounds, kids. Anyway, I'm very high on this track, OUR FAITH, and the album itself here in the late stages is evolving into something better than what I thought it could be a month ago.  There is still more work to be done, but luckily my next two songs, THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, and ONE.NINE.FIVE.SIX are currently in the very capable musical hands of Brandt and Charles, respectively. Until they do their things on those tracks, I can't cut my vocals for those tracks, and I don't want to be in a position where I do vocals and then someone alters something musically in the song. In the meantime, I have to finish lyrics and verse melodies for DESCRIPTIVE. This will keep me occupied as I'm trying a whole new approach (for me) to lyric writing and vocal recording with this song. Brandt touches on it below, but I'll get further into it later on.  Special thanks to my man Bisquit for sending me the studio version of RevCo's CATTLE GRIND (hilarious)!  F           "
"             I almost forgot to mention...  In non-hypefactor news, a recent Guardian newspaper interview with Scotch charmer Kelly MacDonald included some wonderful news for fans of British drama (such as myself). The BBC ordered a second season of  State Of Play , a six-part series about investigative reporters and political corruption in modern-day London that debuted in the States last month. While substantially shorter than MOG favorite  24  - it is customary for a British TV season to run a mere eight or nine episodes - the two shows share a great deal in terms of pacing (relentless action, frantic dialog, radical camera cuts, heart palpatations.) In the first season, the i-team tied a government researcher's murder and a drug shooting to an energy scandal in the British parliament, with plenty of unexpected twists. Admittedly no arms were severed in the making of the series, but this program can effortlessly hold a candle to  24  or any other mystery-action show.  Need more convincing? The original cast, most of whom are tipped to return, includes MacDonald, John Simm (Bernard Sumner in  24-Hour Party People , a raver in  Human Traffic ) and Bill Nighy (the aging rock star in  Love Actually ), among countless others. And MacDonald, despite being married to a twit who plays bass in Travis, is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the BBC is rubbish when it comes to issuing DVDs in a timely fashion, and the first season of  State Of Play  is no exception: The Beeb's Web site lists a release date in February 2005. I hope, however, that BBC America will run the series a few more times in the interim for those who missed MacDonald's gorgeous accent. And the other stuff, of course.         "
"             For the second post in a row the MOGpac heads south of the border. The circumstances: FJ and I booked another 10 a.m. session at BIrdcage on Wednesday to continue work on vocals. The day was unique, however, in that we decided to tackle a vocal track for the song 'Our Faith.' Which, as it happens, is sung entirely in Spanish... a language that neither FJ nor I speak.  The backstory in 100 words or less: I demoed in the song in the fall of last year, then FJ came and re-arranged it. Jamie Duffy of Acumen Nation/DJ? Acucrack/Chemlab stopped in the studio and added guitars, followed by another few months of writing/arranging. Then, in March, we mailed the computer files for the song to Leo Canneto (Virus 23/AM Pacific), who recorded more guitars and a Spanish lead vocal while FJ visited him in Los Angeles. A Gustavo Cerati homage, basically, and a damn good one at that.  While FJ knew he wanted the song to be a duet of sorts, he came to the studio with no real arrangement game plan yesterday. One idea floated earlier was to mix Leo's Spanish vocal with FJ singing in English. But after listening to the track on loop for about an hour, we realized that altering or eliminating any significant part of Leo's vocal to accomodate FJ was, well, pretty fucking stupid. It is a brilliant vocal, so why fuck with it? But in keeping with the duet plan, FJ saddled himself with the challenge of learning Leo's vocal in Spanish and doubling it. And he rose to the occasion, I must say, as he hammered the song out word-for-word over the course of a couple hours. One of his strongest deliveries yet.  We also found the time to track a rough vocal for a chorus of 'Descriptive' yesterday, marking the first time we have ever recorded a vocal so early in a song's gestation. There is not much to write yet because the song is far from complete, but I think the final version of this particular vocal will be one of the finest performances FJ ever commits to tape. I predict that will be a difficult session, however, as the tune requires a delicate croon unlike most anything recorded by either hypefactor or The Aggression. More on how this plays out once we have the verse figured out...  Aside from the vocals, I have been putting in a lot of hours at the studio editing drums and trying to keep the album on schedule. 'The Morning After The Life Before' is the priority song right now; we recorded a slew of guitar and bass overdubs in late April and early May, and we want to wrap up the vocals within a week. Once the live drums are mixed with some programmed rhythms (courtesy of Ash's wonderful TR-909 and, perhaps, Robin Emmet), this song will be a monster worthy of comparison to recorded music's best album openers. Modesty? Not in this case.  Also near the front of the editing line is 'One.nine.five.six,' the aborted song we recovered from The Aggression's final demo sessions. A vocal session for that tune will have to wait, however, as FJ and I agreed earlier in the week that Charles should be invited to re-write and re-track the bass line. While FJ and I have been on the same page from day one about what the song  should  be ( Exterminator  and  Evil Heat -era Primal Scream, mostly), we both seemed to have reservations about our instrumental execution. In an effort to breathe some new life into our thinking, we gave Charles a wide berth in terms of what he can write and record, and I hope his ideas will allow us to revisit the guitar and vocal melodies later this month. If his performance on 'Descriptive' is any indication, Charles' playing will properly anchor the song, and that is exactly what it needs.  And now for a non-sequitor: While the Birdcage studio (aka my apartment) has three rooms, most of the recording takes place in a room tucked in the northeast corner (as it is farthest away from my fifth-floor neighbors and, therefore, less noisy.) This is also the only room with a clear view of neighboring apartments, as it abuts directly on two other buildings. Lately, the view from my mixing desk has been getting more and more Cinemax. About two months ago, my distant neighbors decided to eat dinner in their lingerie. Last week, the people whose kitchen window looks out on the studio had some sort of professional photo shoot in their space, replete with many shirtless men. And last night, in a moment that would have thrilled Ash, I sat editing drums while a girl in the same kitchen walked around for ten minutes... topless. Now who said studio work was boring?         "
"             If you weren't at Rothko's on Friday night, you missed it, meng.  I caught my first (and rare, for a NYer) glimpse of what would have been the result if Stephen Patrick Morrissey had been born in Tijuana instead of Manchester.  This well-coifed man is Jose Maldonado, on loan from LA's Sweet and Tender Hooligans.  He's got the hair, he's got the specs, he's got the cuffed jeans, he's got the cardigan, the paisley paisley shirt (i think it was paisley), the malnourished yet amorphic physique - but more than anything else, he's got the voice and the on-stage disposition and relationship with the audience that truly captures his idol's mystery.  much unlike the fag (oh btw the douche - NO ONE LIKES YOU) that used to head up the Salford Lads (btw, guitarist John 'Johnny' Capp if you're reading this - how's RVC, pally?), Jose possesses class.  ash and i walked out on a Lads gig 4+ years ago at Don Hill's because the fagsinger was such a (coining G) nightmare.  back to the gig - kicking it off with the Queen is Dead, a few forgotten lyrics are quickly forgotten as he belts out the outro 'life is very long when your lonely', the set consisted of standard Moz and Smiths tunes including Shoplifters (sent out to Winona Ryder), Last of the Famous..., Girlfriend in a Coma, November Spawned a Monster and This Charming Man.  The Lads even assembled a great rendition of First of the Gang to Die off the new one.  All in all, SummerMan, my recently legalized S.O. and her teacher friend were all thoroughly impressed by the performance.  did i mention the four go's right in front of brandt and me that led us to make a pact to never smith smiths/moz tunes to each other?  i'll let him tell you about those guys.  i'll leave you with a post i left on the Sweet and Tender Hooligans yahoo group in true fan appreciation...  hey all -  brand new to the group and i joined just to say thanks to Jose for making the trip out here - your performance was jaw-on-the-floor amazing. the last time i caught the Lads i WALKED OUT because the old lead singer was so terrible - in talent and personality - but that's neither here nor there.  i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to catch up with you, but i expressed my appreciation to both ez and brian, the promoter. you kids in LA are damn lucky to have this guy as i'm sure you are aware!  hope to see you out east again sometime soon. cheers. matt.  JOSE MALDONADO REPLIES: Thanks for that, Matt. Sweet and Tender Hooligans played at The Knitting Factory New York last October and hope to return very soon. I was real happy to come back and visit The Big Apple again and I'll more than likely be back to run the marathon. Hmm.. maybe I can work a gig around that..?    PS - someone had to respond to me...  From:  'Jeremy Alisauskas'    Date:  Mon May 31, 2004  4:43 am Subject:  Re: [Sweet and Tender Hooligans] NYC gig...  How very cruel of you sir!  Terrible in talent and personality? well if you walked out than you certainly didn't speak with him, so how may I ask do you know anything about his personality?  Thats just a nasty thing to say, and being nasty doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look insecure.  Goodnight Sir!    AND I SAY THIS TO YOU MR. JEREMY ALISAUSKAS...being a dick-sucking homo doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look GAY! \ / Sir!         "
"             There is literally never a moment of rest this month as I woke up at 4am, got on a 7am plane, flew to NY, walked in the door, kissed Irene hello, ate some Pluck and then ran off to see Saintface in Brooklyn at my favourite venue Southpaw. The band were in TOP form and played with a lot of energy and the sharp musicianship I come to expect from these lads. Also, they played some more of the hits, including my two current favourite songs, which proves this very blog has some sway. And yes, that's been confirmed. Anyhow, the gig was REALLY good, they were firey and had the swagger of a band that is confident and excited about playing music. I love that. Also, Peter pulled an old school Frank move by dedicating the last song to one of his many ex-wives, which to me is always a genius move, so respect to him to that. Of course said ex wife was one of the ladies of internationalpoontang.com, which made it all the more enjoyable.  Normally, this is where I would start bitching about their album, yadda yadda, but Peter has two days left of actual mixing. I told him I would be on his doorstep Wed morning ;-) I expect big things from this album and I doubt I will be disappointed. And you know it will be reviewed here first.  Speaking of reviews, a ton of CD's have showed up here in my absence that have yet to be consumed, such as the new Damage Manual Remixes, Pigfaces' crackhead (I love getting things early), the Cracknation Sampler (thanks El!), and two CD's by Gustavo Cerati's bandmate/programmer Leandro Fresco, who is AWESOME. Lots to listen to, but not enough time as our day will be spent on Randall's Island checking out the Curiosa Festival. To say Irene is psyched to see Muse would be like saying I am a casual Star Wars fan.  F.         "
"             i've been in this city for an hour, and already i've seen:   1 transexual - pre or post-op, i can't confirm - we didn't get a chance to chat about it  2 asian men speaking french - which is one of the few things that freaks me out as much as midgets  3 homeless men  4 americans  and tons of rack!!!&nbsp; not necessarily exposed, but still there.&nbsp; the only things for me now that would complete my trip are my boyfriend (ashley)who appreciate the rack, my girlfriend (who would appreciate the rack as much as ash or me)&nbsp;and my luggage, which some french fuck forgot to put on my flight from paris to nice.&nbsp; you's think that since these fags aren't spending any money or man power in the mid-east that they'd at least get the whole 'take the bag from this plane and put it on that plane down'.&nbsp; HOWEVER - me being the winner that i am, my suitcase has already been checked onto the next flight down which arrives at 5pm local time (it's 1115am now) which means that since my baggage is more than three hours late and i bought my plane tickets thru AMEX, i get some sort of make-good in the form of $$$ :)&nbsp; happy, but to say that i can't wait to kick it former-eastern-bloc-turned-genocidal-dictatorship tomorrow in croatia is an understatement.&nbsp; fuck the eu.   i've been up for a full 24hours now, so as soon as my hotel room is ready i aim to sleep.   i wish my friends well and i'll check in with updates of uncharted lands soon.  NOTE TO FRANK: since you're into taking advice from the 5yo, what are his thoughts on REVENGE OF THE GAY?          "
"             My nephew, Cameron J. Bradish, informs me that we must never, EVER talk to the Mondu, which is a korean dumpling that Irene's mom makes that is blow away the best dumpling I have ever had. However, we're not allowed to talk to the Mondu, especially when we are eating it. I trust this 5 year old, so I will proceed to eat said Mondu and never EVER speak to it. I wanted this on record.  F          "
"             My LA trip is taking its toll, but it does allow me a few fun moments. Took a quick pit stop in to see the nephew, who is recovering from dental surgery, which could suck for a 5 year old, but some Yu Gi Oh swag can be super medicine. Also, ran into young assistant friend of Agent/Lawyer/Advisor who wants to quit the biz to play guitar. Good seeing him, but too brief. We have a tentative plan to meet at The Short Stop, owned by one Greg Dulli, later this week, but I have a feeling I'm gonna get swamped and have to cancel, which sucks.   I was able to end the evening on a high note for two reasons:  Firstly, Dr. Fury himself, the original aggression vocalist turned screenwriter, was in town and we were able to catch up at Ca'brea, which thank fuck, is still open and in fact being renovated. The sweetie who runs the place gave me the full report on the renovations and made me feel like I own the place. Fury and I discussed his recent adventures in Alaska as well as our respective businesses. He is often eager to hear of my musical adventures as I feel he secretly longs to be in music again. I think. Don't tell him I said, but tell him I DO appreciate him treating.  Nextly, I return to LA HQ to find a nice surprise in my E-box: an mp3 of Mr. Peter Saintface's vocal demo for the new HF song EXIST. I've had it on repeat repeatedly for some time and I am VERY VERY happy. He doesn't know this yet, but I love it and am quite happy. It's quite Depeche in nature. This is a very good thing. As always, Mr. Face was worth the wait and he gets a free drink from me when I hopefully see them back in NY on Friday night. I havent heard from Brandt on this song yet as he is in Chicago with family, but I have a feeling he will be pleased as well. More on this soon.  F         "
"             The con was THIS close to a full success, mostly because I got screwed big time out of the convention only Batman figure. Lost the raffle every day. I suck. However, I scored a rare new BATMAN BEYOND Kubrick as well as a convention Teen Titans special Robin Mini Figure. I type this yet again in my SITH t-shirt, so the 2004 con will go down as the best so far.  So now its back to LA for the week until the Cure gig Saturday. I'm going to try and catch Saintface in Bklyn on Friday night if I am awake (Hello, Peter!). Not much to report here other than a brief but enjoyable phone conversation with Mr Pally Neet, who is in Albany being visited at the moment by Agent/Advisor/lawyer, who's room I type this from. My chat with Dan was a nice surprise and uplifiting. He is a good vibe. I hope to get my grubby Machine Rock hands on their new material sooner than later...probably before Die Warzau if they keep delaying!  Yes, I was seen at Skybar today, but I'm not proud of doing such LA things. Yes, I did make up for it by watching the awesome Iron Man match on Raw while eating Pizza. However, because former students turned pals have Direct we actually watched WWE on East Coast time, which has totally thrown me off. With Wrestling done at 8pm, I have no idea what to do with myself. Thus I am writing to you.  I had a brief scare on Sunday when Mrs. Cramp (and unborn child) attempted to eat at my favourite LA eatery, Ca'brea, last night and found it was closed. I panicked big time, but called tonight and they answered, so maybe they are just closed on Sunday in the summer. I hope. I will try to make it there tomorrow night with former aggression vocalist turned screenwriter turned parent. I'll keep you posted.  Back home, Irene informs me that Inv has sent some CD's. I think the Damage Manual remixes are in there, which is an interesting album to me. As you know, I adore my friend Connelly, but I felt the Damage Manual fell short, mostly because I thought the production wasn't up to snuff. The CD's sounded muddy (no pun intended, Neet) and failed to grab me like Murder Inc. did several years before.  The lackluster show Brandt and I saw them play years ago didn't help either. However, hearing remixes could allow the project to take on a new meaning for me. Ill keep you posted. It's a shame Chemlab doesnt have a remix album out...we know who to thank for that, i think.  Meanwhile, the UK trip gets even better, as Irene and I will be seeing Mr. Greg FUCKING Dulli himself and his Twilght Singers the day we get there. I will stay sober for this gig, I promise. Unless G shows, which isnt likely. I just got the tix and I am dead psyched, kids.  Hope you like the new Blog look. I had no idea I had OPTIONS, so I looked into it...           "
"             The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged. I won't bore you with my true reasons for being here, thats part of my OTHER life, but I will tell you that it is exciting and exhausting to the extreme. I wouldn't trade the opportunity to be here for anything, its that much fun!  First off: Irene is down in DC, but is a winner here in SD as I have not only gotten her a rare NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS item (Kubrick related, of course) but she about to be the proud owner of a personally autographed lithograph by her fave artist, Mr. Michael Turner. I don't know Mr. Turner very well, but I appreciate his going to the extra step to personalize the autograph for my significant other. I think she's gonna be happy...  While working as well as searching for gifts for the nephew, cousin, and girlfriend, I took the opportunity, as I do every year here, to make some time for myself and attend the annual STAR WARS presentation along with 6,999 other people. This is always a highlight, especially when there is a new movie on the horizon. I'll skip over the details, you can always find them on the SW website, but being there for the first announcement of the new movie title, REVENGE OF THE SITH, at the end of the presentation, was something special for a diehard like myself. However, this is just where the fun begins...  Immediately after announcing said title, Steve Sansweet, the Lucas 'guy' who gives these presentations, displayed a new tshirt with the new movie title/logo on it and announced the shirt would be onsale in 'Five minutes at the Star Wars Pavillion' (which is huge, fyi). Well, you dont say that kinda of thing to 7,000 insane fans, who all then RAN, and I mean RAN to get the tshirt. I didnt rush as I had calls to return, but when I made it to the line, there were literally THOUSANDS of people in front of me. In fact, Con security had to cut the line for safety reasons and of course, I was part of the line that was cut. RRRRR.  Frustrated, I went on my way, not realizing I was walking past the back of the pavillion where said shirts were being sold. The securtiy people were so busy forcing people against the wall that they basically left the SW salespeople/cash registered unblocked, so yours truly had no problem walking RIGHT UP and buying a tshirt within 3 minutes and before they even let anyone get there!! In my perverted mind, I am the first person to ever buy a REVENGE shirt, but I know its not true, but ALLOW me the moment, ok? I got lucky here and was so scared that they were gonna bust me that I ran off as soon as I purchased the shirt. Within seconds, someone from Lucasfilm had grabbed me. I was ready to give the shirt back, but it was actually the girl working the register giving me my change!! I was so excited that I split before getting my money. While I am a sith badass for cutting thousands of people on line, she would make an honorable jedi for bringing me my change. Cheers to Lucascashregisterchick.  My other highlight of the evening: While on my way to dinner with a wonderful TV actress who I grew up watching and having a major crush on, I was stung by a bee for the first time in my life. It SUCKED. I don't recommend it. Especially when dining with TV stars. However, it was a great conversation piece, especially when putting a bag of ice on my swelling neck. Fortunately, no allergic reaction. Yet. Pray.  So its back to the Con for a bit tomorrow, then off to LA again for the week. I'm tired, but I have seen the wookie planet and thats enough to make me happy and sleep well.   Goodnight, all!  F           "
"             Despite not being here for a few months, California is just how I left it: Sunny, hot, and filled with the usual suspects. I flew into town early to check out the rough cut of a certain movie that I am associated with that stars The One and current favourite actress who irene hates who lives near MOGworld despite being from accross the pond. I'm happy to say after 8 years, this movie has been worth it as it is great and you will hopefully all see it early 05.  The sweet irony of it was that the next day, while sipping tea at the Four Seasons at a table next to kevin Spacey (who has a very large head, yet is more handsome in person than you would think), the same current favourite actress came walking in looking nothing short of amazing and justifying my longtime love of her. Cheers, Ms. W.  I was only in LA briefly this week, sharing my time only with my lawyer/agent/advisor (now en route to NY) and cool as hell nephew who is the best. Thanks to Irene's moms for yet ANOTHER great meal. Cheers, Mama Bradish.  I'm now in San Diego for ComicCon and it is quite frankly overwhelming. Its too big, but the Star Wars stuff is great this year and I type while wearing my new Original Trilogy tshirt. God somehow blessed me that I can live with a hot chick, put out records, and make movies while being a HUGE geek of epic proportions. And no, despite what some may tell you, I am not dressed like Han Solo for the convention.  Being here at the moment puts my musical life on hold, but my art career is taking off. I have been asked by a new band (featuring ex members of my favourite all time industrial rock band) to create the new logo and look for the unit. I am excited about the challenge, so cheers to Ash and Ass Cobra!  Ill try and write back regarding the con, but quite honestly, its going to kick my ass until I head back to LA on Sunday morning. I will then be in NYC for only a few weeks before Irene and I FINALLY make our way to Europe for the long awaited vacation. We will hit the UK and pay a visit to the French. We will be lazy and eat well and see Primal Scream with the Louches. This is a good life, kids.   In the meantime, if youre in SD, say hello and come visit me at the Warners presentation tomorrow. i think you can figure out which presentation Ill be at with bells on.   Also, for you Hollywood types, read VARIETY today and you might see yours truly mentioned there.  F         "
"             Since all is quiet due to MOGtravel, let me throw in a quick note about the Prince show I attended on Monday, 7/12.  Two words: UN-real.&nbsp; The man has been doing it for 25 years and he hasn't lost a nanogram of it.&nbsp; Prince is a pure entertainer and a damn fine one at that.&nbsp; He got the entire crowd into the show; so much so that even this writer caught himself clapping along once or twice (this as opposed to the standard folded arms with the 'try to impress me' smugness on the face).  For a capacity crowd at the World's Most Famous Arena, Prince delivered hard.&nbsp; He played the hits, he played the old school, he played the hits and the old school on a stool with an acoustic guitar.  You could he missed the big shows.&nbsp; When he went into exile during the 'slave' years due to fights with Warner Bros, he'd play epics sets in tiny European clubs - that's well and good but someone of his caliber belongs on the big stage - he feeds off of it.&nbsp; The louder the crowd got, the more intense he got.&nbsp; No one walked out of the show feeling in anyway disappointed (except for my sister who wanted to hear '1999' - I tried to explain to her that since we've passed the year 1999, that it was kind of a moot point) - and good thing too since the tickets weren't exactly price like an all ages Fugazi gig.  Prince, as expected, brought with him a stellar band.&nbsp; No, Sheila E was not there, but the 'precussionist', to his credit was outstanding.&nbsp; Prince also had one guitarist, bassist - both superb - two saxomaphonists - one of whom used to play with James Brown or something like that - a trumboner, and two keyboardists.&nbsp; All geniuses at their trade.&nbsp; And not to be out done, Prince can wail on the guitar.&nbsp; All the virtuoso rumors I had heard are TOTALLY valid.&nbsp; He started out with his traditional telecaster and eventually ended up with his signature swirly-glyph looking guitar.  I was truly happy I experienced this - and, to boot, everyone who walked in the building received a copy of his new album.&nbsp; That's full-service stardom.          "
"             Well, the above phrase was uttered by MOGpac Athletics team captain Matt after the Pac lost a crucial dodgeball match to the tournaments first ever (at least from what I've seen) All-Girl team, and I think that sums up last nights D-ball performance. We managed to win one, but we suffered nothing but losses the entire evening.  About this loss to women, I put the blame squarely on the shoulders of G, The Kidd, and our newest player, the utterly useless (yet enjoyable to have around) Lurch, who saw this match as an opportunity to 'play nice' and meet some girls. Since our team has girls, one of which is my own girlfriend, I felt no need to pull punches and eliminated several girls without mercy (and without injury). Matt I dont have to worry about as he doesn't respect women, Brandt, who played sleeveless and will never hear the end of it, is so young that he is still in his 'girls are yucky' phase, and Irene and Robin ARE girls. My other three mates, however, we're thinking with their willies and we were served up a big hulking plate of defeat. THANKS GUYS. Of course I mean this all in good fun.  However, I must say, I had a ton of fun, even though weeknight dodgeball can be quite tiring as opposed to Saturday Mornings, in which you are rested and raring to go. I played all right, I guess. I think I played better than last time, but I was the victim of several bad calls and even got hot under the collar at one point with the ref, which is very unlike me (i was proven right though and allowed back). As a protest, I have decided to be the Brock Lesnar of D-ball and retire at the tender age of 31 to possibly return to my backyard wrestling career. If the money is right, I might return to D-ball, even though it has become a corporate monster of camera crews and Red Bull endorsements. I am about the GAME, the SPORT of Dodgeball.  Special thanks to Pete and Damon for no-showing at the last minute, leaving us short. Cheers, bastards. Also special thanks to G who brought the driest, least chewy, Chewy Granola bars ever. Asshole!  Anyhow, the night before was spent partially at the Birdcage, with me in the producers chair recording Brandt's new rythmn guitars for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, which had to be changed in light of Charle's recent bass revisions. B worked fast and with great skill and the night breezed by. I was only there a few hours, but left a very happy producer knowing that the opening track of the album will have the kick I want it to have. Brandt also threw in a few new brushstrokes which brought later parts of the song to life. Well played, guy.  B also posted the new version of 1956 for the others to hear and while we havent heard from Ash about it, Charles really was into it. In some instances, he couldnt tell the difference between his basslines and my new basslines, which to me is a HUGE compliment! We might get him to tweak some of his bass because I used different drums in certain places now in the song and he feels he could tighten his stuff up. Bring it on, I say.  I'm leaving for LA on Tuesday and B is off to Europa for a long spell on the 24th, but we're in super shape. The only thread dangling is Peter Saintface, who is mixing like a madman for S-face. We're patient people and he is worth waiting for as we have plenty to do. He's gonna sing two songs and is going to be the exclamation point on this album. To answer some of your E-mails, I have no idea when this record is coming out. Honestly, this is a new band starting basically from scratch and this album is crucial in defining who and what this band is and thus, it has to be perfect to us before you can hear. I love this record and won't sell it short, but damn am I itching to play some gigs with these people!  Tidbits: IDENTITY CRISIS might be the best comic book mini-series since KINGDOM COME. Congrats to my pal Mr. Carlin on editing a potential masterpiece...I just wrapped up Ric Flair's autobiography, which is wonderful, funny and educational when it comes to a business that I love, but have very little knowledge of. Foley's books are a tad better, but this comes close...I count the seconds until new record label PULSEBLACK gets up and running. It's the Die Warzau guys and all of their projects and I'm expecting huge things from them. The new DW songs are amazing...  I'm sure there's more, but the day must begin!  F         "
"             First off, I just love the above title which is a quote from a description of the new Jackie Chan movie NEW POLICE STORY. My love of Jackie and his work is no secret to anyone, especially my lovely significant other who has to wake up every day to a wall of framed movie posters and photos and JC and me. Anyhow, I love the trailer for this new movie, so I'm hoping it's good. JC has supposedly decided to go back to HK and just make movies there for a few years. I can't say I disagree. When I'm not rushing to see his latest Hollywood work, we have a problem. It's ok JC, you made your millions, just do what you do best...  Speaking of doing what you do best, I found myself back at the Birdcage this weekend working again on problem-song 1956. We've got the musical part of the song in great shape, so now it was time for the next step. I had the lyrics and the vocal melody all ready to go and upon my first delivery, Brandt felt quite frankly that the approach was flat and needed more. Weeks of work down the drain in 10 seconds. However, it was the kick in the ass I needed because we sat there for quite awhile going through the track line by line and after a relatively short time, we had a new vocal melody cooking. Once I nailed the first verse, the rest of the song just poured out of me. It was a weird night and day experience in the studio, as I felt quite stymied early on and then suddenly, as if someone had flicked a switch, I was able to figure this song out with little trouble.  The other positive that came out of it was that while using a guitar to figure out certain notes for me to sing in the newer parts of the song Brandt, unbeknownst to himself, had written a new guitar part for the bridge. I convinced him to play what he was initially playing to figure out my vocal melody as a new solo. I then went and wrote a new vocal for the part and we had an even BETTER song.   And with this, and I'm probably jinxing myself here, my recorded contributions to EXIT STRATEGIES have come to a close. All that is left is one P. Saintface coming in to the studio to make some vocal magic happen. More on that soon...I hope.  With all of my musical work accomplished, I spent the later portion of the day/early evening with an assembled MOGpac at the annual German fest back home on the Island. Last year was a drunken mess of light and dark beers, sausage and potato pancakes. This year was a more reserved affair as we all got there much later, and we were all exhausted from our various musical projects (the Cobras had worked on tunes till 4:30am the night before and THEN rehearsed, which is a work ethic I can admire). Though brief, seeing the crew is always worth it.  Yesterday, Irene and I tried to sleep in, but there's just always something going on that keeps us from sitting still (In fact, I couldn't even get time to watch the WWE PPV till 1am last night). We checked out the off-Broadway show COOKIN', which is really good in a STOMP kinda way, but this time with Asian cooking. It made us quite hungry, so we immediately ate like champs. Of course, it was no rest of the weary as I spent the rest of my night with Country Music's finest, THE NASHVILLE ATTITUDE, fronted by my talented cousin Marc Vincent, who writes better original music than the covers he plays.   I'm catching up big time on recent music, but I'm too swamped too go in depth. But quickly: I'm shocked at how much I hate the new Prodigy album. I like the new Interpol, but felt it was too much of the same thing and they played it too safe. However, more tracks from the new Die Warzau album have emerged and I'm loving everything I'm hearing so far. That album has a lot of potential! Also, has anyone heard the new Clay People song FAILURE? It's a remix, but I like it. Mr. Neet, like Jimmy Marcus, remains one of the best singers ever in the genre and along with Jared, one of the best lyricists. No one can touch those two. Anyhow, the new Clay song reminds me of recent Chemlab. Funny, innit?  Little time, little sleep, but nothing to complain about, kids.  F         "
"             Starting with this post, I will start a new section of this blog entitled 'What I've Learned From...' in which when I feel I have learned something for better or for worse from someone. I will relay this to help you as the reader learn from our experiences here in MOGworld. These entries will appear when necessary.   The very first entry is: 'What I've learned from Mike 'The Kidd' Hess'  I have learned to never go into bars my siblings frequent and try to namedrop them when my friends and I can't get served because we are drunken douches. And if you want to get kicked out of said bar (the best pub in NYC) just say to the bartender: 'BUT I'M IN THE AGGRESSION!'  This does not work. You have been learned.  F           "
"             Beat from what seems like a week of non stop insanity, I will try to recollect the past few days to the best of my abilities.  First off, SPIDERMAN 2 was nothing short of excellent. I don't think it's any secret that I love the first hour of the original film and hate the second hour of bad CGI, plot holes the size of mars, and bad pacing. For me, and as some of you know, comic book movies are my 'thing', and I can find very little I didn't like about SPIDEY 2. Every huge problem I had with the first movie, some of which are listed about, was addressed and it seems Sony has lifted the shackles off of Mr. Raimi and have allowed him to make not just a great superhero movie, but a great Sam Raimi film. A lot of the the quirkiness of his earlier work shines through here, and don't even get me started on the awesome Bruce Campbell cameo. Anyway, see it. Repeatedly.   As planned, the entire crew got together Thursday night for a long listening/commentary session on the current status of EXIT STRATEGIES. Well, they got half of the record, really, but mostly the stuff that have made leaps and bounds in recent weeks. Of everything, OUR FAITH, received an overhwelming thumbs up from the group as did all of Charles' recent contributions. Thats not to say everything was peachy keen. Charles and Ash (and occasionally poor Robin, who I think was asleep most of the time) had a lot to say, and luckily in our grown up post-aggression drama years, their comments can be taken as how they are intended: to HELP improve the material. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean I agree with all of what they say, but these are the people who's opinions matter most and what they say WILL permeate my brain. It's nice working with people who don't have the ego's the size of continents and are trying to push you to be better at what you dol.  Anyhow, notes were taken, suggestions were addressed, and by the end of the night, we had Charles hard at work on re-recording Ash's basslines for MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Charles lent a whole new dynamic to the song, and wisely took the opportunity to play his parts in and out and around my various F-basslines (no longer Hook-basslines, ok?) to create some awesome dueling melodies and a sweeter chorus than the one we had written (and without making it sound like fucking Ned's Atomic Dustbin). Because of that, I edited a significant amount of my own bass out, which now makes those lines that much more dramatic when they enter the song. I'm psyched!  Well believe it or not, everyone had huge and I mean HUGE problems with the revamped 1956. At first, internally, I was a bit defensive about it, especially when Ash begged for it to be turned off (fucking drama queen), but once we got into a discussion about it and started to dissect the parts of the song, I began to understand the real problems of this song. The band really gave me the ability to stand back and look at this song, flaws and all. Along with Charles' new bass in MORNING, this was the most signficant thing that came out of the group meeting.  It was a fun night, and I got a ton of positive feedback from the aggression members on the artwork for the new remix album. I'm going to step away from it for a bit to gain some perspective and get back to it. Of course, during the evening, everyone stole each others IPODS and traded music. Ah, the modern age. So, much appreciation to Robin, Ash, and Charles for making some time for the Factor Corp. I would say 3/4 of what they suggested will be incorporated. the 1/4 is just artsy crap that they can do in their own band (j/k). Speaking of which, their material just improves by the second. I'm really feeling what they are doing...and you will too.  I think the group comments on 1956 effected Brandt as well as we spent a lot of Friday just talking about the song and what didn't work, etc. This led to Brandt and I meeting up early this morning to get to work on the next wave of this difficult song. Charles had called the song a musical 'Franksentein' as it had lots of good parts, but nothing that tied them together. Also, everyone seemed to have issues with the fact that there were so many loops. The new intro that I busted my ass on last week went out the door and I went back to the quick bang immediate start of the track (like THE MOTIVE). Then, the next thing we did was strip the song to its bare essentials of guitar, bass, drums and strings. Taking Charles' advice, I grabbed my bass, and B busted out his 12-string and we went and wrote a new section of the song that would successfully bridge the verse and chorus. It took a LONG time, it was a lot of hard work, but once we did this, we knew we had this song in a million times better place than it was when we started. It totally made sense to us why this song, up until this point, hadn't worked right. Brandt really took this one and ran and did several melodic and rocky guitar tracks to flesh it all out. While he was working out his parts, I was able to go into the computer and do some cool sound design on the guitar line I played in the verses. I smoothed it out, made it a little bit otherworldly and it fits much better within the song. Brandt later went in and re-did some of his verse wah guitars while I tightened robin's drums up to make it much more dance, more Stone Roses-y, which you know I love.  Again, none of this was easy, but it was totally worth it. This new section works incredibly and we were able to change the big guitar solo towards then end to incorpoate this new section (believe it or not, the solo fit perfectly over it). With that, I went and created a new arrangement that has VERY few loops (maybe some one bar loop flourishes every now and then) and can easily be played by a rock band live.   I got some Wanton Garden to go straight outta Chinatown as well as some DVDS (including the new BETTER TOMORROW remastered box set, which everyone should own instead of renting PAYCHECK). I checked out the new Andy Lau movie JIANG HU (also starring Irene's favourite Cantopop idol Edison Chen), but the movie was a bit lacking. Great idea, poor execution. Nice DVD package though.   10 bucks to anyone who can figure out what the hell happened to the release of the new Die Warzau album! It's killing me!  F         "
"             Here is today's fan mail, send to my hypefactor.com address:  'Rarely have I read through such a vast pile of horse manure.'  That's from Brandt's dad, who, if he is referring to this very blog, is saying my life is horse shit, right?  F          "

"             While I cannot write volumes about the KMFDM debate as I am on holiday in Praha and writing this on the clock in a 'net cafe, I will say this in response to FJ's query...  Sascha's comments about the making of  Money  are quite accurate, although some of what he said in the aforementioned interview was news even to me. At least two 'drafts' of  Money  were presented to Wax Trax! before the final version, and at least one of them was 'test pressed' (more on this in a minute). I knew very little about the first draft, but can only assume now that it was the  Split  LP mentioned by Sascha in the interview.  When I spent at least one day per week trolling the used bins of Chicago record stores in the mid-1990s, I came across two Wax Trax! 'test pressings' within the span of one week that were quite unusual. For the uninitiated vinyl geeks, 'test pressings' are produced by pressing plants to see if the master being used in the duplication process is flawed. Almost every record or CD is test-pressed at some point, often in limited quantities (as few as five to ten copies.) Sleeves and jackets are rarely included, with pressing plants substituting generic 'white labels' in lieu of real artwork.  Wax Trax!, however, test-pressed many of its records in far greater quantities and used the extras in promotional mailings to DJs and radio stations. Wax Trax! test pressings are relatively easy to spot, as most have computer-generated labels with the artist/album information and were produced by an American company called Hub-Servall.  These pop up in record stores and on eBay every few months, most selling for little more than a few dollars.  The identical Wax Trax! test pressings I found were for a KMFDM album called  Apart . Upon listening I realized that both were preliminary drafts of the  Money  LP that had made it as far as the test pressing stage, but had been aborted for whatever reason. I wrote Sascha for more information and he said that, indeed,  Money  went through two separate drafts, although En Esch was still 'in' the band at the time and he failed to elaborate on any of the backstory cited in the recent interview.  He did, however, ask for my one duplicate, as not even he had a copy, and I duly obliged with a mailing to Seattle.  For you KMFDM completists out there, you need not worry about missing any material.  Many of the songs ended up as remixes on singles from that era (ie 'Split-Apart' from  Vogue ), and the rest saw the light of the day on the KMFDM rarities compilation Wax Trax!/TVT released in the late 1990s.          "
"             In response to my previous post, the person I called out on the H-bar board regarding KMFDM's MONEY album has responded and with factual back-up to boot. He pointed me to a recent interview with Sascha KMFDM that gives the whole story: 'In 1991 we started recording MONEY. MONEY was not supposed to be called MONEY. It was supposed to be called SPLIT because En Esch and I decided to break up during the tour with Thrill Kill Kult in 1990. So we decided that our next recording budget would split half and a half. I would get one half and he would get one half and we would both make 5 songs. Back on those days it was all still on vinyl. So he made 5 songs, I made 5 songs and we threw the coin and decided who gets the A and who gets the B side of the record. WAX TRAX rejected B side which was the En Esch's side. They said it didn't sound like KMFDM at all and that they didn't like it.They didn't want to put it out because it didn't meet the criteria of the label. So they gave us more money. That's why we called it MONEY. That record was all about the money. And I finished up the album without En Esch and certainly that was kinda really bad blood between us because he felt sort of rejected.'  This is just a bit of what is probably one of the best interviews I have ever read with Sascha:   http://www.electromeda.net/audio/interviews/sascha_KMFDM.html  It's a good read, though I prefer Lucia interviews. I for one am surprised Wax Trax even rejected stuff back in those days. Discuss. You learn something new every day. And again, hearing stories like this confirms my belief that someone needs to write a book on all of this!  F         "
"             A few things on my mind while I have your attention:  On a late night visit to a magazine store on 3rd Ave, I noticed that some 'rock' magazine called REVOLVER had not only an article on Ministry, but also some kind of 'definitive' history of industrial music in. When I saw a 12 year old photo of Grandpa Al (not related to Grandpa Frank, Ash) I decided not to read the article, and I turned my attention to the horrible, inaccurate and insulting 'timeline' of industrial music. While I no longer have any love for the current state of this genre of music (mostly because no one good has come along in about 10 years), I do hold 'my' era (late 80's to late 90's) of it dear to my heart. To write something so poor and again, inaccurate, infuriates me beyond belief. The moron 'writer' who put this together goes so far as to talk about how Wax Trax founder Dannie Flescher passed away in 1995, when it was in fact Jim Nash. (God rest his soul). To me, this is a huge shitstain on the genre I started my musical career in. Fuck you, Revolver, you piece of shit magazine.  On the subject of I-rock, a member of the Chemlab newsboard stated this regarding KMFDM: 'For the money album, En Esch chose to do five songs and have Sascha do the other five, and WaxTrax rejected all of Esch's submissions. ' For some reason, I find this hard to believe so I have called this person out to state where this comes from. Some of you who read this are well versed in the history of this music (Meaning: HEY BRANDT), so I ask, have you heard this story before? Answers to come...  I feel its more than necessary for someone to go and write the history of shit shit down in a book and make it accurate. Mr. Gassman has been planning this for some time, often with my encouragement, and I hope being in a band doesn't distract him from writing said book. I constantly watch my employer get frustrated with the massive historical innacuracies in his chosen love, comic books, of which he knows basically everything (and I'm understating that), and I feel I'm going to fall into that same pit of frustration as time marches on. What happens when some 17 year old, curious about the genre, read REVOLVER's History of Industrial Rock and doesn't know better? Bullshit.  Anyhow on a better a note, the Durans first single with the original lineup in a million years has surfaced and it's gay and awesome and is called SUNRISE. I love it. I saw them play this when I saw them in California last year and my agent/lawyer/advistory said as a compliment 'ohh, its nice and gay. They sound like The Pet Shop Boys'. I liked the song, but felt it was semi weak when I first heard it. Obviously the Durans did too as they have made it a lot harder than I remember it and the results are awesome. It's still nice and gay, but unashamed in it's Duran-ness (listen to that funky bridge), yet entirely modern and NOW. The future bodes well for the full-length album, ASTRONAUT, due out in October.   I smell potential upcoming Album of the Year candidates in Duran Duran, Ian Brown, and Die Warzau. I was hoping for Oasis this year, but I don't think that's happening. Oh, and Saintface, of course! Speaking of which...  Last night, Irene and I spent some quality time 'summiting' (as the MOGpac would call it) with Mr. Peter Saintface, who has been way too busy of late to read this blog. Hopefully by now he is caught up, but suffice to say, he is quite busy, still mixing and is THIS CLOSE to finishing the record. I remember being THIS CLOSE to finishing records and there were many weeks and months and in some cases, years, to go. Regardless, I will refrain from bitching about not owning the album at least until I fly back from Paris. Peter is looking well and relaxed, especially for a man THIS CLOSE to finishing an album. He was helpful in my search for this weeks NME (Ian Brown cover!) and encouraging of our adventures to come in the UK and Paris. We then discussed our respective and mutual musical worlds and he is excited to someday meet Charles. Our mutual musical worlds should be criscrossing again sometime in September I believe.  Despite playing a lot of whiffle ball and Star Wars today, I was able to start work on another piece of art for Ash. Maybe he will like this one as much as I like his new songs. We shall see.  Anyhow, there is a pay per view tomorrow that I need to rest up for. Cheers  F         "
"             The days draw near before Irene and I head to the other part of the world, so the chaos is at double speed (even though I am taking the time to blog and she is on the couch watching a screener of TROY and I think slowly regretting it).  My morning was spent with our new friend Ben at at the Apple Store. Finally, someone there with some class and patience (though it was his last day there!) He handled a lot of my post-crash problems (reinstalling os9, etc) so I can get back into musical shape and he then addressed the physical problems facing this beaten-down Powerbook. I won't get into details, but its only 2 years old and looks like its been around for triple that. This stems from the fact that this computer has been all over the world with me and never stays in the same spot too long. You would think they would make these things a bit sturdier. Anyhow, lets just say Ben gave me the rock star treatment and this laptop will be as good as new by the time I return from Paris. Just so you know, his last two 'celebrity' clients at apple were myself (!) and Claire Danes, who i think he now has a crush on.  The rest of the day was spent interacting with lots of cool people. Observe:  Ash and I had a fun exchange all day via E-mail. I finally showed him my first piece for Ass Cobra and he started out REALLY liking it, and then in his own 'special' (as in special ed) Ash way, we had pretty much trashed the whole thing. HOWEVER, he gave me the music finally, which wil serve as the soundtrack to my European vacation. Hopefully, by the time I get back I'll have my head around the Cobra and get into it. Ash, Robin and Charles have an excellent new song called THREE WEEKS, which I am very fond of. I love that I be a fan of this band...  Leo V23 has found his way onto I-Chat, which is a big pleasant surprise for me. Instead of now waiting every month to see him and exchange new music, we now have the direct line. As he prepares for his first official gig as AM PACIFC, he sent me a new song called 11:11 which is one of the best things he has ever done. I'm sad I will be missing this gig for sure, but he knows my schedule and hopefully can book around it next time I'm in LA. As I type. we are trading various rarities, live tracks, etc from the likes of Cerati and Fresco, et al.  As if this isn't even a crazier day, Joe Saintface and I had a brief but nice exchange regarding the status of the new Saintface album. Regular readers of this blog will know that I am somewhat impatiently waiting for this album. It seems Joe is too. Supposedly, it was officially finished last night, though I will believe it when D'orge hears it, know what I mean? However, Peter, prepare to be stalked by your number 1 fan. I leave TUESDAY and need this in my I-Pod!  Speaking of Mr. Face, I might have failed to mention that a few E-exchanges with Peter have taken place this week regarding the second of the HF songs he is singing for EXIT STRATEGIES called CLEAN UP. He sent in his suggested edit for the song, most of which I didn't have a problem with other than the fact that he totally cut everything I loved about the song (Read: F-bass parts). Needless to say, he trimmed the song by two minutes, which it totally needed, but I think and shortened version of the long F-bass parts will come back as a bridge somewhere. The compromise should be very easy to figure out once he finishes the vocals.   Meanwhile, while Mr. Louche celebrates his anniversary and in preparation of our socializing in London next week, I have presented him a 'gameplan', which outlines some of what could be our immediate musical future together. Yes that sounds gay, but hopefully down the line, and if all goes according to plan you Louche fans will be happy labheads a year or two from now. Watch this space  I keep hoping Irene falls asleep watching TROY so I can watch the OASIS gig I taped on Trio this afternoon while we were at dinner. Fingers crossed!  F  PS: SOMEONE TEACH ASH HOW TO USE THIS FUCKING THING! THANKS.           "
"             Taking a break from music (and having a sick girlfriend at home) I caught up on my movies while also checking out several TV pilots that you all will be watching in the Fall. I'll clue you in on what I'm liking and what I'm not.  First off, though still ill, Irene (A real trooper!) mustered up the strength to see COLLATERAL with me on Saturday night. It's very very entertaining, but ultimately is a bit over the top. Cruise is good and occasionally scary, and while Jamie Foxx is starting to display the traits of a young Denzel, the role he played was better suited for someone of Denzel's age. They should have made Foxx look a bit older to get the character across better. Jada Smith, who I normally don't like (and can never figure out that middle name of hers), is entering a hott phase, which is never a bad thing. She was really good in this, though she didn't do much. Michael Mann, a brilliant director, has a knack for making LA look like the coolest place on the planet, when it is, in fact a wackass town. It's incredible how he films the worst parts of Los Angeles and makes it look 'cool'. CONSTANTINE is like this as well (and a much better movie). Anyhow, COLLATERAL was satisfying,  yet cartoony, but was ultimately good fun.  The rest of my movie viewing was all straight out of Hong Kong:  First off was Johnny To's new film BREAKING NEWS, which is a great semi-satire/political statement on the media and how it effects modern police tactics. As it progresses with its 'Die Hard in an Apartment Building' storyline, the police and criminals use the media and the internet against one another and it's very clever in it's execution. Simply put, I loved this film. It was smart and energetic and with the exception of the annoying as fuck Kelly Chen, the film was cast perfectly. I was happy to see Simon Yam (the Deniro to Johnny To's Scorcese) in a cameo and I think casting non-to regulars in the main roles was a smart choice. With movies like this, the superior PTU, and the stunning RUNNING ON KARMA, Johnny To has become HK's most diverse, daring and interesting director. He's the best thing to happen to HK cinema in a long time!  Next was the lighter ENTER THE PHEONIX, which features many of HK's younger stars (including Irene'sfave supporting actor Chapman To) and is directed by first time director and popular young star Stephen Fung (who looks like he could be a young and better looking Jackie Chan). it's a triad based identity switch comedy with gay overtones. Sounds like a lot, yeah? Well, its really ambitious, perhaps a bit too ambitious. Daniel Wu, who I watched a lot of this weekend, is a good looking young guy who can actually act and he plays the role of the gay son of a dead triad leader with a lot of emotion and wit. He reminded me of a young Yuen Biao (one of my all time faves, of course) and sure enough Yuen Biao plays his dad in it! To say I marked out for this would be an understatment. The long lost Third Brother (along with Jackie and Sammo Hung) really brings some much needed emotional weight to the proceedings and grounds the film in his all to brief moments on screen. if anyone in HK cinema deserves a comeback, its Yuen Biao, who was so awesome in his movies with Jackie and Sammo and in classics like PRODIGAL SON, ON THE RUN, and his best film bar none: RIGHTING WRONGS. Anyway, the rest of the movie was light and fun and it breezed by with some fun cameos, best of which was Jackie himself in the very last frame. In 2004, seeing Jackie and Yuen in the same movie is enough to make me smile.  Last but not least was the critically acclaimed ONE NIGHT IN MONGKOK, which again stars Daniel Wu, this time as a country bumpkin hitman who has come to HK to assassinate a triad leader while also searching for his lost love. The amazing, beautiful and underrated (and supposedly underfed) Cecillia Cheung plays the hooker he befriends along the way. This is more of an ensemble piece in which different stories intertwine throughout the most densely pouplated city in the world, Monkok. No one is clean in the movie, especially the cops, who do anything to cover their own flaws. The movie is dark, nasty and violent and is the first movie of that kind to really stir me in awhile. I think Cecillia gets a bum rap as an actress as she is GREAT in this (and also in RUNNING ON KARMA) and Daniel Wu could be, with some experience, the next Andy Lau. I can't recommend this movie any more highly. Probably the edgiest thing I've seen in awhile. GREAT stuff.  For more about these movies, check out http://www.lovehkfilm.com, which in my expert opinion is the best HK review site on the net.  I then turned my attention from HK Cinema to American Television and checked out 3 new shows that some of you will be watching in the coming season:  THE MOUNTIAN is typical WB fare except this time at a ski resort. Not a terrible plot, but the acting is so so, and Oliver Hudson, who I usually like, is kinda flat here. Basically its about a family fighting to keep the resort alive after the death of the family patriarch. Skinner from X-Files is the bad guy and Barbara Hershey, who has gone through a terrible face lift, plays the mother to the family of good guys. The show is filled with women who would make great ingrediants for a dope bowl of ass soup, and thats the best thing going for this. Not terrible, it's set up very well actually, but not something I'm going to be DVRing in September.  One show that is without a doubt on my must DVR list this season is LIFE AS WE KNOW IT (formerly knowin as DOIN' IT), which is an excellent modern coming of age series focused on three horny teenage boys who can only think about, well, doin' it. While the show seems like a straight up sex comedy while going into Ferris Bueller territory with the 3 leads breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience, halfway into it the show takes a dramatic turn and suddenly pours on tons of depth for all of the characters. It's EXTREMELY well done. The cast of total unknowns helps as well as they are not all WB pretty kid types and it helps make it seem more real. Kelly Osbourne (!) is part of the ensemble is shockingly good as the 'fat chick' who one of the boys really likes but is afraid to date for fear of being made fun of for dating the fat chick. This is a show full of surprises and funny moments, but has a lot of depth and out our of nowhere (but not out of place) character development which makes this my top choice for the 04 season (along with Drea D'matteo in JOEY, cause she is just the best). I learned after that certain writers from FREAKS AND GEEKS are involved with this show which explains a lot, and explains why ABC will probably cancel it quick because its smart, edgy and intelligent: things we normally don't associate with network television these days.  The third show is the highly touted JACK AND BOBBY, which is a smart and original show about two brothers (one in High School, the other just starting) in the year 2004, one of whom will become president of the United States 40 years from now. The show contains interstitals from the year 2049 in which they discuss the life of said president and how events in his younger life helped form the man he becomes. VERY clever. The two boys, though WB pretty, CAN act, which is good, but Christine Lahti as their overbearing and pothead mom needs to bring it down a few notches. She's a pain in the ass. Anyway, the set up is great, but my only complaint is that they reveal which brother will become president by the time the episode was over, which I think was a huge mistake. They could have milked this one for ages, and now it just becomes not 'which one becomes president', but 'what makes him president'. I think they may have jumped the shark with this one, but knowing the writers involved with this show, I have a feeling that my minor issues will disappear as the show progresses. This is one to watch!  In other TV news, Dan Hamill's favourite actor and former bandmate of Vincent Gallo, LUKAS HAAS, has joined the cast of 24 this season. I have a feeling that with the show being revamped, this could be a much stronger season than last.  Anyhow, I've rambled WAY too much and now you have Matt back to keep you occupied with his tales of gayness while I prepare for vacation.  F         "
"             Hello my friends. While taking holiday in eastern Europe I have gone for a record ten days without doing the following: checking my voicemail, checking my email, checking the DrudgeReport and checking the MOGworld blog. It is with great anticipation that I review all of these the moment I land in the USofA.  So, how am I able to type this now? Well, I am actually typing in into MS Word now – fortunately I have borrowed my legal gf’s laptop for the flight home – I have blogging as well as an Advertising take home final to attend to. I ended up borrowing this laptop because she is actually on a different flight than I – she is flying KLM back to JFK. Long story short, I was supposed to fly out on AirFrance tonight at 6.55p local time but since her flight was this AM at 10p, I got on the first flight for the NYC.  Having to pay a slight fee to allow for this, I learned at check that I was bumped up to business class – how brilliant – it reminds me of flights from London and Paris in trips gone by. When finally boarding, I was further delighted to learn that I had been upgraded again to First Class from Business. J Let me tell you – First Class is hard living. I’m about to down my third glass of champagne and consume a cheese plate prepared especially for me since the vegetarian meal was not available.  I think that after I blog and eat and work on my final, I might watch some Curb Your Enthusiasm as I know for a fact that I have that DVD in said laptop at the moment – what I am not sure, however, is whether I have my cd envelopes with about 15 other DVDs for my viewing pleasure. My only complaint is that the power outlet in my chair seems to cutout every 5minutes…so tough this First Class livin’.  Maybe later I will continue this blog to talk about my holiday…it includes but is not limited to the following: drug smuggling, French cars, industrial gods, gothic fags, German National Socialists, Hammerskins, miles of pavement, litres of petrol, millions of bugs and a black cat.  Ciao!  Someone near me is watching that Broken Glass movie with Hayden Christensen – HC is the Ryan Phillippe of the early 2000’s but without the hot wife. I don’t know what Lucas sees in this momo.  And the flight has been a bit on the turbulent side. And I’ve switched from champagne to Sprite – much more refreshing. I’ve already had the chance to load my pictures into this computer – some keepers, some real losers. I’ll share those at a later date. Now I have to try to finish my final so that I don’t have to worry about it once again on terraferma.  Well this flight continues to be turbulent – making me honestly nervous – and I never get nervous on flights. Let me use this opportunity to report on the musical aspect of my trip – M’ERA LUNA.  What started as a one day festival, M’ERA LUNA has ended up being one of the surviving German events bringing in over 25,000 visitors to a beautiful little town that is pretty much over run with jerks in full clad black outfits in middle of the summer. This is something I will never understand. I don’t care who you think you are or how embedded in the “scene” you think you are – there is no reason to dress head to toe in black, whether it’s cotton or polyester or PVC or leather – it’s just stupid. And the other thing I don’t understand is why these people who love their snow white tans don’t enlist the services of sunblock. I witnessed some of the most horrific tan lines on Saturday that I was in shock. These kids don’t make any sense to me. When the Douche and I were exposed to the “tanned-goth” of the Doomsday 2000 festival – that, too, didn’t make sense to me until this weekend: M’ERA LUNA 2000 was a week before the Doomsday fest we went to, so by the time we saw them, their terrible burns had turned tan. Just sayin’.  So the music. The Jax and I drove from Munich to Hildesheim with much ease and settled into our hostel only long enough to freshen up and hit the festival. Complaint number 1 – when you are charging 45 euros at the door for a single day ticket – ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS YOU FUCK! Or at least accept cards inside at the official t-shirt stands or have an ATM inside or something!!! After that setback and the realization that our purchasing power had greatly diminished even before entering the venue (an old airport), we wandered over to the main stage for the what was the second song of goth-rocker legend Wayne Hussey and The Mission. The band does not fit the man. I’m probably all wet on this but the guitarist looks a lot like Danny Lohner of NIN fame. The open-air affect was not nice to these guys. They put on a good performance considering the heat and the daylight and the stupid crowd. Following The Mission was L’Ame Immortelle – a band enjoyed by the Jax and a band I was interested in checking out because of the hype surrounding them and boy was I not disappointed – they sucked even worse than I had anticipated, though the crowd seemed to enjoy them greatly – see where I’m going here? This 6 piece included a drummer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist, female vocalist and male vocalist who doubled as cheerleader and occasionally hit a key or two. These cats were weak. Even the Jax was like asking if I felt like making a 4+ mile roundtrip walk to the nearest ATM rather than watch these guys. Pathetic.  We next ventured over to “the hangar” in great anticipation of Fixmer/McCarthy. We headed over a little early and ended up catching the end of In Strict Confidence’s set. I’m not positive, but I think there was another industrial band from LI called ISC, but this is not the same band. This four piece, including a female vocalist for one song, owned the hangar. Their music was a bit simplistic, but was catchy. The lead singer reminded me of Ash if he were a bit more assertive and could sing in a deep German voice. After leaving the stage at promptly the moment they were supposed to (these Germans are proficient at some things) about 70% of the packed hangar left. We made our way to pretty close to the stage and I was beaming with anticipation. Then all of the Nitzer Ebb shirts started filing in. Everyone was ready for something special. Terrance Fixmer, some techno guy, came out and did his own soundcheck only to retreat back behind a curtain for another five minutes before showtime. Truth be told I was not a big fan of this album – but that wasn’t stopping me from strapping on my messenger bag as close to me as possible in case I had to remind the Germans why we won WWII. So Fixmer comes back out and gets some sort of beat going…DUH DUH DUH DUH and the germans are going nuts b/c that’s something they can dance to. Then Douglas McCarthy comes out – aviator Ray Ban shades, close buzz haircut, dark blue Levis (hanging a bit low though), black shoes and a dark blue button down with the sleeves rolled up – and shouts “REMEMBER ME?!?!?!” This man knows that everyone is there not because of his new project but because of who HE is/was – and he didn’t make us wait a single second and Fixmer’s beat/ambient tune turned into the main bassline and drum tracks from “Join in the Chant”. I instantly handed the Jax my camera (What do you call a girl at a hard core show? Coat rack.), then first I said “I’m going to cry” and quickly followed it with “I’m going to go elbow some Germans in the face”. Less than 5seconds later I found myself 3feet from the barricade in the dead center of the stage. All I can say is that McCarthy has been doing this for about 20years and his voice is still like is on the So Bright, So Strong e.p. Other NE songs included Murderous, Control, I’m Here and Let Your Body Learn (as the encore). My only slight complaint is that the old NE songs(except for JItC) were a bit more big 4/4 beat as opposed to the originals and also he tended to leave out verses settling for the big payoff of the bridges and choruses – I guess best delivered over the big beat. I was disappointed in that but I do understand why it was done the way it was, but like DM bringing back Black Celebration for the last (?) tour – it’s just plain not as good.  Aside from having a wound on my elbow reopened by some faeg’s spike (causing blood to pour from my arm), I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to seeing them in the States – maybe Cesar can book it.  Looking at the interactive flight map I can see we are over Québec now – only an hour + outside of Newark – it’s a wonderful feeling entering your own timezone again. Returning to work tomorrow is going to be a giant nightmare but I guess it’s what one has to do in order to take these adventures.  Enough philosophizing – back to my homework for the remaining hour. Tchüess!!! (Brandt can correct my spelling)          "
"             Sadly, with a girlfriend with flu-like symptoms, my planned screening of COLLATERAL didn't happen. I tried to pawn off the tickets to various friends, but no takers. Hopefully tonight my significant other will be in better shape to see this film. I read the script and while it was good (not great), I feel the director and actors will elevate it to where it needs to be.  Meanwhile, I am hard at work doing lots of things NOT related to my music. This is only helped by the fact that one Brandt is somewhere like in Poland pretending he is 'cosmopolitan' when he is in fact, nothing more than Summer Man. Someone is gonna figure that out at some point and there will be some big ass trouble. Probably involving a big ass chick, knowing B. However, I have my own European trip to worry about, which will be Irene's first time in that direction of the world. While many people plan tours of historic sites and such, we are taking a more rock n roll approach to the trip and are just seeing gigs (at least in London) and being lazy as hell. So if you're British and you are at either the Twilight Singers, Primal Scream or David Cross (!) gigs in London this month, come say hello to the New Yorkers. Also on the cultural agenda for this trip: shopping, eating, and sleeping (probably in that order). And yes, I do intend to see a few old pals in London, mostly while Irene shops (Gilez, save me!).  Anyhow, I've become preliminary art idea for the band In Loving Memory, which has been referred to here jokingly as Ass Cobra and will be referred to as such from this point on. Yes, this is Ash and company and I'm fascinated by the challenge of coming up with a 'look' for this project. However, i have no fucking music for this project, which doesn't help me (ASH!). I heard some more of it last week and damn do I like it a lot. Charles has been the difference maker big time and has brought out the best in Robin and Ash. I have one concept piece done already, but I really want to spend time with this and do it right.  Our house continues (happily) to be MOG Central Station this week. Most of the week saw Agent/Lawyer/Advisor using MOGworld has her NYhomebase, though Irene has seen her more than I have. Also here was the 5 months preggers Mrs. Cramp, who is a riot and was introduced to Sizzling Rice Soup for the first time ever this week. Another convert! We dined with our new friend, Ben, who Irene and Mrs. Cramp befriended while trying to get Mrs. Cramp's laptop fixed at the Apple store. Ben is a cool dude and is studying to be a priest of some sort, and works at the apple store during his time away from Seminary School. Anyway, he too enjoyed the finer dining in Chinatown and as soon as I'm done with this entry, I will be heading down to see him to get this laptop into fighting shape. Aces.  FYI, I have tried to re-listen to new albums I have recently had problems with or didn't love just to make sure they weren't lost in the shuffle in the recent onslaught of 'too much new music at the same time'. Sadly, very few of the opinions stated in previous entries have changed. I still hate the new Prodigy album (Q Magazine agrees), i still hate the production on the Cure album (so does Simon Gallup supposedly), and I still just like the Interpol album. I have new respect for Muse since seeing them live and am now enjoying the albums much more. I'm still digging the Damage Manual album immensely and the new Clay People stuff (only have a few demos) rocks my pants silly.  I have tried to control my urge to run to a certain nearby bookstore to haunt the singer of my favourite band for mixes of what I think is his now completed album. It's so hard to be so restrainted. I know you read this, PLEASE PLEASE send me the album!  OK. Out for now.  F  P.S. The headline quote is from my 6 year old cousin, Eric, who is my clone who, upon hearing the title of STAR WARS EPISODE III, proceeded to quote every instance the word SITH (or has he pronounces it: Seeeth) was used in the previous 5 movies. I can't think of much that would be make me prouder of this boy. To hear him quote a random Darth Maul line is astounding and brings great joy. Attack of the clones indeed!         "
"             I forgot to add in my blog yesterday that despite the Cure appearing sluggish, the musicianship was solid as always, and Bob's voice was in AMAZING shape. He's an incredible singer...  Speaking of incredible singers, my pally Dan Neet (via my other pallyl TODD RYAN) sent some new Clay People tracks my way. Well I'm happy to report that so far, its another comeback worth salivating over. Dan is in TOP shape and the music is melodic, diverse and very very interesting. I like where this is going and I'm psyched to hear more. I believe he is working with some of the former members of Stabbing Westward, though the guitars are classic Clay. I think by now, many of you have heard the remix of the new song FAILURE, of which I have a fondness towards.  The Damage Manual remix album is also so far very very good. Maybe I'm a sucker for anything Connelly, but this CD is filled with very cool and different remixes. It doesnt really get boring and thats VERY tough on a remix album. This should be in the ipod for awhile (more than their previous releases).  Also, I acquired the VERY rare (so rare I literally got the last copies from a very random online store) of Leandro Fresco's CD's INVERNAL and VACACIONES. Both were released on the now defunct Fragil Discos label out of Argentina which also released Cerati's OCIO project some time ago. AMAZING ambient music. Impossible to get, but worth the month it took me to find it. Soundtracky and atmospheric and just kick ass. love it. I want to do something like this in the future.  It's a good time to love music...finally.  F         "
"             Still without any time to really take a day to rest, Irene and I, joined by G, Lurch and Ash (who graciously provided transport) went out to the landfill known as Randall's Island to check out The Cure's CURIOSA festival. The festival on paper is a good line up, filled with interesting bands, most of whom, with the exception of The Cure, I had yet to see. Therefore, this tour provided the opportunity for me to see bands I had been, ahem curious, about seeing perform live.  We hit some traffic so we didn't get to see all of Mogwai, so I have no review to present to you. Thus, the gig starts with Dan Hamill's dreamboat, Melissa Auf Der Maur, who is a redheaded hippie with sweet thighs. She's a bit spacey (not kevin) for my tastes, so once she started singing about horses, I felt it was time to get a smootie. Dan Hamill seemed pleased with the gig, so thats enough for me.   On the main stage, The Rapture took to the stage and they are super talented and super young. These kids look young enough to be The Kidd's kids, and that is saying something. However, they were fun, energetic and played a good set. The dude with the cowbell who dances like an idiot was at first very funny, then annoying, and in retrospect was back to being funny. There is something about The Rapture that never quite clicks with me musically, but they are crazy talented and have potential to really grow as a band. However, until then I felt like this tour had to be over in time for them to register for Freshman Orientation. They get a thumbs up from me.  Then we checked out something called Thursday. Total shit. I recall very little other than Irene deciding to stay at the second stage in order to get a good spot for Muse. She was rather focused and determined and downright scary. But I get like that too...  So then New York's supposed finest, INTERPOL, took to the stage. I'm a fan. I'm not a fanatic, but a fan, so I was really intruiged to see them more than any band on this tour. Sadly, this gig didn't deliver at all. They are lazy, they lack charisma and their performance flat out sucked. The best thing in the band is Carlos D, an amazing hipster douche, and that takes a lot for me to say. He had technical problems with his rig, which might have killed their momentum, but he literally is the only one besides the drummer who looks like they belong on a stage this size. The rythmn section carries this band far beyond anything it should be. The guitar player is a hack who's lack of style or distinction in his guitar playing and sound cripples this band immsenly. The singer's Ian Curtis gimmick goes way too far live and he sings without any conviction or passion. There is a BIG fucking difference between being cool in a nonchalant way and being nonchalant because you dont have the courage or skills to back it up.  However, let me say that they do have some great songs on record, especially the new song NARC. After seeing Saintface give their fucking lives in a clubs the night before, Interpol come off as hipster douche hasbeens at 30. The singer from Interpol should go to Mercury Lounge on August 28th for some serious lessons on how to be a frontman.  And yes that was Michael Saintface walking away after a few songs telling us 'I've seen enough'...  Luckily this horrible experience and the whole day was saved by current UK sensations MUSE who made everyone on this tour look like fucking amatuers. While I have always liked them on CD, my concern was that they were products of the NME hype machine. Well, I am happy to report that they are more than deserving of the hype they have gotten in the UK. They are shockingly good musicians and the energy they had on stage was staggering. It was the best 45 minutes of the day and one of the best performances I have seen in ages. Matt Bellamy, the frontman, plays guitar in ways that are alien and while this is a rock band, the use of occasional loops makes me a sucker for them. Worth the hype. And thanks to Muse for making my girlfriend a very happy fan. Great stuff.  And well...The Cure. They came on, and they played, and it was the first time I felt that they seemed, well, old. They seemed sluggish, especially when the limped through HIGH, and the new songs didn't translate nearly as well as I had hoped. Poor Simon Gallup kept trying to get the energy going and it just wasn't happening. I felt the set list lacked the diversity of other tours and I feel like I have heard this all played before. Of course the older stuff came across well and this was the first time I was REALLY into the very old stuff (Forest, 10:15), but the gig just lacked the spark, the energy, that they have had EVERY time I have seen them since 1989. The encore was great, however, and that helped a lot. I'm a sucker for a good outdoor gig, but when youre sitting on the grass swapping spit with your girl, you know the band just isn't delivering as they should.  The evening ended with the crew grabbing a late dinner at the Gramercy. No sign of Ryan Adams (who is playing here soon, but is so not worth 40 bucks to see). All in all it was a good day, saved by the brits in Muse, so cheers.  F         "

"       just add another one to the zoo roster... a big fat female robin has recently completed her nest... right outside my kitchen window, in the cross beams of the upstairs apartment's deck... and *RIGHT* over top of my BBQ.  robin doesn't like me very much. whenever I go to use the BBQ, I get chirped at, and it doesn't really sound like a 'hey, how YOU doing' chirp. It's more of a... 'get the heck away from my nest' chirp.   but then robin gets annoyed when I don't leave, and flys away and sits in the grass until I go back inside.   I think it's only a matter of time until I get dive bombed by said robin.         "
"       There is khaos in my life... and now there's also reason.  Today my mom called, and said 'I'm not encouraging you, but I'm at this place and they have free kittens. I'd rather you take a free kitten instead of paying another $100 for another kitten'  And that was that.  reason is grey & white with a (currently) black nose. He has four white paws, and he and khaos have been playing for over an hour now.  reason was born about April 1, which makes him almost exactly a month younger than khaos.

I don't know where I am staying, what the hotel will be like... don't even know what to pack. I just know that I have to be part of one seminar (I have to actually talk... UGH) and I have to attend my boss' other seminar... other than that, he said I could probably sneak off one of the days of the conference.  As well, there is a day at the end for all the participants to go on tours/etc. I knew I was sticking around at this job for some reason...          "

"       Today was another long day! Sight-seeing tour at 9 am (at least I could sleep in a little) and then went to check out a little craft-market... bought some interesting stuff... hit the mall... had McD's - cheeseburger (yes, tastes the same but the salt on the fries is different)... checked out the pool... cold. Went swimming anyway. Then went back to the south pier again... got some beautiful pictures of the area, then went on a spending spree in the surf shop there. Bought lots of things I didn't need to buy... hit the same restaurant as last night for some food... then cabbed it back to the hotel, went back to the mall... Now am very tired, but since some people from the conference have left me two messages since I left earlier today, I have to wait for them to come back again (shortly)...  I just got a call that said I am going on a day-trip tomorrow to a small town outside of the city... should be interesting... now it sort of feels like a vacation, but I've been doing so much I barely have time to sit down!

"       Well, the conference is finally over. Don't get me wrong - it was a great experience and I met some very interesting people... but when some of the students who were helping to organize/run the conference asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out with them last night, the answer was a very fast 'YES'.  It was so nice to get out and see a little bit of the city, and not have to think about work.  We went to a part of the city called Pontao. I can only describe this as 'tropical, but without the sand'. It was on one side of a man-made lake, and it was beautiful. I didn't get to take too many pictures because I was trying not to be too touristy, but I think I would like to return there today (in the daylight!).   Plus, the currency conversion is very favourable here... one 'real' (their currency) is about .44 of a Canadian Dollar... I think I will go shopping!  time for breakfast!         "
"       I have just sat through a twenty minute presentation on a topic that I actually know something about. And the authors made some very, *VERY* scary assumptions to base their work on. It not only annoyed me, it frightened me. They had a period for questions. Normally, I´m content to keep my mouth shut, but today I had to say something. I made a very valid point, speaking from extensive experience, and they, like most academics, really didn´t seem to get my point. ´Twas ever thus. They´re still wrong. Maybe someone else will explain it to them in Portuguese, because I was *very* clear in English... What´s scarier than their error though, is the fact that *I* picked it out right away... and it started me thinking: wow... I could write a paper so much more accurately on this topic than they have. (and someone would probably feel the same way about my presentation... vicious cycle!)  Someone shoot me now. Before I become one of them.         "

"       Today it was announced that not only will I have to drive to Toronto three times this week in order to pick up the visas for my trip (which I thought was already taken care of), I also have to pay to register for the conference... it's only 180 EUROS, and it HAS to be paid by VISA credit card... of course I have a visa... but i never activated the card because I don't use it.  So tomorrow: drive to my parents to activate the card and fax the registration form.  It's okay, I'll get the 180Euros back as soon as I receive my credit card bill... of course who knows how long the school will take to pay me back and i'll have to cover that bill before they give me the money...

I hope to make that happen tomorrow.. wish me luck.  It's 10 pm... that means that my kittens have just woken up. They only napped for about half an hour before I woke them both up and tried to get them to play. But for some reason, that half hour nap between 9:00 and 9:30 is enough to keep them going until the wee hours of the night... they prefer to wrestle on my bed while I'm in it.         "
"       there have been several plans over past weeks for obtaining a 'cat tree'. partially because I object to my computer chair (which has a nice high back) being used as a cat-climbing aparatus. I also object to it being a vertical cat-wrestling arena...  tonight I went to my parents and my mom and I made a 'cat tree'. a very simple one. plywood bottom & top, 4x4 'trunk', scraps of carpet. Brought it home. It's about 4 feet tall. Got it out of the car. Set it down on the driveway too hard and screwed the bottom up. I guess two of the screws didn't go right into the 4x4. Brought it inside, of course I don't have a drill or appropriate nails to stabilize the base.  Two bungee cords around the pillar in my kitchen did the trick.  But what I want to know is:  How do you bring a foreign object like this into an apartment and the kittens know IMMEDIATELY how to scale it and get on the top?  And if they got up there... why can't they get back down?  The height scares them a little (For the climbing down) so there's a temporary chair beside it now for dismounting.   But then again... khaos just ran into the patio door with his head. eek... need i say more?         "

Even as his end was drawing near, his thoughts went back to those days when blood coloured the rivers and hate flowed throught his veins.

"       In recent times, his voice was an unknown commodity to those around him. Only when the need was absolute did he voice his opinion. He was an island unto himself. Few men would choose the option of being stranded on an island -- away from humanity; away from life and its many pleasures -- but he would do it willingly.   Yes, there were times when he yearned for the human touch but they were few and far inbetween. He had changed. There were things that had caused him to change thus but he preferred not to think about them.  Now, he wondered where he would eventually end up. Would life greet him once again at the end of the tunnel?   Fear of the unknown is a potent force. But often it drives man to the extremes of his ability to do things. The fear of a deadline can drive one to perform to the best of his ability and it some cases it can break him.  He wished to discover; to explore; to step out into the unknown. He wondered whether he would have the courage to do so; to step out of his comfort circle and take on life once again.         "

On September 30, 1993, an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on Richter Scale rocked the districts of Latur and Osmanabad in the state of Maharashtra. The tremors were felt as far as Mumbai.  My family and everyone in the building were up in a jiffy and screaming for their lives. My brother shook me in a bid to wake me up. I looked up in a dazed manner, made sure that the TV did not fall down and promptly went back to sleep.  Then there was a time when my family was locked outside the house. No amount of ringing the bell and knocking the door managed to rouse me. They finally had to send in someone through the balcony to open the door from the inside.

"       i read a the abbot's blog about soulmates. i perfectly adore the comments. i used to beleive in soulmates aka 'destiny'. it is such crap for me now. i used to beleive that my ex was the one. i saw signs...actually, we did..everybody did. then things happened again...for reasons i can never explain.i am lost in space. i feel like i am a speck of dust in this universe. i dont even know the answer to a simple question of 'why'.  it has been two months of no communication. i do hate him. it was a lie when i said i forgave him for i havnt moved on.i still feel the sting in my veins. i can hear the laughter of his family behind my ears every single waking  moment in my life. was it his choice or theirs?? it doesnt matter..for he didnt give a fight. he just gave in. Now i question the four years that we shared. I may be mean. i may be cruel. I am just finding my way back again. i will never survive this pain knowing that i have not done nothing..like he did.  Do you know how it feels late at night when you feel your ur heart is just like being crushed into a pit of fuckin emotions? i never cursed in my blogs before. i never felt such hatred. Its sinking in. This is the moment that i always avoided. to hate him.to dispise him.But feeling this way is inevitable. i feel my emotions is going 6 feet under. and all that will be left is anger..hate.  when we parted, i shut my doors to everyone.i shut myself in a hallow box.there is no light for me to see. im blinded by everything. i shut it so tight that there is no air for me to breath.So tell me, is there such a thing called 'soulmate'? maybe.... maybe not. but this i know and proved, that there is a thing called pain.there is a thing called anger. there are tears.   i always say that penguins are the most devoted creature in this world. they spend all their life looking for their mate..and when they found it.they will never be apart.they will stick together. that is 'devotion' that is more than love. maybe that is the reason of why they have wings but they dont fly. Not like us. we dont have wings but we try to soar far away...we are never satisfied.  Cliche as it sounds but i know this is tru..' you will only know the importance of someone when they are gone' i feel that im joining the winds....like a grain of sand that was lost before..i will pick myself up and make a diffrence in my life. i still feel the 'hate'.

"       I once read that 'Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.'. i know that all this pain that i feel is caused by myself. For the reasons that i havnt forgotten nor have forgiven the person who caused this. Many times i told myself that I am ok. I have forgiven. I dont want to hate.that will be the last thing i want to do. For so long I have searched for answers on how to make my life a complete solace. I have loved. I loved more than myself. For love cannot be measured.A person under the spell acnnot say i will devote myself to you 80% and the rest is for mine. For when you love, you love without limitations.Surpass even your own restrictions.  Dont get me wrong, I can say that being with Him was the best and happiest moments of my life. I learned a lot.On how to be a woman as i am now.On how to love without expectaions. He was not just someone im inlove with..but he was a companion..a bestfriend...then was a fiance.  They say things happen for a reason.That was what is inculcated in my head right now.So there is no room for hate..for questions.I did not say anything. I diod not ask. I swallowed the circumstances like a bitter pill.  'Beware of the man who does not return your blow: he neither forgives you nor allows you to forgive yourself.' Maybe i shoul have asked why. It would be better if i hurt him. but i did not. I was not given a chance to do so. So here i am.   Always forgive your enemies—but never forget their names.As i type this down, I realized that 'forgiveness' is not for anybody else. Forgiveness is for myself. I have to let go. I have to Forgive. Not for him. But for me to regain myuself again.   But is forgiving also forgetting? let me know.     "
"       i lost my soul. i often wander around.walking like a faceless being. emotionless and numb. i remember not long ago..when i used to dance under the rain. lying on the wet earth. it bothers me not if all the dirt is smudged on my face... i would lay down in the cold wet ground...until my eyes sees nothing but blurry images.  i remember not long ago when i can ran naked across the room. it bothers me not if i have my imperfections, for my imperfection is my being. not too long ago..i can close my eyes and fear nothing. i would roam my world freely...i care not if i stumble and fall.. there is no such fear in my head everytime its dark.. for in my heart of hearts i know... i am not alone.  maybe life is not a box of chocolates at all. for i carried with me the box...for a long time... i did not open it fearing that the sweetness of life would end. then it did. I lost the box...my sweetness..my life...  four years was my forever. and forever is gone. it was taken away from me so fast that i didnt have the chance for any reaction. days past.....nights of slumber. i hear the past echoing in my ears...like a nightmare... late at night..i often cry... like all nights..like the night before yesterday.. and the night before that.  have you seen my soul?

"       i have never felt so numb in my life. as i was walking trough the grounds of a certain college... i felt this cold eery wind.. the breeze gave me a feeling of such dispair... i looked at the time.(it was 4:42) i saw this guy chasing his papers being blown away infront of me... i didnt bother to pick it up...i continued walking.. why is there a nostalgic moment... i can see a lot of sillouettes around me... lots of sounds....people walking....like a ray of light.... glares....sounds..mumblings... but as if i have my own time and space... a diffrent zone...im walking slowly... im numb... is it because of the cold cold wind??? im scared...i dont know why....i cant feel my hands...  after a while...the a cold breeze gushed in my face again... i stopped..it hurts so much... am i scared of the wind??? or the fact that i know im alone.... reality check... it is starting to sink in....

I was honest as i always was with him. i told him i was mad.i am. i am hurting. too much pain has endured because he never told me answers to my simple questions. i dont know why he did that. why he just ran away. he always does. he ran away from his family before... he ran away from school.. he ran away from me..and ran back to australia.  talk is cheap..you said that you will never go back there. you would stand on your own.. yuo love me..you want to get a good family.a good life...prove something.. but why do you always ran away?  it hurts me that you are like that. that you never keep your words...not to them..not even to me.  what is pride? regaining pride back is the only reason he gave me. but is what you did the solution to get the pride back? you just proved yourself that you cant stand on your decision before.  i dont know the answers really.. everybody who loved you..every body who beleived and supported you... you just turned them down. without saying a word. without being a man. its not about money. its not how good your job is.. its about your word. what you said before..about showing and proving your family that you can make it on your own is gone.   only you know the answer. so if pride is what ur trying to gain back.. you were 1 step close on getting it and proving it by standing on your word and fighting for the person or your future 'family', but all yuodid is throw it all away and lose all the people who gave you support and loved you like a family. mga lola, mga tita, kaibigan, lahat lahat na naniwala sayo, binigo mo lahat para lng sa sarili mo.   parang sinabi mop na rin na ' hindi ko pala kaya... sige, kayo na bahala...'  hindi habang panahon...tatakasn natin mga responsibilities natin... mga decisions...  masakit magmahal ng taong hindi mo alam kung totoo. kung andun lng sya dahil wala sya kasama. mahal pa rin kita. yoko ng ganto. ayoko ng mahal pa rin kita kahit sobrang sakit. kahit hindi ko alm kung totoo lahat. dahil hindi mo masabi..hindi mo masagot mga tanong ko ngayon...kung kailan ako ang humihingi ng konting panahon mo para sumagot.Maliit na bagay lng ang hinihingi ko.... yun lng.malaman ko lng.

"       Every time I hear a certain song… there is always…always a memory that comes with it. Just now, I listened to an eraserheads song. Funny how I was taken back in time. Back a couple of years ago. back in my college days. When everything was easy. everything was simple and friendship is sealed with laughter and a bottle of beer.  My college days were the best moments of my life. I have met all the people who touched and continue to touch my life until now. I have stumbled and fall. I had my ups and downs. met the people whom I loved. Those were the times that I made decisions that changed my life forever.  The path was never easy though, Lots of times I have cried too. But definitely with the people I really am close too. Living in the same house, sharing everything, may it be problems about school, about love, about life, about money. About family.  How I wish I could go back to the times when we will drive late at night to the grounds of UP sunken garden and just talk. I want to go back to the times I just sleep and have someone to embrace every time I am scared. I want to go back to the times when I was not hurt. When I was not alone. When I was not crying. When I was not feeling this shit.   Last year, I know that me, leaving the country was inevitable. So was scared to death for me finishing college. Not now. Not now that I am completely happy with my life. I know everything will change once I leave the country. And why am i stil shattered even though something inevitable will happen. I cant stop it.I know this years ago.   I miss my life so much. I miss the old me. I still am not complete. I can’t let go of my past. Its haunting me like d devil. It is so hard letting go.  I am not ready to leave my past and it is starting to give me too much pain. Damn. I hate it. I hate what I feel.      "

The father of an Egyptian boy killed in the attack said, 'What is his guilt? That's not only my child, this is an innocent child going to school,'  said. 'What is this? Terrorism? Islam? What is it? Those are not Muslims.' Meanwhile, an audiotape from the group behind the attack said that they will continue attacking Westerners until all had left the 'Arab peninsula.'

Now, if my main concern is console gaming, what do I care about how companies did with their handhelds? And vice versa. If I'm a GameCube junkie (or 'sheep' as they like to be called), I want to know what the bright sports were for the Cube, not the frickin' GBA.  In fact, with regard to console gaming, all that handhelds have succeeded in doing so far, are to  detract  from the enjoyment of console games. Any Cubers who were looking forward to multiplayer games over the internet &mdash; and are you gonna tell me that Mario Kart online wouldn't have been sweet? &mdash; can look at the GBA and Nintendo's push for GBA connectivity as the reason why it ain't happenin' for you. (Yeah, I know about Phantasy Star Online, where you've got to pay a monthly fee, and I'm also aware of the half-assedness of Warp Pipe.)  Then you have Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Inarguably made worse by Nintendo trying to cram GBA connectivity down people's throats. Problem is, a lot of people just want to play their console games, not be practically forced into buying extra GBAs just to make it remotely fun &mdash; one Japanese publication even gave the single player aspects  a negative score !  Now you see why I separate these things out?          "

"       Love Firefox. Loved it when it was still Firebird. It's been my default browser since around version 0.5 or so. Like Thunderbird, I even keep an eye on new nightly builds for new features or fixes that interest me. But now, about a month before they're supposed to release a version 1.0 milestone, the leadership has up and decided to get rid of the outstanding, very Windows XP-ish look that it had, and replace it with this rubbish called Winstripe. Since most Firefox users are used to Windows, it's really unclear why they've decided to shove this Mac look down everybody's throat. Bottom line, it stinks.  I don't want to be too harsh on the Winstripe creators &mdash; I know a lot of Mac users like the look. But when Firefox is a month away from going prime time, and users are stuck with a look that's more like amateur hour targetted at a platform that most people  don't  use, it's frigging ridiculous. And yeah, being Firefox, of course you can change the theme, but as a first impression to present to a newbie, this is horrific.

"       Man, I really hate to slag off the fantastic work that Ben Goodger and Scott MacGregor have accomplished with their respective Mozilla projects, Firefox and Thunderbird, but what I've seen lately is disheartening.  One or two milestone versions ago (either 0.4 or 0.5, I forget), and I was using Thunderbird for email about as often as I was using Outlook 2003. Then they came out with a new milestone that rejiggered their spam filter &mdash; and by 'rejiggering,' I mean made it stop working well. The old spam catcher was actually my favorite part of the program, because it did it so damn well! It caught the vast majority of my spam, with hardly ever a false positive. Now, since said rejiggering, despite following every release note instruction to a T, despite probably more than 10,000 emails having passed through its Inbox since the 'upgrade,' it hardly catches jack shit. And worse, I get some false positives, meaning I have to waste a ton of time double-checking my spam folder which I had gotten used to not needing to do with the old Thunderbird.  Ahh well, it seems I've lost patience with the program. I still collect my email with it, alongside Outlook 2003, but I pretty much don't even touch it anymore. And as the Inbox fills with hundreds and hundreds of spams, my inertia increases because I know if I start using it again I'll need to go through and clean all that crap out. Ugh...          "
"          Well, Ronald Wilson Reagan passed away today. Arguably the greatest American president since Lincoln (and only FDR is eligible for this debate), not just for starting the fall of the Soviet empire, but for the way he lifted Americans up and made them proud of themselves and their country again, as well as bringing conservative and libertarian principles to the mainstream. May God bless the Gipper and his spirit.           "

Well, nearly a week later, and we're still waiting...  I actually have no doubt that they know where they are. I just have every doubt in the world that they plan to go after them.

"       So, a national security advisor to the Clinton administration, who happens to be a foreign policy advisor to John Kerry, stuffs classified documents and notes about them into his jacket and down his pants and leaves the National Archives with them. Oh yeah, and can't produce all of them when confronted by the FBI. ( urlLink Link to AP story )    Good luck knowing about this if you read Tuesday's  NY Times . Somehow  urlLink their article  about the matter, authored by Mark Glassman, neglects to mention his association with Kerry, his attempt to conceal his removal of the documents -- why else would he have placed them in his clothing instead of with the rest of the documents he was carrying -- or, by his own admission, the fact that all the documents were returned. In fact, rather than omit the matter entirely, Glassman uses Sandy Berger's lawyer's comments to spin an impression that all the documents were indeed returned:   Mr. Berger returned all of the documents and notes to the archives in October, within a week of his learning they were missing, his lawyers said. Odd...Sandy Berger himself doesn't even make that claim. From the AP account by John Solomon:    'When I was informed by the Archives that there were documents missing, I immediately returned everything I had except for a few documents that I apparently had accidently discarded,' he said.   Whew, sure glad he's on the ball when it comes to national security!    So, is this a new low for the  NY Times , or just par for the course?                 "
"          No, it's not a picture of Vietnam vets letting Senator Kerry know what they thought of his anti-war activity.  Gotta wonder what posesses Reuters to take a pic like that, let alone publish it.

"   Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff   "
"   Hello all,  This is the first post on my blog I made to keep everyone in touch with what Jeff and I are doing out here in Maryland. I know we don't keep in touch as much as we'd like to, and I thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know what's been going on with us. So, just a quick overview and then I'll get up to date.  Jeff and I moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago. Although at the time we moved to Virginia to a nice apartment complex called Windsor at Potomac Vista in Woodbridge. It was a cute, 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer! My favorite thing in that apartment. We stayed there about 8 months and then moved to Maryland.  Why did we move? Well, in those 8 months that we lived there, Jeff got a job as a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin ( urlLink http://www.lockheedmartin.com ). The job was in Gaithersburg, MD and we thought it wouldn't be too bad of a commute for Jeff so that we could stay where we were. Boy were we wrong! He had a 2 and half hour commute one way, so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places. We thought, 5 hours driving, 40 hour work week, and him going to school full time was too much. So we moved.  We decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment. So we took the plunge! We used Weirchrt Relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking. It was just what we were looking for. 3 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, with another washer and dryer. Very important, those washer and dryers. :) So on April 1, 2004, we closed on the house and moved in! Jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day. Lucky dog.  So that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are. Now on to what we're doing. We bought a Cairn Terrier puppy soon after moving to our house. We named her Dogwood Cinderella, Cinder for short. She was so sweet as a tiny puppy, and now she's just so much fun. She loves people and can do all sorts of tricks. She can sit, stay, lay down, speak, and shake. The shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best.  We just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to West Virginia. It was beautiful. This summer has been nice and restful.  Coming up in our lives is school for Jeff. He'll continue at George Washington University as a grad student. This will be his last full year. I continue to work at Genetics and IVF ( urlLink http://www.givf.com ) in Fairfax, Virigina, making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing. Boy have I leared a lot!  We've been enjoying our time here in Maryland! More updates to come!  "

"             Hello, I’m back again………. Friday was simply great; I did wear a saree after all. Since I live close to work (about a 5 min drive) my friends made me go home and change into a saree. Luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me. The weekend was pretty busy. I met up with a few of my old office friends on Sunday after nearly 2 years. It was a huge effort on Ash’s part to get all of us together, but she did it nevertheless. It was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was, after we spoke for sometime, we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby!!!!! We all met up at Barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed. Jerry is now a manager doing Strategic Planning (playing Sin) :o), Dhanya and Ash are trainers, Bryan is a Quality Analyst, Anne is back in college and Sujit and Conrad are doing very well for themselves. Gayathri who apparently didn’t turn up on Sunday, is now in charge of training. Three years back, all of us just out of college, looking for some place to start our careers. We got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends. All of us were in one team fortunately J and we continued to work together. Being our first job, every one was very enthusiastic, especially Ash, she would come to work even on her days off; our manager had to literally drive her back home. It was these friends who like a dose of caffeine, kept me awake during night shifts (2:30 am – 11:30 am).They were one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work (and the salary also :0) We used to go sometimes to a resort on team outing’s and we used to have a ball. Getting back to work next morning was a problem, but that’s beside the point. Little by little, people started leaving; Sujit was the first one and then Anne, then Connie and Brian and then me. Ash, Gayathri, Dhanya and Jerry still work in the same place. As months and years went by, we lost touch; everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on Sunday was an ice-breaker. It was like re-living the good times we had, how this first job has molded our future, our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made. There is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life.          "
"              12th August After a long thought about what to post in my second blog, I am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when I need it the most. Well here I go anyway…….just another day at work, that too not too much of it. It’s not very nice when you finish your work at the beginning of that day and then you have about 3-4 hours left with nothing to do. I wish I could go home instead L 13th August I am back again, this is the second day and it’s taken me around 24 hours to write a few lines. Since the  Indian Independence Day  falls on a Sunday (waste of a good public holiday) we are having Independence Day celebrations in office today. To celebrate the spirit of Independence we decided to dress in Indian Traditional clothes. I conveniently forgot about it and realized this just before I could leave from home this morning and it was too late to decide to wear a saree. The Saree is the Indian Traditional Dress worn by the women. It is usually 5-6 yards longs and is draped around the waist in a very beautiful and elegant way which I don’t think I will ever be able to master. It takes me hours to wear the saree and even after that it looks like I’ve just wrapped a bed sheet around myselfL. A Saree comes in different fabrics, Chiffon, Georgette, Silk and Cotton, to name a few. There is a particular type of saree with a lot of gold thread woven in the fabric, this is called ‘Zari’ and it is the most beautiful Indian Dress I have ever seen. Everything is so colorful here, we’ve got the Indian flags all over the office and everyone looks so bright and beautiful in Indian Clothes. I’m off to celebrate our Independence……..bye            "

"       Thats what we all want to know right? Each day we wake up and visit the mirror, wondering what the day will bring and what we will be like. Yeah. Something like that.  Well lets see, im 24, a good ol taxpayer of the USofA. Born and raised in Oregon. On the surface im a cool guy. Not many enemies but lots of friends. I'm laid back, easy goin, pay my bills, own my home, have a good job, never been married and have a phat ride. I enjoy sports, anything outdoors, snowboarding, music, goofing off, just anything that makes me forget about work and responsibility. Raised a Christian and I still adhere to it, its my faith. At least whats left of it.   Under the surface is a different story I suppose. I'm still a cool guy. I still value things, friends and family, honor and respect. But things in my life have made it difficult to stand firm, to make myself solid. I have alot of hate, anger, and pain inside. Not at generalities, but at past experiences. The things ive seen happen to my family, my friends, and myself ... burns me inside. It's been 7 years since it all started. Since I began building that wall around my heart and bottling up all the hate. Watching from the sidelines as one thing after another hit me. Am I going to snap? Am I going to breakdown and end up on the front page? Doubt it. No matter whats inside I would still sacrifice my life for my friends or family without hesitation. That would be an honorable way to go instead of hitting the postal button and causing more chaos, right? I think.   Its a strange thing. Jesus taught us to have love for our neighbors. How can I be a Christian when I have such intense hatred for certain people? Have I failed that command? Who knows. Thats what I see in the mirror each morning. Conflict. Conflicts of my beliefs and raised perceptions against my past and what i've become.   Ohwell. Life is, life. It makes us who we are. Our surroundings, our parents, the generation we grow up into... all of it shapes us, molds us. No matter what we take in mentally or spiritually, there will always be a part that makes us unique individuals. The tricky thing is that part isnt unique from birth. It gets developed by society or experiences. Sure we may have some persona quirks from the ma n pa, but even those dont get tested until our impressionable teen years. The years we begin to question with WHY's, and HOW's ...   Ohwell. Hehe, thats been my motto lately, 'ohwell'. Used to be 'What doesnt kill you, makes you stronger' ... yeah, in my case its made me more spiteful, hateful, the pain getting worse.   Ohwell ...         "

"                 The problem was with a mismatch between the installed kernel and the identifier in the config file in the source tree. After recompiling a new kernel, rebooting, and rebuilding lirc, everything worked great.  After this I had problems getting mythtv to recognize the remote. I got the following errors:   mythtv: could not connect to socket mythtv: No such file or directory Failed to create lirc socket for mythtv   After a long and hard search I found that the culprit was that there were still some lirc files from the mandrake install left over. These are not mentioned on the mythtv website. Make sure to remove the liblirc_client0(.0) files from  /usr/lib  and recompile mythtv. Next I copied the lircrc file to the right directory  cp configfiles/hauppauge-lircrc-nativelirc ~/.mythtv/lircrc  and added the  urlLink mplayer commands  to this file.      "

"                 If mythfilldatabase grabbed a channel which you do not want to include in your TV listings, you can remove the entries from the xmltv config file and the MySQL database. This often happens with premium channels; for example, HBO or Showtime may be available on your cable TV system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that channel. Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.  First, comment out the channel from the  /.mythtv/ .xmltv file by inserting the word 'not ' (including the space) in front of the unwanted entry. This will prevent xmltv from grabbing future listings.  Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will not appear in the EPG or when changing channels. To delete the data from the database we need to perform some steps. First, assuming that HBO is channel 15, we need to find out the internal chanid used by MySQL:    $ mysql -u root mythconverg mysql> select chanid from channel where channum=15; +--------+ | chanid | +--------+ |   1015 | +--------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) mysql> delete from channel where chanid = 1015;    Old program data will be removed over the course of a week. However, you may want to immediately delete any current program listings for the channel that has been removed:    $ mysql -u root mythconverg mysql> delete from program where chanid = 1015;         "

"                 For users in holland, I've figured out how to tune the PVR250 with test_ioctl and Teletext. Here in the Netherlands, cable providers provide us with a frequency table where one can find how to tune your TV set channels to frequencies. This table can be found on the teletext pages of the provider. In almost every city this table is different, so we have to tune our TV sets whenever we move to a different city (or sometimes even a different street!).  This is a short example of such a frequency page (example from Almere Buiten):    Zender  Kanaal  MHZ Freq    Nederland 1  11-  216.00    Nederland 2  6+  184.00    Nederland 3  7+  192.00    Etc.         I've figured out that when you multiply the last number (MHZ Freq) by 16, you get the right frequency to use with the test_ioctl command. For example nederland 1:  # bc 216 * 16 = 3456  # test_ioctl -r tuner=0,freq=3456  Will get you tuned to channel nederland 1.  urlLink  Frequencie overzicht Delft       "

"                 This is just a simple howto on creating dvd's from the mpegs created buy a PVR250. Either captured in mythtv or by hand. You will need the following software installed on your system.    Avidemux2   mplayer (for the mplex program)   dvdauthor   dvdrecord   mkisofs    urlLink this script    chmod +x dvdcreate.sh  Now lets get onto the business of creating a dvd.     Open the mpeg with avidemux2. Edit the file the way you want and save it as DVD-PS, using whatever file name you prefer IE... mymovie.mpg   Now use the dvdcreate.sh script like....   sh /path/to/script/dvdcreate.sh  /path/to/mpeg/mymovie.mpg /path/to/mymovie  (this last part is created when the script is run, but you still have to give it a path and name)  That is all on line. Replace  /path/to/...  with your respective paths. Notice that the last part has no extention, it is a directory that contains the dvd video structure.    mkisofs -v -dvd-video -udf /path/to/mymovie > /path/to/mymovie.iso    dvdrecord -v -eject -dao -pad -data driveropts=burnfree dev=0,1,0  (replace with your acual device)  mymovie.iso    After the burn is complete you should now have a dvd that playes on most any dvd player.

"           yesterday was a great day, had learnt a lot of good things, one of them being that my core competency (all those doing a strategic management course shall understand the importance of this term) is my optimism. I remember gautam telling me that once, even writing that in my slam book ... but somehow on the way to a more professional life i had left it on the way somewhere .... but today morning i decided to be optimistic in life again ... wanted to look upto things the way i want to see them not the way the world makes me see them, beleive me it helps. Coz today morning I heard myself saying that today is going to be one of the best days of my life ... well dont know abt that but had a great day indeed. Rest aside, I am going to switzerland .... there is a whole list of people i need to thank for the same, the first and foremost being avantika who took the pains to sit on my essay for whatever time it took her to revise the entire thing from top to bottom (and the number of hrs surely exceeds 24) atleast i could have had had never ever come up with such a fantastic piece. prob it was the essay only that made them choose me besides salil since salil has a higher cg, somewhat better cv and overall had put in more effort that me, or maybe i dont know about it so should not comment. The idea is that they were to take only 1 from each insti, from our insti they took 2 so .... and .... and nothing else .... oops continuing on the list of people i need to thank includes Manjari (of course yes!), Sameer Singhdeo, and Sameer Lal for telling me that i cant write good poetry, Ms. Neerja Pande coz had it not been her I shall have had had sent a totally rotten essay to those guys ... What else, hmm lemme think .... i dont know, i am too excited about it  Somehow i like the idea of blogging, gives u a good way to express your own self. The day is going to be hectic ahead so wanted to live this moment all by my own self. Am going to delhi to meet a very very old [FEMALE] friend Supriti .... lets see how the thing comes up to be .... what else strat man presentation tomorrow and a lot lot lot of work to do for the same.  Chalo signing of on a more optimistic note !          "
"           Thanks Nakul for introducing me ...  i know this is quite a late since you introduced this to me, or rather i got to know abt it through u somehow .... but then its never too late, and i am lazy so both things go hand in hand  ok guys so all u guys who are reading this lemme tell you that i am poor at those writing skills (at one time i thought i was some big hot stud to write great things, now i know that most of what i wrote was what most people in this business school call globe, though i still regard this globe of high quality)  Its a tough world, and things this side are making things tougher, none the less every day is an opportunity to learn to witness something new, to understand someone more and to understand yourself more .... to improvise. Well if that is the case, today was a good day indeed. Started on a note of esteem self control [withheld from public display] and then went out with me spending a substantial time on my Strat Man project. The assignment was to prepare an industry note. All i was doing was going through several industry analysis and trying to figure out the same .... well in other words i was cutting and pasting. But somehow in the middle i realized that i know more now than what i knew during my summers (which were incidently in the same industry as the one i am working for: Telecom). Well how so ever incremental, i got to know more about things and the industry. Its not exactly fraud. Yes people are right, there is a lot of fraud around, and if you are reading this nakul i buy your argument about this. but then i still see the zeal in you to make a difference here and honestly speaking people need to keep upto their levels of zeal at all places ......   regarding knowing someone more, i had a long chat with manjari, and the best part is that i think i know her more now. no it is nothing drastic, but now i understand several of her actions over the 4 years we have been together .... i truly like the female and what she does to me when i am with her in whatever way !  I got to know myself more, and i am improvising   A good day indeed ....  anf for all those who dont know me, i am a very very very optimistic person. and ambitious too .... the next thing to do is to start writing a poem .... havent written one for quite sometime.  And if u are reading this, come back, revisit ... you shall see my writing skills come back to normal and imrprove also ... i am more determined now   Thanks Manjari         "

(I'm rereading the book, haven't read it in years)  ~~'Only when one is young,' she answered. 'When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.' He thought for a moment. 'Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?' he asked, looking at her across the table. 'A great many, I fear,' she cried. 'Then commit them over again,' he said gravely. 'To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.' 'A delightful theory!' she exclaimed. 'I must put it into practice.' 'A dangerous theory!' came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 'Yes,' he continued, 'that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.' A laugh ran round the table.~~  The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a 'certain age' they have to act a 'certain way'... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age... I can think of lots of 'follies' from my youth I would love to repeat... and do so on every available occasion....lol         "
"       Lacuna Coil. I suppose I am the last person to hear this group, but I just did so recently. They blew me away. My tastes in music vary widely. Classic rock, alternative rock, techno, country, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, new age, classical... just about anything but polka...(appologies to the polka fans out there.) This is my current 'obsession'. Living out in the boonies in southwestern Kansas has its advantages, but available radio stataions and nearby music stores are not among them. So, I listen to Lacuna Coil online, until I can get somewhere that actually sells their music.  Check out their website at:   urlLink http://www.lacunacoil.it/etc/html/eng/index.htm           "

Crystal Night  I walked out one crystal night and the air was cold and black every star held bright and true against it's midnight back The moon hung low above the trees as silent as a ghost and I sat there in the fields as frigid as a post This night was so gorgeous just like a movie scene and even the trees kept still to keep my view pristine My mind began to wonder through thoughts about this place It wished to share with someone nature's purest face But around me there was not a soul not a heart to make a sound and I knew I was all alone when I began to look around Then my heart felt empty like the space between the stars I knew the night alone couldn't heal all my scars So with that I began to walking back into the night i knew that I would need someone to help me win this fight So now I must leave this scene until some other time Because until I can share it it's just a song without a rhyme ~RAVEN~ If poetry interests you at all, you must check this site out... even if you are not goth, open your mind and experience something new...

"       Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy, but I never get to see him that much. haven't seen him in two weeks, or talked to him in over 1 week... I really think we could be perfect, except I need somone I can do things with... My sister (the 'golden child') has a great man. She always has great guys...and always gets her way, and has a perfect house...blah, blah, blah.... not to mention she is 6'1', about 130 wringing wet, is very pretty and very classically feminine... she has it all, always has....ANYWAY... She and her boyfriend are constantly together, doing things with his kids, and working on his farm together... he is very respected, he is the undersheriff of our county. I seem to have a sign on my forehead that says 'Losers Welcome', because that is the only group of men who ever ask me out... *sigh* Not that Steven is a loser, by all means, but he is so busy in his life, and set in his ways, he doesn't think about taking me with him to go do things, and I live 45 miles away, and most of the time he would have to pick me up because my ex-husband has my car...(long story) Anyway... life just kinda sucks, but seems I'd better get used to it, eh?         "
"       It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere, with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet, secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet... I am so glad we decided to stick it out and stay together, looks like we are going to be together for a long while... He told me, 'I have finally decided to admit it...after three years, I admit that I love you, and I want more of you in my life.' then he asked me what I thought about that... I said 'It's about damn time...'  LOL... Patience Perserveres... the good girl wins out in the end...lol Life couldn't get much better than this...lol         "
"       I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's... I am so psyched... I hope that my patience has paid off.. He has come to a point in his life where he wants to settle down with one woman he can trust... And, he says, the only one he can trust is me... That he has always known that I was the one... Said I scared him a bit, because I understood him way more than any other woman ever has... He isn't the sort to get close to anyone, really.. But we are close, and that has bothered him in the past, but he has accepted it now... He knows I love him no matter what... We will see how it goes... I have thought this was happening in the past, only to go months without hearing from him... But maybe this is the time... I'm holding back judgment, though, I have been hurt too much before... We shall see... There are a couple of guys who have been sort of trying to get me to see them, but they are both attached... Both of them not traditionally married, but have live-in girlfriends... And I just won't go there... I talked to both of them last night, and they both made slightly jealous little comments...LOL... I am just not that sort of girl... Plus, Steven has always been the 'high standard' in my heart... No one lives up to him....         "

"       I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years. He goes months without calling me, but every time he calls, I go back to him... It's hard to explain, but he is exactly what I want... And if living this way is the cost of being able to be with him occasionally, I suppose its worth it... He is EXTREMELY intelligent, 6'4', 240,piercing blue eyes, very intense, disciplined, confident...But he is also very kind, and caring... He makes me feel completely safe when I am with him... And even in the months in-between, I know that if anything happens to me, I can call on him and he will be there... If anyone ever hurt me, I know he would 'take care of it'... He is a little scary, maybe, knowing what I know about the world he lives in, and some of the people he knows... But he is so strong, I have always felt like he was my 'protector'...  Anyway, he has contacted me again... It is so wonderful seeing his messages, knowing he is still thinking about me, even if his life gets too complicated to call or email me at times... Maybe I will go to be with him soon, that would be wonderful...Someday, I hope to be with him all the time... But until then, I will take what I can get...         "

Anyway, I didn't have any sleep before I went in, and I was dead by the time I got home... got woke up by severe thunderstorms this  morning... hail as big as shooter marbles...now its just wet and gloomy... Will be going to sleep later, have to go in to work at midnight, (my own shift this time!) This gloomy day will make for good sleeping...

"       This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.  Everyone in this town works their ass off trying to be just like every one else.  Someone needs to tell them that the world does not end at the county line. We are citizens of the world, not just of Hick County.  Around here, music means classic rock or country. Period. (Nothing wrong with either... I listen to those too...) I listen to Gothic, punk,&nbsp;alternative, jazz, R&amp;B, soul, classical, techno, industrial, you name it... Anything but polka...LOL I have friends around the world, (online) and from all religions and races. If most of the people here knew I had friends that were Pagan, or wiccan, or heaven forbid Agnostic, I would probably be burned at the stake.  I get so tired of know-it-all people who never think outside the box... I love art, and poetry, and good literature... I crave intelligent conversation, on literature, philosophy, religion... I want to be able to buy really good clothes without driving 250 miles... (I HATE Wal-Mart!) I long for coffee shops, with real cappuchino, not the powdered kind that sputters out of a machine like bad hot cocoa... A book store with a good selection, a music store that actually has the music I want (Cooper Temple Clause is an unheard of group in this God-forsaken place!!) I want to get my nose pierced without losing my job. (Yes, I was told I can't work where I work with my nose pierced!)  My house is probably the only one for miles that is decorated in modern furniture and artwork... (95% of all homes here are done in 'cutsey' country... )  All women are expected to be sweet little things, quiet, 'respectful'... that isn't me either! I am tough, intelligent, and that scares most rednecks...  What am I still doing here??  I wanted my son to go to a small school. Not one with rampant drugs, and teen pregnancies, and security guards...  I suppose this is a small price to pay for my son, but I will be 49 years old when he is 18... Will I be too old to start my *real* life then????              "
"       Why can't I just learn to say no!? Last night at work, a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while. We... Well, for lack of a better term, were 'fuck buddies' when I was in high school. He was with another woman, but while she was busy at the counter, he came back and talked to me...Flirting, hinting at things that we had done 'back then', and asked for my phone number and email... And I gave it to him!  I know for a fact that he is not interested in what I am looking for... I want a real relationship, I want someone that respects me, cares about me. He just wants someone to 'play' with... I KNOW THAT, so WHY did I not just say no??!?  When I married my husband, I loved him. But I also had, in the back of my mind, the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him, so I'd better say yes. That recording seems to be still playing in my head, as if I should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me. I know that is what I am doing, yet when the man is standing there I don't think about it... I don't say no... I simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device.&nbsp; I get so mad at myself sometimes... I seem to be scared to say no...  &nbsp; I have been doing the same thing with another man, Stuart. All he is looking for is a good time... But I tell him, oh yeah, I'll call.... Instead of just telling him that we want different things, and a 'roll in the hay' is not what I want...  Someday, somehow, this has got to change... But IM not sure how to get there...            "
"       I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads, that I KNOW are dead ends. Not real roads, but life's roads... I usually ONLY am attracted to older men. I have never really been attracted to younger men. BUT... I have a friend that is 10 years younger than me that I am VERY attracted to. Not a bad thing in and of itself, BUT he has a girlfriend. A pretty permanent one.  Why do I always fall for the ones I can't have? Girlfriends, wives... Every man I find myself being attracted to is already attached... Isn't there some psychological reasoning behind that??  Maybe it's just that what they say is true... All the good ones are taken... I don't know, but it drives me crazy... And HE drives me crazy... And it doesn't help that he is an incessant flirt, that just makes me feel worse... **NOTE TO GUYS: If you are otherwise attached, please don't be a tease! If you are not happy in your relationship, get out of it, THEN you can flirt... It's not fair otherwise...         "

"       i was a weedy child. this wasn't so much an accident of physiology, more an unnecessary attempt by the world to fully cast me in the role of maths geek. of course, at that age i wasn't of a mind to worry; but eventually i decided that i was hideous. there is one particular family holiday where all the photos have me hiding in the shadows, for fear of nothing less than being seen.  and then i grew up a little; and found out that whilst i would never be very well built, so to speak, i had quietly grown to a respectable height amongst my peers. i started putting more stock not in how i looked but how i carried myself; i started losing my clumsiness. and now whilst i'm still not much to look at, my body ususlly does what i ask of it, what i need it to.  i got comfortable with myself, i accepted what i was never going to be. although i could never be a nudist, and for two very good reasons: i) the cold, and ii) my need for pockets.  and did i mention, the cold?  i generally have lots of things in my pockets; i find it is one of the better things about men's clothes: there is no 'line' to ruin, as such. so i feel if naturism was to become compulsory, i'd need some sort of utility belt. and a nipple piercing to stop me losing my keys, obviously, but firstly a utility belt. being naked is no excuse for not having a grappling hook handy...   man, i'm tired.   n.

"       i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable. although certain claims on my snoring would seem to indicate otherwise. add to this the effects of returning to training after an extended bout of laziness, and we have a recipe for why i am only just surfacing now to eat the chocolate muffin left for me.  i hope the pain goes away; being the paranoid type is never easy at these times. also in light of the amount of dwontime i've been having; its a medical observation that the longer you stay in bed past the 'normal' eight hours or so, the greater your chances of having a stroke....  well, i think its funny.   almost five months to the day of living here, i realise i do not own a can-opener. this can be interpreted as a good sign (i don't live off canned food), or a bad sign (i live on toast; toast doesn't come in cans). ah well.   plans for today: call evil car hire firm call non-evil laura eat non-evil food pay evil credit card bill maybe even go outside   the world is my (non-evil) lobster.  n.

"       &nbsp;  but solitaire is a lonely man's game.  &nbsp; abstraction is a wonderful skill; it not only allows me to separate my higher functions and so see myself as 'i' (the notation becomes tricky) see other people, but also allows me to effectively ignore the world.  &nbsp; other theories and observations that i intend to share are mainly statistical in nature; i am forever intrigued at the difference between the individual case and the ensemble outlook. so much of the world is chaotic; and yet the word itself defines the world as completely and rigorously deterministic. but even this is statistical; the macroscopic newtonian world is merely an ensemble of the quantum level, where chaos is replaced by true uncertainty.  and yet things fall downwards; and they always will. bizarre.  &nbsp; i am fascinated by the notion of bringing order from disorder; matt ridley is keen to point out that humans (and living creatures&nbsp;in general) are merely localised anomalies of order in a world overrun by entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics.  i am reminded of the startling man lennart green, a card magician extraordinaire. this is a man that can have a deck of cards shuffled, and will then restore the entire order (suits and values) without you noticing. it is astounding; i saw him do it at a lecture once, and i was impressed. i learned the theory of how to do it; i was more impressed.  this brings me to my favourite current way of wasting time: spider solitaire. here we have an unending supply of disorder, waiting to be ordered. and when you win, you click 'yes' and there are yet more cards to sort. lucky i'm not the obsessive type, eh?  (bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.

"       &nbsp; in my head, and in response to an email i received discussing the separation of beauty and personality, i have compiled a top five list of girls i have been most attracted to. this list was much harder to make, and i'm still only up to four. at present,&nbsp;and in alphabetical order, it runs:  ceri charlotte chloe helen  &nbsp; the crucial point, though, is that none of the previous list appear here. the above were all girls i have been lucky enough to get to know well, whereas the previous list is made up more of acquaintances (exceptions are my sister and caroline). i leave you to make your own conclusion: do the above people appear more attractive because i know them well, or&nbsp;did i get to know them well because i firstly found them attractive? do the two go hand in hand because you will get to know people more if their personality fits yours, and thus you will also tend to find them more attractive?  disclaimer: i have no intention of upsetting anyone! i would be the first to concede that my opinions on many things are a little skewed; and i would urge anyone to remember that my notion of attractiveness is often in direct conflict with other people's. there is precisely no worldly advantage in being found attractive by me, unless you&nbsp;find&nbsp;me attractive in return. and how often does that happen?  &nbsp; so anyway; today's scheduled laundry was postponed for the duration of 'the magnificent seven', a wonderful film that i force on unsuspecting people from time to time. whilst it will cast me out of certain circles i will have to confess to never having seen 'the seven samurai', although i do like the kurosawa i have seen. my favourite quote from the film is yul brynner's response to the idea that farmers tell their women that the gunslingers will rape them:  'well, we might. in my opinion, though, you could have given us the benefit of the doubt.'  the dialogue throughout the film is brilliantly measured; i should like to write characters like that. maybe one day&nbsp;i shall.  &nbsp;  ongoing arguments with my mother struggle to keep within the boudaries of reason; she avoids the issue of whether she believes me (essentially anything i say, ever) despite my asking the question directly at least four times. i know the answer is no from everything else she says, but i still want to hear her say it. i can disprove all of her assumptions but she does not care for that. and in line with all the things my therapy is uncovering she demands of me that i suppress my own character. i have no desire to do that; maybe when i was young, but no more. when she starting telling me i didn't care i&nbsp;undoubtedly did, but these days my answer is tempered by the turbulence in my own mind over who i actually am. personality conflicts with conditioning; and the problem lies in that whatever shaped me has made me into someone who needs to question the validity of those implemented ideals. i cannot respect you if you lie to me, and i cannot trust you if you yourself do not recognise that you lie.  like i say, ongoing issues. but apparently they aren't important.  &nbsp; i should also like to apologise to anyone who overheard my attempt at playing the piano this evening. 'a long december' never sounded so long, i'm sure...  n.      "
"       &nbsp;  aside: you know you've done well with your lunch when the stacked sandwiches are as tall as they are wide...  as i sit planning - yes, planning - what to write i am torn as to what my actual aim is; if i am diverting then that is more than good enough, but surely i have something more to share? to this end i will attempt, from time to time,&nbsp;to expound on some of the theories i have formed about how things work. if nothing else, it will be a useful insight to the way my mind works, and how i perceive the world.  the first that comes to mind is 'leapfrogging buses', or 'how to not get infuriated on your way home'. more on that in&nbsp;a minute.  &nbsp; hold your thumb and first finger out, very close together. now, without them touching, try to move them closer. closer still. yes? now, that is how close i was to buying a polaroid instamatic camera on thursday. i saw one (two, actually, but one appeared to date from the paeleolithic era and wouldn't have looked out of place with a pin-hole) in a charity shop, and spent a good five minutes toying with the idea. i've always wanted one, that i can remember; something about the self-containment appeals to me. but i didn't buy it in the end out of respect for my ever-dire financial situation (camera = cheap; film = expensive) and also the thought that i may be mistaken for someone taking 'candid' (nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more squire) photos at home. a label i wouldn't mind so much if it was a remote possibility, but sadly not.  today's list is of things that are not really fruit but can be classed as one of the day's five portions since they are healthy: a glass of milk vitamin supplement pill opening a window taking the stairs thinking about having some fruit  its true; you know it is.  &nbsp;   leapfrogging buses: a theory.  more of an observation, really.  some simplifying assumptions:  i) all buses travel the same route, at the same driving speed. ii) all passengers are travelling to the end of the line.  iii) all distributions are normal. iv) there are no price/ticket considerations in choosing buses. v) all stops are the same duration.  (these&nbsp;will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've&nbsp;started it as simple as possible)  imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run.   this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at  every other  stop and thus&nbsp;completing the run&nbsp;faster.  however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with  an amount  of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid.&nbsp;so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause  those  stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog.  &nbsp; so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row.  assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour,&nbsp;or will have a ticket for a certain bus&nbsp;company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately.  whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour  in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus:  yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no:&nbsp;&nbsp;no distance/order change between buses  if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging.  &nbsp;  and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely.  anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me.  n.

"       &nbsp;  i leave the room for ten minutes, and when i come back the radio is playing 'club tropicana'. this sort of behavior must not be tolerated; i have urgently restored 'hate', by the delgados, to the cd player. hopefully the day can yet be recovered.  &nbsp; the train company wrote to me again;they say they're very sorry my train was late setting off, late arriving, and was without lighting and heating for about a third of the journey. here, have three pounds.  the thing that gets me is that they're not even doing it deliberately to make me laugh; they're actually serious. if i only had a car. oh, wait, i  do  have a car. i just can't afford the insurance. and why? because its about three times as much as the car is worth. without any no-claims bonuses, i can't afford the first year premiums, and thus will never get any no-claims bonuses. grr.  and here's the thing: if you  are  insured, and you have a crash, they put your premiums up! its like they're saying 'ah, yes, well we didn't think you'd actually  crash . we were just taking money off you; if you want to  crash  then that'll be extra.'  &nbsp; from the bus today i saw anna; i was tempted to get off and run back to talk to her but i figured my life has enough complications, and anyway last time i saw her about three weeks ago we were on the same bus and i saw her and i think she saw me, but either she didn't recognise me or wanted to appear as if she didn't. i'm putting it down to my then outrageous hair; i have too many issues to explore the more likely scenarios.  &nbsp; the five prettiest girls i have ever known (in some sort of particular order): my sister on her wedding day pink laura clare slater anna ball caroline rogers  i make no claims on personality or overall attractiveness; just prettiness. it is worth noting that i have only been out with one of them (caroline, before anyone starts), and that whilst at one point i may have ended up sharing a house with laura i never actually knew her surname. it is also worth noting that they are all very lovely people, easy to get on with, and intelligent. i guess this goes to underline that it's nigh impossible to truly separate personality and prettiness. yes...  &nbsp; (and also:&nbsp;naomi tan almost made the list. just so you know. i'm sure she's gutted.)  &nbsp; man, the delgados rule.  n.  &nbsp;     "

"       let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist. here, the rules of causality can be circumvented. consequence still follows action, but is no longer inextricably linked; the two can be separated. we can pay for our mistakes at our convenience, so as not to cause unnecessary suffering. imagine.  i was first introduced to this place by a dear friend of mine, who uses a love story as illustration. i keep the details deliberately vague. a boy has been with a girl for many years, and meets another girl whilst living abroad and falls in love. but it is an unknown love; the love of a few months knowing someone. and the question becomes is the chance of this one new person being the 'one' (if there is such a thing; statistics dictate otherwise, but hey) worth the irrepairable damage that will undoubtedly happen to the existing relationship? his answer, as i think most people's would be, was no.  but wouldn't you like to know? have the freedom to explore that possibility without having to hurt anyone? this is possible here. your mistakes are yours to make, and they will not inadvertantly destroy anyone else's happiness. like so many things; it probably wouldn't work, but its a nice thought experiment.    on conditional love: i can't really be doing with it. i think i should rather be loved because i have earned that love; because i am worth being loved. my body and mind are a statistical genetic result, and as such it is an accident that i am 'me'. any number of different people could have resulted. even if conception is deliberate (as is not often the case), then to be 'contractually obliged' as a parent to love the offspring regardless of their character is absolving the child of the responsibility to try to be a decent person, and absolving the parents of the responsibility to try and raise the child to be so. a responsibility i believe everyone should have: to try, at least. it is my noblest and most human characteristic that i do not consider myself to be 'enough', this is the only thing that ever pushes me to be more than i was, than i am.   n.

"       there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'. firstly, it occurred to me to respond to the advert; surely there is money to be made for a young lad with a passable face and a willingness to submit his hair to the whim of fashion? and then secondly, i had a much better idea: i shall hang my own of these notices in my window, and see what comes of it. models wanted.   actually, it isn't true. i am so much more content with real people, capable of conversing and, where necessary, cutting me down. girls with charm are welcome, models need not apply. i just liked the thought of it, that's all.  i am watching films recommended to me by my therapist. i am intrigued to know what his aim is, and what my reaction will be.   a historical note: 'interesting' was the last word i ever said to charlotte. i do not recall who hung up immediately after.  even as i lay dying i am certain the experience will fascinate me. my epitaph, already planned (and which i fully allow anyone to use, if they wish), will read: 'that was interesting'.   in my lifei have been guilty of many things, and innocent of many also. my wonder at the world is matched easily by my cynicism, and yet the one ever-persistent feature is fascination with the sensation of living. it is fair to say i have never felt anything like it. recently spending time with ceri reminds me of the fervour with which she embraces life, and the way with her i couldn't help but do the same. i try to remember that when the time requires it.   a downbeat post; my apologies. and it started so well. i often find that this is the way things happen. although, to be fair, often the other way too. how interesting.

"       seriously. don't get me started.  seriously.   well look, it's like this. i find haircuts traumatic; possibly moreso than most things in my life. if that sounds odd, consider this. i have never - ever - in my life received a haircut that i was happy with. content, even. not one. ever. i am twenty five; having been alive for a quarter of a century, how many haircuts do you suppose i have had? how many have you had? i haven't liked a single one of them. not one.   let me elaborate. haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers; it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut, or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane. so then you decide to get it cut, and things get serious. what cut do you want? how do you want to appear to the rest of the world? i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring 'yes, i paid money to look this specific way'. and why do i hate that idea? i pay money to dress the way i do, to go the places i do, so what's the difference? ah, good question, and the answer is one of life's little secrets: hairdressers never do what you ask them to. they only ever do *what they were going to anyway*. it makes no matter what you say to them, you will only ever leave the shop when *they* are happy that you look like they want you to. we are helpless; once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over, and we never get it back. we are at the mercy of the hairdresser; someone, you'll note, who invariably has hair that you personally wouldn't be seen dead with. strange, that, eh? yes its true, whatever you ask for you're leaving looking 'trendy'.  or even worse, as happened to me last time: having an interview the next day i asked to look 'sensible'. i actually came out looking 'like i was in the marines'. tossers. (hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.

"       i have cracked spider solitaire. last week i came up with a method of defeating it, and i haven't lost a game since. some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky, but i've completed every single one. now, everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one, but today i tried a game on the hard setting. i completed it. convinced?  i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire,  every frame can be beaten . an obvious statement, perhaps, but important, i think. i developed the idea on the two-suit variety, and i haven't done it rigorously, but i hope you'll get the idea. general principles, then.   i) always keep a spare cell when you can. this is the most useful space since anything can be put there. always work to be making a new spare cell; the more the better.  ii) keep a track on colour (or suit) changes; the less, the better. always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can. before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board.  iii) clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card; runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards.  iv) if you have many of one card value, then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving non-running cards on top of them.  v) using two free spaces, simple runs of different suits can be moved using the  urlLink tower of hanoi  principle.  vi) completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched 'useful' and 'unuseful' cards.  vii) stacking up suit-changing runs isn't a bad thing; it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end. it is common (on the medium setting) to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea.   but, most importantly, and the key to the whole issue, is that  you have to remove the element of chance  from the game. if you rely on luck, there is a good chance you will be beaten. if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game. (it is up to you whether you consider this worthwhile, or 'in the spirit of the game'; i started doing it to investigate whether each frame is possible. it is possible that each frame is possible in a number of ways, but i'm not sure how to show this). i call this 'the riley method'; and basically it means being ruthless, and  never  giving up. the key to this is the 'undo' function. if something doesn't look like its working out, go back. try something else. you can undo back to the last suit-removal or new row, and often you'll need to try a few different approaches. mostly, the objective is to complete another suit, but beware that this can scupper you if you've filled all the spare cells, so be careful.   overall, then, i can't say this will guarantee you success. i've been playing cards since i was little and i've built up a good understanding of cardplay, and i have a fairly mathematical brain to start with. but i thought i'd mention it; if only to explain what i've been doing with my time. i'd be interested to hear any comments anyone has; and again i haven't looked to see if anyone has written about this before, i prefer working the puzzle myself.   list of puzzles i that i looked up the answer for:  urlLink the morris sequence  (my favourite sequence puzzle ever)  urlLink rubik's clock  (well, lee dicks told me because he's an arrogant bastard but i'd showed no signs of getting the answer myself)  there are probably others.  n.

"       an interesting weekend.  no, let me put it differently. a great weekend. an outstanding weekend. made so by the presence of a certain scouser that has been decidedly missing from my life of late. whilst the reunion wasn't everything i'd hoped for, i do concede that sometimes clothes  are  necessary...  a trip to liverpool brings back many memories, all of them good, and adds many more besides. promises to go again soon are much less than idle, i assure you. returning to manchester on saturday with alex in hand, so to speak, we are able to catch up on months of pointless chattering, which is always good. having to fulfil a promise i made a long time ago (under duress, i'm sure), i dug out the magic box and did some tricks; the reaction i got makes me wonder why i ever gave it up. well, maybe i didn't, really. just a change of emphasis. i couldn't help but be amused that the patter was all still there in my head; maybe my childhood wasn't so wasted after all. some of the shows we did! completely daft, but they've got to be some of my favourite times. those days we were indestructible; we could do anything, so we did. not such a bad way of living.  they say that you can have too much of a good thing, and the takeaway pizza almost had the better of me, but i outwitted it in the end. with the intention of getting horrendously drunk we then proceeded to get dressed for the night out; i put some shoes on, whilst maria and alex proceeded to try everything on twice, straighten their hair (i idly did a bit of my fringe but succeeded only in looking like i was from  urlLink franz ferdinand ), put contact lenses in, and lord knows what else (i wasn't allowed in the room, no matter how nicely i asked). turns out that the two of them are exactly the same size in clothes, which is both convenient and a little worrying. apparently they got ready in remarkably quick time. apparently.  any concerns i had about it getting too late for us to become entirely inebriated were soon put to rest with our arrival at  urlLink kro bar , where we swiftly ordered the strawberry beer we'd been looking forward to. finding ceri and some assorted chemists also at the bar was a bonus, and with the addition of gargantuan paul made a decent eight. and there we stayed until closing, whereupon we sauntered to the inestimably groovy big hands. ceri's admirable figure and sharp eyes getting us entry discount and a table respectively, it all worked out very well indeed. as we proceeded to drink and shoot the distinct lack of breeze, and on the promise of some frankly lewd behaviour (yet to materialise; i should have got it written down, dammit) i repeated the elastic band trick a couple of times. the principle of never repating a trick can be bent slightly with the addition of alcohol, i find. discussions of kung fu and swaying to the sounds of  urlLink manu chao  give way  to me being told that i am gay 'because i know cat's cradle'. hmmm, and you think they'd be impressed that you could do it with elastic bands. and so, into the night air, and bus rides addressing urgent questions: are we going to bed now, or are we not?  not. instead we are to go to maria's to collect wine (and for paul to steal stella from the fridge, leaving four pounds and the note 'have nicked your stella, buy yourself a palace') and to go 'ssssh!' very loudly, before back to mine to talk about... erm... well anyway, it was good.   sunday morning is true studenthood; a rota system was set up for maria, alex and i to use the shower, the single bowl, and single mug. the idea of simply sharing each one in turn was mooted; but optimism is a good thing, y'know? being thoroughly exhausted and all resting on the single bed together, the look on greg's face when he came to knock on the window was priceless. 'this never happens in my room!' he says, mock-seriously. i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter; i just smile and leave the illusion. that's showbiz.  n.

"       well now. please excuse my absence, and also the fact that in the near future i may not be around so much. there was this thing, you see, and there was an issue, and so we all moved and we're not there any more. and i'm so tired of running around being responsible that i shan't say much more.  urlLink greg , less uprooted than myself, has written an account of the last couple of days. all i shall say is: no internet connection is losing, secretly stealing illegal mini-fridge for personal use is winning.  in other news i now have my mouse up and running, and it is lovely. i am also considering buying an inexpensive digital camera to supplement this here site with illustrations of exactly what the hell i'm talking about. you have been warned.   on monday night, as i lay awake before the onslaught of the day to come and during the onslaught of the rain which surely played its part, i got to thinking of a story from my past that i should like to share. the reason i thought of it was my (by now usual) insomnia, and all those fruitless efforts people make to try to sleep when their body (albeit ready to drop) is having none of it.  secondary school; before i gave up my childish dreams of doing something i wanted in life, i took a GCSE in drama. part of this course was taken by a large, somewhat sweaty man called george cockroft, who looked not a little like  urlLink john mccririck . which, thinking back, is a bit weird. i liked him a lot; he was an intelligent man who (for all i know on the subject) taught us well. but there is one lesson that still stays with me: in the drama studio (a big room that could be blacked out, essentially) one time he had the entire class of around twenty five lay flat on our backs, completely relaxed, whilst all the lights were turned out. and as we lasy there in the dark (the giggling subsided eventually) he began to talk to us, taking us through a systematic relaxation of our bodies. it was amazing; i think over half of us fell asleep, and the rest of us had never been so still. i still use the same technique today; and with discipline, it works.  at the end of the fifth year, when we had taken our exams and all was done, mr cockroft was leaving the school. and i remember one day (it may have been sports day), a beautifully sunny day, being outside on the field and having a brief talk with him. i imagine i said something like how much i'd enjoyed the drama course, and doing the plays, and the such. i imagine he said something like he was glad i'd enjoyed it, etc. and then i said something like 'so, i'm not sure when i'll see you again', and i remember him looking at me in a mysterious, almost mischievious way (this man was about fifty-five, i reckon), and saying 'oh, i think it'll be sooner than you think...'   i never saw him again.  n.      "
"       the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia, but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed. right now i am wearing only the shorts that earned me the name of 'chicken legs' earlier this year. maybe it is something about this room that tends the occupant towards nudity?  but i have done well today; visiting town for the briefest time i have bought a mouse for purely rational. as much as i like the trackpad, it is time for seriousness. seriosity, if you will.  serioucism?  anyway; the online delivery charge of 30% of the mouse's worth causing the trip to town, i was pleased to quickly find the one i wanted on the shelf. in a cylindrical-type packaging, admittedly very fetching, there was no information as to whether the software is on cd or diskette. i asked the man in the shop 'is the software on cd for this mouse?'. i held up the mouse i meant. 'oh yes', he said.  let me tell you now, he is a lying swine.  so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver. purely rational has no floppy drive ( it is a laptop of the  future , and besides i couldn't be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive). my old laptop  does  have a floppy drive, but it doesn't have a cd burner. nor does it have a modem or network plug. or usb ports. (it is a laptop of the  past , and besides, it was free). in fact, of their 26 assorted ports and things, there is  no way whatsoever  that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra (read: 'expensive') hardware. shocking. anyway, i've arranged for it to be done now. but ergh, it annoys me. i might write a snotty letter to dixons (no link because they are evil evil lying swine, although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices) and hope they send me  urlLink something cool .   new cd: welcome interstate managers, by fountains of wayne. very good.   stopping by the supermarket on the way home to spend a fortune (£14) on my continued survival, it is interesting to note the hastily-erected shelving selling umbrellas. in august? sheesh. i pick up some essentials (bread, milk), some healthy things (oranges, tomatoes), and some random bits (stir-fry sauce, biscuits). i have recently taken to swiss-style meusli, that is to say meusli with raisins, nuts, and no extreme political views.  i resent paying over  urlLink 50p  for a loaf of bread; sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away (as i did this morning). i am now trying 'stays fresher longer' bread, 44p. i have high hopes; except i have doubt about the grammar. shouldn't it be 'stays  fresh  longer', or just 'stays fresher'? or am i too worried about my bread?   the last thing to mention today is the post office; and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service. i am sending a friend a cd, and i am enclosing a brief letter with it. if i send it as a 'small package', it is cheaper than sending it letter-rate. imagine you are sending someone a book; if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent (relatively) cheaply. if, however, you enclose a 'letter' with it, then as far as the post office is concerned the  entire weight  of the parcel is your letter, and you are charged accordingly. but what constitutes a 'letter'? for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending. so, if you write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it' then no problem. but write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it. little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday...' then pow! you have just (according to the postal service) written a comic novel. so if they ask you if there's a letter inside when you're at the counter, you know what to say. and you too can make sure you're sending things as cheaply as possible, even if it does mean you have to write (as i do) 'small package' on everything you send...   nmrboy's currently favoured dinner: pasta (enough for 2, cooked) cheese (small cubes of) cooked ham (diced) tomato (1, raw, chopped) olive oil ( extra  virgin, whatever that means) basil (not a siberian hamster)  all mixed round together, serve hot and frequently. food = good; or at least its the most similar word you can form with a standard 'qwerty' keyboard. coincidence? well, probably...  n.

"       a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive, they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done, but more of an imposition than anything else.  thesis word count: 650  like i say, a slow day. but, i have been having some fairly interesting thinks. i mean thoughts.  i) truth: if everything we know or learn is (necessarily) brought to us by our own perception, then it doesn't matter whether there is any absolute truth because we will never know it.  ii) labels: labels on relationships only serve to give rise to expectations of certain behaviour; expectations drawn from the media, demographic ensembles and hearsay that can never realistcally be matched by any random (that is to say non-specific) individual. this mis-matching of expectation with reality (regardless of how perfect the reality) leads to disappointment and eventually conflict. the need to categorise things is an outward desire, and serves no purpose to the individuals involved, who will tend to know what's going on. the driving force is to have a neat labelled pigeon-hole-type box for the relationship that others will understand with the minimum of explanation; but if every relationship (an analogue quantity if every there was one) is forced into one of any number of discrete boxes (digital classification) then the fit will never ne perfect (analogue-to-digitl conversion, and information is irrevocably lost). its just  laziness , that's all. pisses me off that people can break up over such an unnecessary thing.  iii) gravy boats and gravy trains. no gravy planes.  iv) language: when was the last time anyone described themselves to you as 'hot' or 'cold', instead of 'really hot' or 'really cold' (or the like)? language is something that people invented, and yet they don't use it properly? if words have definitions, and we can invent new words with appropriate definitions as needs be, then why isn't language sufficient to expess what we want to say? and if it  is  sufficient, then why don't we use it properly? this follows a conversation i had recently, which went roughly as follows:  ros: i guess that depends on what you mean by 'happy'. guil: the oxford english dictionary defines it as 'feeling or showing pleasure or contentment'. ros: yeah, well i wouldn't define it  that  way.  anyone else find that amusing/frustrating? mind you, to get technical, i guess it depends how you define 'definition'. or something.   enough thoughts! i should get out more.  v) i should get out more.   todays's list is of synonyms for 'list': bank careen heel incline lean slant slope tilt tip   n.

"       it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people. the main downside to (gasp) not having a mobile telephone was brought back to me today when it transpires that my best friend tried to call last night, and i wasn't around. unfortunate rather than malicious, but i'm still a little sad about it. especially since i was erely over in the common room, chain-watching buffy the vampire slayer until three in the morning. sorry, chief.  and as to the advice i can give you? its all guesswork, i'm afraid. there is no greater mystery than the intricacies of  urlLink women .   commenting on the heat (32 degrees! and not fahrenheit, you picky lot) in his office, he notes that he is becoming the incredible sweating man; and between us we decide that this would make a better arch-nemesis than super-hero. homeostasis as a way of fighting crime? hmm...   and yes, i measaured the bread. but i only did it roughly (to establish its non-squareyness), since presumably there is a variation in each slice, and trying to find the mean and standard deviation would just be silly. no, really. and what was the greatest thing before sliced bread? and when they made the first sliced loaf, did it have an even number of slices so making sandwiches was more convenient? what would they do with the last slice? and were the sparrows fatter?  all important questions, i'm sure you'll agree.   also catching my eye just yesterday was the notices around the lake (i use the word loosely) in our nearby park; reading danger: deep water, and danger: thin ice. now surely thin ice is only a danger because of the deep water beneath it? well, i suppose you could slip over, but i'm not sure that's what the sign is getting at. surely the sign should read:  danger: deep water danger: thin ice danger: gravity   i think this could also be applied to other situations:  danger: cliff face danger: gravity  danger: sharp bend danger: newton's  urlLink first law of motion    you get the idea. i will undoubtedly have something else to say at some point; but for now, i think tea and toast is the way forward. breakfast is, after all, the most important meal of the day. that's why i have it three times a day.  n.

"            Last week a tour group came to the church.  They were from a church from another town, and were members of a different denomination. It was an interesting 90 minutes. At one point everyone was gathered around the altar. One lady asked what we do around the altar. I told her how our entire community gathers around the altar for communion, how we want everyone close to the table and how everyone particiaptes in the prayer over the bread and wine. So far so good. Then it happened. She got to the heart of what she really wanted to know.   Who can come to communion in your church?,  she asked. My pat answer is well rehearsed. I told her: Jesus invited everyone to his table so we invite everyone to God's table. We give communion to everyone by name-- without exception. She was polite about my response, but clearly appalled.   You mean you don't have to be confirmed?  No, baptism is full membership in our church.   Oh, so you do at least require baptism?  No, we don't require that either.  That's when it really happened. That small exchange revealed the core issue: who is worthy to receive the sacrament? I did my best to explain, to reveal our community's understanding and values, but we didnt' get very far. Our versions of how to live the faith simply didn't match up. She was more concerned with preserving the proscriptive rules of institution of Christianity. I am more interested in the faith continues to live and breathe right in our midst. I don't believe the faith needs to be protected-- but I do believe that institutional Christianity works overtime trying to protect itself. From what I don't quite know. Usually I think it is trying to protect itself from the Spirit.  I believe that as we continue to practice our faith and touch the reality of what it means to live a human life, our beliefs change. We don't need to be afraid of this. In the course of our study and practice, as we touch reality more and more deeply, our beliefs naturally evolve and become more solid. When our beliefs are based on our own direct experience of reality and not on notions offered by others, no one can shake them from us. Making a longterm commitment to a concept is much more dangerous.  Our faith must be alive. It cannot be just a set of rigid beliefs and notions. Our faith must evolve every day and bring us joy, peace, freedom, and love. Faith implies practice, living our daily life in mindfulness. Some people think that prayer involves only our minds or our hearts. But we also have to pray with our bodies, with our actions in the world. And our actions must be modelled after those of the living Christ.  pax [+]          "
"             excerpt from a recent sermon on Luke 12.49-56        In Liberia, a teenaged girl prepares for baptism in the Anglican church. Her parents objected violently to her decision to become a Christian. A few weeks before her scheduled baptism, her parents had her killed.  When I was in college, one of my Jewish friends converted to Christianity. His parents responded by publicly declaring him dead and hold public funeral for him so their friends could join in the mourning.  My colleague Nancy Sehested was called to be pastor of a Southern Baptist Church in Memphis. She was the first woman to hold such a position. The county Baptist association threw the church of out of the association. Later that same year the national Baptist convention severed all ties with that church.  Do you know stories like that?  Like the parents who raise their kids to be doctors and lawyers. They think they’ve almost succeeded when the last one announces he wants to be a minister, and their faces fall. But he goes off the seminary anyway, and then they draw up their wills and he is not in them? Or like the grown children who find out how much money their elderly parents are giving away to a church-run orphanage in the Midwest and who have mom and dad declared mentally incompetent in order to protect their inheritance?  Or like the mother who will not speak to her two adult children because one left the church of his youth for a place where he speaks in tongues and the other refuses to go to any church at all? These are painful stories for any of us who have close family ties and who also hold deep religious convictions. Christ’s invitation to follow him can divide a family, even destroy a family. Jesus acknowledges that pain.  What is so disturbing about these stories is that Jesus does not say they should not be so. In fact, he says the opposite. He says they are inevitable, that the gospel is inherently divisive and that we should not be surprised when we fight about it.  Ever seen that the bumper sticker or the t-shirt that says, “Dear Jesus, protect me from your followers”? I don’t fear God. I don’t fear the government (too much) or the dreaded forces of secularism or humanism. But I do sometimes fear my fellow Christians. There are times when I feel downright intimidated by those I-am-confident-that-I-have-the-corner-on-truth, overachieving, judgmental persons who use the Christian faith as the sanction to denounce and threaten people.  Hate mail and hate crimes increase every year. Well-funded religious and political leaders in certain sectors of the population promote an aggressive “spiritual warfare” against those who will not be numbered among them.  Not too long ago there was a story of college seniors being escorted at night campus security from the library to their dormitory because “Christian” students had spoken about the kinds of things that should happen to people like them if they were caught alone at night. Devious, isn’t it? No direct threat, just the creation of a terrifying atmosphere in which to live.  Maybe Luke was conscious of the growing schism between the followers of Jesus and other Jews in his time. Or maybe he was well aware that Roman law would not grant legal standing to the newly flourishing Christian faith. Maybe he knew Christians who were humiliated in the street or forbidden to attend family reunions with Jewish relatives. But could have imagined the waves of persecution instigated by Christians throughout the ages? I think of Matthew Shepherd who was brutally beaten and his body strapped to a fence in subzero weather-- because he was gay. He was brutally killed by kids who celebrated their form of Christianity.  We think these kinds of incidents are easy to dismiss. We say to ourselves, “this is not Christianity, but a perversion of its deepest truths.” And that is true. But is also true that we so easily fail to communicate unequivocally the most simple of its truths: all persons are created in the image of God.  I suspect all of us have probably experienced painful division at one time or another in our own families. Our religious community in Toledo remains very divided. Trouble is, the deepest divisions are to be found within Christianity right now. So it makes sense that the claims of Christ may all too often call us to stand in opposition to our friends and parents or brothers and sisters. That is neither Good News or Bad News. It’s simply the cost of commitment.  How do we deal with it? How do we stay in communion with those whose vision of God and God’s claim upon their lives is different form our own? How do we stay together? Sometimes we can’t. The differences are just too great. But there is another way.  First, be faithful to the voice of God you hear within you. To deny it is to die to your own integrity. Second, and more important, resist the temptation to claim for yourself more understanding than those with whom you disagree. Instead, listen to them share their understanding. Perhaps you can be helped to hear the voice of God they hear. To deny that possibility is to deny God.          "

"            Have you heard about the latest scandal  to hit institutional Christianity? It's wafer-gate. Seems that Christ can only be found in wheat. Who knew? Normally I don't really care about this kind of liturgical trivia, but I can't shake this story. Here's an excerpt that ran in the  Asbury Park Press  (New Jersey) earlier this week.    Liz Pelly-Waldman of Brielle is trying to convince the Catholic Churchto validate her daughter Haley Waldman's First Holy Communion. BRIELLE -- A woman who is protesting the Diocese of Trenton's decisionto invalidate her daughter's First Holy Communion because analternative wafer was used in the communion sacrament has taken hercase to Rome. Liz Pelly-Waldman of Evergreen Avenue has written to Cardinal JosephRatzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith inthe Vatican, to plead her case for allowing the use in communion ofhosts that do not contain the food protein gluten, found in wheat andother grains. Church rules maintain that for a wafer -- or host -- tobe 'valid matter' in communion, it must contain gluten. Pelly-Waldman, 30, wants that changed to allow her daughter, Haley,and others like her who suffer from celiac sprue disease, to receivethe sacrament of communion. For people with the disease -- one out ofevery 133 people, according to one estimate -- ingesting gluten causesthe body's immune system to attack the small intestine's lining, whichcan lead to malnutrition and possibly cancer. Pelly-Waldman contendsthat any form of the 'approved' wheat-based host -- including a newlow-gluten version -- can be fatal to Haley.         Now I don't mean to bash the RCC here-- there but for the grace of God goes any our spiritual glass houses. And it really makes me sad to to hear of the RCC wanting another ditch in which to die, but I do want to use it to highlight what has become so very wrong with institutional Christianity. When did Chrisitanity become Churchianity? For those of us who believe in the real presence of Christ methinks this story misses a deeper truth.       The mystery of the sacrament is not contained in its substance. The sacraments are only made real by the witness of human life. Sort of like the old question about who hears a tree falling in the woods if no one is there. When a community makes Eucharist (gives thanks) together they reveal the deeper communion that is also present-- and more important. Communion is a word for a deep connection with God and with one another. You can't have real communion if that means the little girl has to be excluded from it.      What matters most is not the bread, but inclusion. If baptism is full membership in the church (that's the Episcopal way), then there can't be barriers to full participation in the life of that church. We have to make room. If including a gluten-free alternative is what someone needs, then that's what we do.     Later in the article the mom says that she doesn't believe that her child's relationship with Christ is affected by an ingredient, a technicality.  She also makes a good case for the difference between God's laws and all the others we make around God.    I've just never understood the need the legislate the presence of God.                  "

Here's what I ate:  1/2 order of Australian fries (with ranch and cheese; served by folks who talk like Aussies), 1/2 order of cheese curds, one entire root beer float, a medium sprite at the food barn.  Can I gripe about a few things though?  The swine barn, cattle barn and sheep barn were all closed for cleaning to bring in new animals, so I did not get to see my favorite part:  the champion (pronounced champine) hog.  But the state fair people still made me pay my full eight dollars to get in!  How does that work?         "

"           Last Christmas, Hal gave me a few calendars. One of them is a 'Perpetual Postcard Calendar' from the Tate Gallery. I just thought I would share the description of one of the more unique postcards:  'Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View'  Garden shed and contents, blown up for the artist by the British Army.  Of course, this picture isn't as interesting as 'Misty and Jimmy Paulette, NYC' -- two drag queens in the back of a cab. 'Zagi' is a painting of a naked lady stretching her calves against a wall, as if she is about to go out streaking. 'Swingeing London 67 (f)' is my personal favorite though -- it's two guys on a bus, shielding themselves from the paparazzi.  And that's the story of my perpetual postcard calendar. Stay tuned for more exciting posts...it's a slow day, and I have plenty to say.         "
"           Don't even try to pretend you don't love it, DJS. I can read right through you. I am glad I won't have to listen to the theme music anymore after next week, though. But I can't wait for the big finale -- THREE hours of American Idol in ONE WEEK! Luckily, I have the VMAs to tide me over.  I'm such a teeny-bopper.         "
"           American Idol...what the %@#?  I got suckered into watching the end of it and I so wanted that microphone..er, I'm sorry...Justin to go.  I can't stand the look of that guy, let alone his butchering of every song he gets his Michael Jackson-esqe hands on.  I'm in agreement, though, Panda.  Nikki can't sing and it's clear that Kelly really should win, since she's the only one that's been consistent enough (from what I've seen in the recaps) to belt out something somewhat decent week after week.  So alas, Nikki is gone.  While she was easy on the eyes, her yodeling left much to be desired.  Call me crazy, but I don't think we've seen the last of her.  If she doesn't end up in movies or get her singing chops up to par, I'd be damned.  Honestly, I can't wait until the show ends.  I'm tired of hearing that dumb theme music and seeing that bug-eyed brown-haired idiot nodding every time the Poor-man's Brad Pitt says anything.         "
"           Whoever said I originally let him go?    So I never told you all about my brother's wedding.  It was a blast, but nothing happened that would shock many of you readers out there.

Those Poles sure know how to party!  Her mom was dragging everyone at the reception on the dance floor during the Beer Barrel Polka...and when the DJ played 'Believe' by Cher.    American Idol: If Nikki doesn't get the ax tonight I'll have to seriously reconsider taking up a career in the music biz.  It's obvious you don't need talent.  It seems to me all you need is a belly-button ring and some really shiny lipstick.  Heck, I can do that!         "

My only experience with this medication prior to yesterday was watching Samanthas older sister in Sixteen Candles go nutty on the stuff.  Taking just one makes me feel pretty high, I can only imagine what several would do.  I mean, other men have loved me, but not for six whole months in a row.   By the way - can we can the Rick talk?

I just drank a Diet Pepsi because the other stinkin' soft drink machine (that offers delicious Diet Coke) won't accept my dollar bills.  Trust me, I tried all five that I had.  Since I needed liquid, cafferinated refreshment, I turned to the much-loathed Pepsi machine and it greedily ate my Dead George.  With a sigh, I depressed the DP (that's Diet Pepsi) button and the machine farted out a newly designed can.  Since I don't like to drink out of cans, I scooped some ice into my Uptown Bar pint glass and poured the Diet Pepsi over the rocks.  (Note: If you don't drink your soft drinks in a bar glass while at work, you're truly missing out.)  I choked it down and wished the Coke machine wouldn't have done me wrong.  Friends, it just ain't the same.  Oh...and I'm going to Khan's Mongolian Barbecue for lunch.  Lucky me.         "

Id be thrilled if it was a Tuesday (as long as it didn't interfere with 'Idol' watching), but I don't want to be sick over a weekend!

She gets humiliated every week. I swear they only said nice things to her the other day to keep her from offing herself so she wouldnt have to perform anymore.   I am also very depressed that Tamyra got booted. I know, shes going to move on to a successful career, yadda yadda, but I was excited for the last few episodes, to see her and Kelly battle it out.

First, Seacrest makes out with some woman in the crowd, then the 'Idols' decide to sing a Paula Abdul medley for Ms. Abdul herself (I've heard chimps sing better), and then Tamyra gets kicked off?  What about Nikki?  She needs to have her vocal chords permanently removed as not to cause this nation more pain and suffering.    Nikki, haven't we suffered enough?  Your nervous wink-tick and tears do not fool me.  You still blow.         "

Like most of TV (and I don't want to get on a rant here) American Idol is totally insulting to my intelligence...you know, 'cuz I'm so smart.  I caught a clip of some of the show when my girlfriend was watching it and there was a segment where it showed 'those wacky kids' having fun between rehearsals.  They were being crazy and trying their hand at playing the trumpet.  Of course, no one was able to blow it and make it work right.  Hilarious!  But then...the idiot with the stupid-looking afro (I think, I forget because they're all talentless) drank some Coca-Cola and was able to belt out a chart-topper.  So stupid.  And another thing...don't speak for the whole of America by calling any of these no talent schleps American Idols.  Let us decide who the damn idols are, okay?  Not just the poor slobs who actually call in to vote for this garbage.  Seriously...would you buy a CD if any of them released something?  I'm sorry, I'd rather spend my hard-earned cash on a pencil.  So I could poke out my eardrums.  (take a breath)  Okay...so I'm crabby today.  I've had to train 6 people who had the attention span of a fat lady in a bakery.  Needless to say, I'm a little burnt out.  Today was a long day.  I guess I hope Kelly wins, alright?  :)         "

What's with these kids' parents in the audience?  Particularly, what's with Nikki's parents' T-Shirts?  I'm all for being a 'fan' of your children, but I believe they're wearing a picture on their chests of her half-naked.  And the judges: what a bunch of pretentious a-holes.  Can someone please tell me what that was on Paula Abdul's head last night?  Paula, even though you won a Grammy in the 80's doesn't mean, it  still is  the 80's.    I could go on and on about those 2 ass clowns Seacrest and Dunkleman.  Heck, what I really should go on and on about is how I actually know their names.  I need to get out more.

This Friday night he flies in from NYC and the next AM hes heading straight for the boundary waters.  For this purpose, he needs a paddle.  Lest you figure him to be a poor planner, let me explain.  He has ordered a paddle online from said merchant, but in his words its not here yet, and Im worried it will be too short.  Okayyyyy  To remedy this, he would like me to pick up an alternate paddle at (hated) REI so that he has options when he arrives in Minneapolis.  I will then be returning the rejected paddle to (hated) REI.  Its a simple task, I guess, and Im willing to brave those over-gortexed fools, but brother has another request  pick out not one, but three really nice looking paddles of a specific type, so I can choose among them.  He explained that hes really particular about the wood grain.  Uh-huh.    The saddest thing is, as I retold this tale to Stoner, she pointed out that Im the same way about shoes (and Im pretty sure that that if I bring home another purse, Im breaking the lease, or something).  I had little argument.  Except, that I havent asked anyone to bring the shoe department to me.  Then again, I havent spent much time in New York (apparently).

"           Who ever thought it would be so difficult to find a good, non-cheesy DJ for a wedding?  Billygoat and I were in Wisconsin over the weekend, checking out local vendors for our big day.  We decided to crash some weddings in the area in order to watch the DJs in action.  So to do this, we thought it would be a good idea to get dressed up - you know, to 'fit in.'  What we forgot was that we were in Wisconsin.  Because we dressed up, we  didn't  fit in.  There were guys walking around in tight Levi's, Harley T-shirts, and permed mullets.  There were others in loose khakis and bright white Reeboks.  It was like we had entered some parallel universe of fashion mishaps.  And the DJs sucked, by the way.  I was more impressed by one DJ's disco ball, than by his music.  FYI to all those attending mine - 'Brick House' is on the DO NOT PLAY list.          "
"            I just got to go on a field trip to the Gedney pickle factory to pick up some pickles and  urlLink some of these . Then I got to go to Nicollet Island to look around.   I like days like today.         "
"           I work for a big company, and part of my job is to edit communications pieces. Im always amazed at how many people are involved in the editing process  the easiest, smallest pieces go through at least ten hands, and everyone has something to say.   Today I was even more amazed than usual. Someone is on vacation, so Ive been asked to review the company-wide communications that she looks at on behalf of our business line. There were 132 people on the to: line of this message. Im not kidding. I counted. 132. Each of these people will probably pass it to one or two other people, meaning there are potentially hundreds of small changes that are going to be made to this document.   I am so grateful that is not my job.           "
"           This is billygoat200 here.  Billygoat sans numbers was beginning to wear on me. I guess I got dumped from sasshole so I will have to find release for all my stories here on the pandyland site.  Thank you all for finding me a new home, I feel like a great burden has been gently lifted from my shoulders.  I feel considerably less uptight now that my blog worries are over and my creative juices are running wild.           "
"            Oh, the excitement of working in a suburban office tower.   There was just a car on fire on 394. Flames all over the front end, and black smoke everywhere. We watched the fire trucks come and put it out.   It was very exciting.         "

"            I'm confused - she  doesn't  like Pandyland? She prefers participating in a system where you have to log into email, send a message to someone who may or may not preserve its integrity, and then wait hours upon hours (or even the entire weekend) for the message to appear?   Pandyland is real-time, and I love it.  Heres an update on my weekend: I got to play with Rocky, my parents new puppy, and I found out how he got his name. You might think its an adaptation of our familys last name  but really, its because Rocky eats rocks. And twigs. And pretty much anything else that he can get into his mouth. I was never really too big on pets (you have to feed them or they die), but now I want one.         "
"             News flash...    Sara, some goofy broad on Sasshole, visited this here site and claimed it was a joke.  Please...someone dispatch a crew to burn her house down.  Doesn't she realize that we're in the beginning stages?  Oh...and I did check out Pandy1and.  Confirmation that they just can't get enough of us.  Any slob willing to devote his time to making a (oh, stop me... the comedy is too intense) site (chuckle, guffaw) that's supposed to be (hee hee) like ours (ho ho) is comedy genius.  Purely.  The talent there is staggering.         "
"           Sounds good to me, Shovel.  Tell me when you've found anything out.  Seems like we've gotten under Sass' skin.  Check out pandy1and.blogspot.com.    Clown.         "
"           Yo yo yo...DJ is in the hizzy for rizzy. (Man...I'm such a whitey whitebread)  I also enjoyed a crisp, delicious Diet Coke myself.  I didn't have any money for the soft drink, so I had to borrow a dollar from my girlfriend.  She gladly handed over the legal tender and liquid refreshment was consumed post haste.  Nectar of the Gods, I say.  In other news: I think we should somehow post a Pandyland e-mail address or somehow install a comments feature on this here site so we can give something back to the people.  You know...let them speak their minds if they'd like.  If this sounds agreeable to the rest of the crew, I'll start digging up some info on how we can get it done.  That's how I do...         "

"           Stoner, I am honored by your presence.  Please, make yourself at home.  We are happy to have you on board.  Speaking of consumption of food and drink: I have downed one bottle of Propel (Black Cherry flavor), a Nutri Grain breakfast bar, and a packet of Curious George fruit snacks.  I love sugar.         "
"           I am pleased to announce my arrival at Pandyland!   I am excited about my newfound freedom. My last sass-post attempt was denied  Im not sure, but that could be confirmation of those fascism rumors   What I do know for sure is this: I have consumed one (1) diet coke today.         "
"           I guess I can't seem to avoid trouble lately.  I got myself into a bit of trouble at work.  I took a picture of my boss when we went bowling at our last 'team-building' meeting.  I then decided to submit it and a group photo of our team with a little 'human interest' story to our work newsletter.  This newsletter is distributed globally.  That may not sound too bad until you find out what the picture looked like - it was basically a photo of my boss' ass.  Most people would be able to laugh this type of thing off, but not him.  He's got a major Napolean complex.    The longer and longer I stay within the corporate realm, the more I find out that nobody has a sense of humor anymore. Either that, or I'm not much into 'team building'.           "
"           As some of you may know...I likey the band  urlLink Eels .  I even convinced Hal to part with their first effort 'Beautiful Freak' for a small fee.  The exchange went a little something like this: (hit it)   Shovel  -  I like EELS.    Hal  -  Oh, I have their first album.    Shovel  -  Do you ever listen to it?    Hal  -  Not really.    Shovel  -  I want it.  How much?    Hal  -  One burrito.    Shovel  -  Sold.   If you're not privvy to their music, they're the band who sang 'Novocaine For The Soul' (not my favorite)_but they're kind of like a cross between Cake & Beck...sort of.         "
"           I'm so excited and I just can't hide it I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.  This is the seventh happiest day of my life, to wit:  1.  Day I got married. 2.  Day I became a father. 3.  Day I went to see U2 Live at Red Rocks 4.  Day I had my first Chipotle Burrito 5.  Day I met DJ Heather (and her super cool friends) 6.  Day I became a former sasshole reader  I will be gone next week, then I will post, post and occassionally, post.  Thanks for making me part of the team.  P.S.  Panda, I love your movie reviews! P.S.  Stoner, pithy and brilliant!         "
"           Great.  I thought I would be able post here and there as I please, but already I get the email from Panda... 'get to it!  post away!', exactly 29 minutes after I am invited to join.  Sheesh!           "
"           Hiya.  DJ Shovelpants, here.  Glad to see that there is life after Craphole.com or whatever that sad little site was called.  On a side note: I almost spilled a whole can of Raviolli all over my free March Of Dimes t-shirt.    Close call...         "

"           Sometimes I believe that cheaters prosper.  Sometimes I think that there is no karma and you can do bad things all day long and twice on Sundays and never have bad things happen to you.  Sometimes I hate the world because we could make things so simple, we could be so cool to each other and instead we complicate things and are mean to each other and we (collectively) suck really bad.    Sometimes I feel like we have it set up so that people who are willing to short cut and cheat and mistreat can really get ahead.  Yep, screw people over, make SVP and buy a Lexus:  It's a Wonderful Life.  What's the downside (not a rhetorical question BTW - I really want to know what the downside is to the person who does it.  Do they feel anything?  Do they care or does a giant mansion and a European luxury sedan make it all better?)?  I hope to God that I never understand it. And, in spite of myself, I wish that something really bad would happen to people who do bad things to other people.    I am going (via 10 year old Honda) home (to house that would not pass FHA inspection), and I am going to drink a giant dirty martini (up).           "

"           Duf Fer -- you are not sharing too much, because I have no idea who those people are. I just know that Heather was right and Peggy was very, very wrong.  Now I will share too much.

The CanvasWorks Trunk Show continues through Sunday and the Shelly Trunk Show is coming next.  We have a special treat during the Shelly show - Shelly herself!  Shelly will be in the shop on Saturday, October 12, to assist customers with canvas and fiber selection. Also October 12, knitters can try out our new yarns in the classroom at our Fall Yarn Tasting.  Better mark your calendars! And this Saturday, September 28, Dave Paulson will be at the shop sharpening scissors.  This is a great opportunity to have a professional make your edges like new.  Drop them off anytime before Saturday and they will be ready by 5pm Saturday.'  It was at approximately 4:12 p.m. today that I realized I am kind of a geek.         "

"           Ive actually seen Panda do a duet of Up Where We Belong and I have to tell you  it was truly inspiring.   In other news, I am taking a class on Tuesday nights. Im not giving out the name of the place because I want to tell you about some of the people in my class. And I would feel horrible if they knew I was discussing their quirks on the Internet. Not that they would somehow stumble onto Pandyland, realize I am talking about them, and figure out who I am. But still -- I have paranoia issues.   Back to my story  Im starting to think that this undisclosed organization plants people in their classes in order to boost the confidence of the other students. Because my class has two that are somewhat questionable.   Its a freelance writing class, so on the first day we did the usual interview-the-person-sitting-next-to-you thing. Youd think that in a room full of potential reporters, youd get some pretty straight facts. Not the case with the guy sitting next to me  while introducing me, he went on about how I am there to pursue an advanced degree, and how I publish a journal about insurance and issues relating to insurance, etc. etc.   Neither of these things came out of my mouth  Im definitely not there to pursue an advanced degree because, well, they dont grade you on the classes and dont actually offer any degrees. I did say that I do employee newsletters for an insurance company, so I guess I do see how he could confuse that with an insurance journal. But the nature of what I write for work involves very little objective research  just a lot of pat Bob on the back because he sold a huuuuuuuuge policy!!!! AOW!!!!!   Still, this guy pales in comparison to the lady who I shall now refer to only as Crazy Lady.   On the first day she apologized for being 45 minutes late and having to leave an hour early  our class is two hours long. This week, our assignment was to get writers guidelines from publications wed like to write for. Its a pretty simple task, all it involves is a few minutes on the internet or a few minutes to fill out the addresses on a couple of envelopes. Not a big deal.   When we got around the room to her, she said she didnt do the assignment  and that, quite frankly, she didnt realize this was going to be so much work. When asked who shed like to write for she said  I didnt really think about it. I dont know. I guess  National Geographic . Its always been my dream to be a photographer for  National Geographic . Which doesnt exactly explain why shes in a freelance  writing  class...but hey, whatever works.  Finally, last night there was a reception for some grant winners going on outside the door of our classroom. We all joked around about mingling during break time  but really, we were joking. Crazy Lady, apparently, was not. She came back from break with a glass of wine.   So anywaysthose are my storiesfor now. Im sure I will tell more later.         "
"           I think I will sing something inspirational like 'Up Where We Belong' or the theme song from 'The Great American Hero' (Believe it or not I'm walking on air...).  Either those choices or my favorite: the theme from the 'Golden Girls'.  I have a thing for  urlLink Bea Arthur .          "
"           HAL to boss:  'Hey, Jac-kay, baby I got ya money, doncha worry, Jac-kay.'  Could be your song for PBJ HAL.         "
"           I just went to Taco Bell with my boss, and she tried to pimp me out to a pair of 18 year olds.  Disturbing.         "
"           I would like to sing 'Summer Wine' (the song that is on the 'Corrs Live on VH1' cd, apparently Nancy Sinatra sang it?) just like they do -- as a duet with Bono. I like that song because of its country flair and belt-the-whole-thing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs potential.  If Bono is unavailable that weekend, I suppose I could substitute with something from 'J to tha L-O'...right now it is a toss up between 'Ain't it Funny' and 'It's Gonna Be Alright.' Of course, that will be decided when I find out if Ja Rule is available or not.  Murder, Inc. is tha bomb.           "
"           PBJ...make it so.  Yeah, I think HAL and Stonie should loosen the itinerary a bit so we can all enjoy each other's company.  After all, we've got a SMASH HIT website without the aid of polls, porn, or the tired (and I mean...tiiiiiiiired) notion of booting anyone off.  Let's give ourselves a pat on our back and a burrito in our fat gobs for a job well done.  Splendid work, everyone.  You make this DJ priggity-proud!  Duf - Tomorrow might be tough for a burrito run.  I got the newbies to train, but God-willing, let's make it happen.  Seeing as it's my last day of work for the week, I want to run the clock down any way possible.  Ya know?  Stoner - I can't tell you how many tears leaked out of my head when I opened my DJ Shovelpants e-mail account and saw...NOTHING!!!  Where's that story, dammit?  No pressure, of course.  But Sweet Jesus!!!  I will however sing the extended version of 'Sweet Child O' Mine' at the burrito fest.  If you guys really behave, I might even do the Axl Rose patented Serpentine moves, too.            "
"           Sign me up for the PBJ (Pandyland Burrito Jamboree).  I will sing  Unchained Melody  (more like the Willie Nelson than Righteous Brothers or Elvis).  I can't wait to meet Panda Bear.  I heard so many things.  I mean so many GOOD things. Oh, and Stoner, all god-fearing Americans like pancakes - that's why you got the frowns.   People frown at godless communists all the time.         "
"           I think that everyone should have to sing a song at the first annual Pandyland Burrito Jamboree. I just think that would be a nice touch.  We have a potluck here tomorrow, as part of United Way week. I have to bake something, so it only costs me $2 to participate, rather than $6. I think by the end of the week, I am going to need the United Way because I will be so poor. It's one of those three-weekend paychecks (c'mon, you know what I'm talking about) so it's a stretch already...I got frowns for skipping out on the $3 pancake breakfast today. I don't really like pancakes, so I decided it is my prerogative (as Bobby Brown would say) to skip out. I'm not participating in the cribbage tournament today either. I'm on strike. Okay, and I don't know how to play.  But I must get back to work...my boss just handed me our cookbook to final-double-check to make sure all of the editing was done properly. For the eight millionth time. What was my mantra again? Oh yeah -- 'I don't want to sleep on cardboard, I don't want to sleep on cardboard...'         "
"           Since I am coming to Minneapolis on the weekend of October 12th, I think a Pandyland rendezvous is in order.  But you might have to talk to Hal and Stoner since they are in charge of my itinerary.  I just come along for the ride.          "
"           Ball of confusion That's what the world is today Hey Hey  So last night, I get home from work thinking there is going to be this great anniversary celebration (what is the second anniversary anyway?  Tin?  Paper?  Cash?  I think it is cotton or china) and I find my wife drunk on Grain Belt Premium singing that Dave Edmunds song: 'I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll' out of key at the top of her lungs.  All I can think is 'Geez, I've got 5 more years of this crap?'  She passed out while I was reading her my romantic anniversary poem (called 'Anniversary 2, Electric Boogaloo - Two Dirty Limericks to Honor Our Anniversary').  I ended up watching a bad video tape (static, cut off before the end) of the Emmys - how about that  Everybody Loves Raymond , huh?  Anyway, it was not the anniversary I imagined:  some celebration.    I guess that's only funny for people who know my wife.  For those that don't, I have never seen her drunk, but she cannot say the same of me (hiccup).  Stoner, quit your job and hit the road Kerouac style.  Title your book 'On the Road Again.'  Make it stream of consciousness.  You'll need an oil change (every 3,000 miles) for your (quiet) Toyota.  Maps, and lots of drugs (preferably hallucinogens, but maybe Ecstacy to make it a version for the new millenium).  Of course, you'll need corporate sponsors (a certain large national bank comes to mind).    But, Stoner, mainly I wanted to say this:  in the words of Bachman Turner Overdrive (BTO to those in the know) I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you:  tonight.  Expect delivery tomorrow after work.  PB:  I'm am the world's biggest Cheesecake fan.  I also had a non-traditional wedding cake at my wedding - Kranzakake (Norwegian snack cake for holidays and weddings) - and either it was a big hit or everyone lied and said that it was.  Don't invite me to your wedding (my wife has problems with the sauce), but save me a piece of cake.  DJS - sorry about lunch today. What's the haps for tomorrow?  Buh-Ree-To? Lemmeknow. When are we having our Pandyland Burrito Jamboree?  HAL - let's shop soon, but not for shoes.  Billygoat - what gives, too gruff to post?         "
"           You'll have to ask the 'rents about the open bar plan since that's their gig.  I'm all for it, but I'm also for keeping things reasonably priced, which an open bar doesn't help with.  All I know at this point: there will definitely be all the top-notch booze you can drink available during the cocktail hour before dinner.  The goal: drink as many drinks as you can, as fast as you can.    That sounds like the games we used to play at Plum's on Thursday nights.  Look forward to a Billygoat post soon.  I heard rumors that he may get close to a computer this evening...         "
"           I feel like a loser that I wasnt in the short-story contest like everyone else, though I had a nice weekend regardless.  It got a little surreal when on Saturday night I found myself at a friends cabin watching the Miss America pageant.  Please, will someone put this contest out of its misery?  I say this not out of feminist outrage (I personally think there are bigger fish to fry), but because its just sad.  Not even so-good-its-bad, or Fastlane-bad.  Just sad.  Though not quite as sad as waiting for someone you are 'fighting' with to surf over to your web log.  Panda, I like the cheesecake idea, but lets get to the part of the wedding that everyone REALLY cares about  will it be an open bar? :)         "
"           I haven't been able to post much lately. It seems that either a) the internet is down at work, b) I am being forced to proofread recipes, or c) I am repeating 'you can't quit your job, or you will have to live on the street' over and over in my head, which means I haven't had much time for Pandyland.  But I did manage to take that brat packer quiz. I am sad to report I came up as Long Duck Dong. Embarassing.  Y'all can read my story if you want...it's a little strange to have people want to read something I wrote, because I don't write many stories -- I just write in my journal, which I'm sure you all would find WAY more interesting, but that's too bad, you can't read it. Posting it seems a little weird though. It's less than 900 words (per the contest's instructions) but still...kind of a long post. And it's on my home computer anyways. And the dog (or mouse) might eat it by the time I get home, you just can't ever tell...  I heard our crazy neighbors fighting last night. All I caught was 'You're crazy! And angers me! Take it down this instant!' which I can only assume is referring to the notes she has posted on the door to keep the window washers away (it's been a month now).   Duf -- I have reviewed my copy of the burners code of ethics. Your cookies are on the way. BTW, I am v. sad to hear that the Jack Johnson show at First Ave sold out really fast, which means we can't go.   Panda -- I *love* cheesecake. I can't wait to go to your wedding.   DJS -- I want to do another quiz.   Hal -- I want to play Stratego later.  Billygoat -- I miss you.          "
"           DJS, you are right on the money about craphole.com...not only are their posts ridiculous-o, but that idiot Sara thinks our site is the mock site that Mr. Crap had painstakingly made eons ago.  She's a real piece of work.  So I was in Wisconsin again over the weekend...more wedding stuff.  We got to taste the wedding cake.  Postitively delicious!  I broke out of the mold and am making her bake me a 3-layer cheesecake.  It may not be as pretty as the traditional dessert, but it sure tastes damn good.   I saw the movies  Signs  and  One Hour Photo  over the weekend.  I may post a review(s) later, but to make a long story short: We saw  One Hour Photo  first, thought it was terrible, and then decided to sneak over to see  Signs  to try and get our money's worth.   Signs  was good, but not great, so I guess that's better than a sharp stick in the eye...and watching  One Hour Photo  again.  DJS and Stoner - whenever you're ready, post your stories.  Now I'm curious.         "
"           I think I might have to wait to post my story on this here site.  I'm not saying that I would win, but if by some freak of nature, I did...then that could spell trouble.  You know, rights and what-not.    Wow...what a coinky-dink that Stoner was in the same contest.   Stoner - I'd love to read your story.  Do you want to share it with a fellow writer-type (me)?  If so, please send it to:  djshovelpants@yahoo.com .  I'll do the same if you want to read my contest effort.  Another guy I know entered the contest as well.  It's weird to see what people do with the topic (which I wasn't a big fan of).  IMHO is: In My Humble Opinion.  For more crazy abbreviations or code words, visit  urlLink Urban Dictionary.com .  They've got all the crazy lingo there.         "
"           Shovelpants, Stoner participated in the self same short story contest.  It was good that I did not do it.  I would have won all the money.    I am reading your story now DJS - people like Miller High Life:  it is the Champagne of Beers.  Excellent story.  I loved the surprise ending with the clever twist.  I think you and Stoner should post your stories here.  Panda, what does IMHO stand for?  Am I totally clueless?           "
"           Not a bad weekend on my end, either.  The key word was:   relax  .  Since we're moving out of our de-luxe apartment in the sky-high-high this coming weekend, I didn't want to do a whole heckuva lot.  I beat Super Mario Sunshine, ran some errands, went to Stillwater with my girl, and I participated in a 24 hour short-story contest.  As an added bonus, I got to watch the newest episode of the Sopranos.   Duf  - I thought the Polara album was pretty decent.  Of course, that's listening to it here at work, where I'm plenty distracted, so...  I might have to give 'er another spin or two.  I do like that tune they've got playing on the radio, however.  Happy anniversary!  I guess I've got to pay my dues, I thought your wife would 86 you a long time ago because of your mad penchant for DVD/CD purchases.  By the by...I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow.  You in?  On another note: I accidentally popped over to Sasshole.  Man...they've still got a bunch of lame-o's pretending to post interesting things.

"           I have to say it was a good weekend.  I watched tons of college football; I teed it up with a local DJ/Turntablist (who is playing quite well lately (on the course and on the wheels of steel)), and I took the cold (achoo!) my daughter had last week!   I want to take a moment to plug the new  Polara  album  Jetpack Blues .  They are a local band, and their disc is outta site/dy-no-mite (although I am not so sure DJ Shovelpants liked it).  Let me know if you want me to burn it - which reminds me of something I'm going to do for Stoner.  I will burn, but I have a burners code of ethics that you must agree to.  Tonight is my anniversary.  To those who thought we would never last:  ha!  Those who bet 1 year, 364 days on the over/under:  pay up suckas!    Stoner:  how was the contest?         "

Sadly, you keep your feelings bottled up and almost lose the guy.  You are a great kisser.

"           Wow, I didn't think I would get such a rebuttal.  You coulda just said something like 'hey, non-network tv ain't all that bad' and I would have been pacified.  Thanks for the play-by-play.  I don't have HBO (or even standard cable), therefore TV viewing for me is unfortunately limited to Network stations.  Billygoat grew up without a TV at all - my parents actually had to explain to him what they meant by the saying 'sometimes we are so 'Ozzie & Harriet'.'  [Anyone who knows Appleton, WI knows it's pretty close to a real-life 'Pleasantville.']  It's funny the perspective he has on things, having never watched TV as a child.  I'd say he's more creative than most, he loves to read, & doesn't ever feel 'the itch' because he's missing a show.  Since I'm already sick of explaining things like who each character is on Friends or how Wheel of Fortune  always  comes on at 6:30pm, I highly doubt that after we're married we will be watching TV at all.  It's hard to teach an old dog new shows.         "
"           Okay Panda, let me clear the air about the whole TV thing.  I've got the unfortunate 'sit-chee-ay-shun' where our living room is right smack dab next to the bedroom.  When the girlfriend is watching TV: (Alias, reruns of 90210, American Idol, parts of Fastlane and tons of other uh, stuff) I have no choice but to see some of it. After realizing that it's just as bad as everything else, I retire to the study and read. Yeah, it's sad.  It's not that I think I'm above quality shows shown to you piecemeal with rotten commercial interruptions every five minutes or so...heck no.  I like some TV, I just hate MOST of it.  That's all.  For the record, I can't watch more than an hour of network television without complaining and feeling my brain start to melt.  I DO however, have a deep, deep love of some of the HBO shows.  I'm talking your Sopranos (best show, ever!), Dennis Miller Live, and I'll admit it...I like Sex & The City.  Can you say Kristin Davis?  Yep...I can.  But, for your consideration, here are some shows I'll watch without wanting to commit a homicide:   1.  The Sorpanos  2.  Insomniac (Comedy Central)  3.  Real TV  4.  The Simpsons  5.  The Daily Show (rarely, these days)  6.  The Osbournes  7.  Sex & The City  8.  The Dennis Miller Fun Hour  9.  Crank Yankers  (Jesus...I couldn't even come up with 10!)   A note:  The only show I actually seek out and set aside time to watch is The Sopranos, everything else is stuff that while I'm surfing, I might stop on and watch a bit, but I don't set my clock, arrange my meals, or storm out of public places in a blind fury to watch.  Wow...I need to lighten up, eh???          "
"           I just caught a bit of Bono on Oprah this morning.  We snuck into our conference room and I made someone hold the bunny ears while I watched so the reception was good.  Oprah called in to a radio station when Bono was in town a couple days ago.  Supposedly she took him out for dinner after the night of the taping.  They went to Rosebud...I walk past that place at least once a week...why not that day?  It's probably for the best, though.  If I would have seen him it would have turned pretty ugly.    On a side note: I was wondering about Shovel's supposed 'hatred' towards television.  It seems to me whenever anyone comments about a show on TV, Shovel seems to know ALL about it.  IMHO, I think he's a 'closet watcher.'  And I don't buy the argument 'Oh, my girlfriend was watching, so I just  had  to sit there for several hours too.'  C'mon DJS...fess up!  You love TV!          "
"           Thanks for the pipe, DJS. :)  I should clarify my earlier statement.  I didn't say that Fastlane was good, I just said I enjoyed it.  If he was a poor man's Tom Cruise, the show would be unwatchable.  But the fact that he's a  POOOOR Man's  Tom Cruise made it enjoyable.  For me.  I won't be taping it (God, I hope not - it would mean that my TV habit is truly out-of-hand), but I have a feeling I'll be finding myself laughing at it from time to time.  As Stoner put it, 'this show is Melrose!!'.  Well put.          "
"           I couldn't watch more than 2 minutes of Fastlane.  That dude with the hair is like a poor (and I mean POOOOOR) man's version of Tom Cruise.  Just thought I'd pipe up.  Pipe.         "
"           Wow.  Thanks for sharing, Panda... that guy is my new hero.  I lack the stamina.  I saw  urlLink this show  last night, and enjoyed it.  That frightens me.          "
"           Just when I thought the 'Around-the-World' trip Billygoat and I are taking was a good idea, I find something  urlLink  better .  This guy is friends with Anna Marie (for those of you out there that know AM).    All I have to say is: BRILLIANT.  God bless Mike Walsh and God bless bowling.         "
"           I have to go to Cleveland... I just heard that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is going to have a special U2 exhibit starting in early 2003... it's like my dream come true, or something.         "
"           Billygoat comes back from Cleveland today.  Yay!  In other news, I just ate a packet of Sour Skittles and am jumping around all over the place.  Seriously, I just showed my coworker a reenactment of Mike Tyson biting your arms off in the classic Nintendo game 'Mike Tyson's Punchout.'    In case you're wondering, you can play it for free  urlLink here .         "
"           To all you suckerheads who don't live in Chicago:  BONO IS IN TOWN TODAY.  He is going to be on Oprah on Friday and the taping is today.  Supposedly he was at the Stones show last night at the Aragon and sang with the band.  Cross your fingers....perhaps I'll run into him on Michigan Ave.  I hope I don't faint or something.          "
"           Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).  My own rodent-removal procedure consisted of hysterical calls to our apartment management company (creatively called Apartment Management Company).  The woman with the lucky job of answering the phones there calmly explained to me that the mouse will eat the poison put out by the exterminator and then leave your apartment to die.  I wasnt quite sold with that premise as Id think a mouse would choose to die in the plush environs of our apartment versus venturing out into the world for one last adventure, but since we have several senior citizens in our building, this lady gets must get away with such tall tales on a regular basis.  Whatever.  To further complicate all this, Ive seen too many Tom & Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, and even Micky Mouse cartoons to begin to think that its a done deal that the mouse will eat the poison, no matter how enticing.  Im nervous that left to its own devices, the little bastard will sneak the poison in my morning coffee and hit me over the head with a giant anvil.   So now that weve confirmed that the only residents of apartment 205 are Stoner and myself, I can look forward to a pleasant weekend.  *sigh*  Further housing lowdown I caught a bit of  urlLink Rear Window  recently, and it has me even more suspicious of the clowns across the hall.  Im determined to figure out whats up  so far my sleuthing has uncovered the fact that they keep their mini-blinds nearly closed a lot of the time.  Ill keep you updated.          "
"           Hey...I got no shame, I'd do it.  I'll eat AND get my toesies done.  Hell, yeah.  Which reminds me of something...  Back when I was dating a complete psycho, she used to get a kick out of painting my big ol' Fred Flintstone feet.  I didn't care, since you know...what else did I have to do, so I let her, we both laughed and I kind of forgot about it.  I mean...REALLY forgot about it.   Cut to:   Time:  2 Days Later     Scene:  Bloomington Karate Center  I used to be quite the avid kickboxer (and no, I don't look like John Cusack from Say Anything) and as such, I'd get suited up, hop in the ring and pound all kinds of fools into paste.  I had a bit of a reputation as being a bruiser.  As a shorter, stockier guy I could move quick and hit pretty gosh-darn hard.  Well, imagine my absolute horror when I began to strap my footpads on and saw...  Pink Glitter Nail Polish.  Like a trooper, I fought anyway and avoided the odd glances I got from some of the other clowns, but I removed it quickly once I got home.  I used the old 'Oh, my girlfriend did that' routine.  They would just nod and go...'Uh-huh, yeah...'  Ah...good times, good times.         "
"           That sounds delightful!  Even though I never met the Shovel, I think I would thoroughly enjoy seeing him get his toenails painted.          "
"           That's funny -- I was just thinking the Pandyland staff should go out for manis and pedis when Panda is in town. Don't you agree?         "

"           Panda - your Bill story is classic, and informative.  Ill have to keep the silverfish idea in mind for our neighbors across the hall as a defensive measure, of course.  I thought I had good Bill stories, but yours takes the cake.  And Stoner, stop with the quiz fixation, already.  You have one alter-ego, and its Coco.  If you want to nickname it Kylie or Mallrats every once and awhile, thats fine.  But a rose by any other name is still a rose.  Or a Coco.  Im overdue to comment on the upcoming U2 release  I hope youre sitting down, but Im excited about it.  Not as excited as I am about an album of all-new material, but rest assured, Ill be picking it up on the first day of release (or midnight the night before, if possible).  Its been a long week already, and todays anniversary isnt helping any.  Tonight Stoner and I are going to Steens house for drinks (that sounds better than to drink, doesnt it?) and its a welcome diversion.  They have an occasional bat problem, but I have mice, so I cant throw stones.  Maybe VH1 will replay the show (a whole hour long!) Stoner and I watched last night about 'Booty'.  We should be so lucky.          "
"           This makes me very happy...   urlLink     Which female artist from my Cd collection are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla            "
"           Aw...thanks, Stoner.  I wasn't sure if my feeble contributions meant much.  But (dab, dab) I guess they do.  Keep this under your hat, but I'm currently teaching myself how to make them-there quizzes.  I hope to 'roll out' my new quiz on Pandyland here in the next week or so.  It should be absolutely amazing.  Well...probably not, but...         "
"           DJS, I like to read your Soft Drink site. And I take all of the quizzes -- I forgot to weigh in on that before -- I LOVE quizzes. So anyways, this is what I just found out:    urlLink      take the test here     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla  .     I've got to go out and shake it.            "
"           That story sounds oddly familiar...Billygoat and I thought my silverfish were coming from Bill, the guy across the hall from me.  Here is his story:  I first ran into Bill in the elevator when I was doing my laundry.  He's this huge, bald, gay man.  Picture Mr. Clean with a lisp.  When you first see him you think 'This guy is going to totally kick my ass' until you hear him say something like 'Oh, I just *love* your shoes.'  So I thought he was just a bit eclectic.  He even offered to give me his XBOX because he said he never used it.  Sweet, right?  Until I found out he was completely schizophrenic.  I started running into him in the hallway at weird times.  He would look at me strangely until I finally asked him what was up.  Bill asked me stuff like 'Did you knock on my door the other night?' or 'Did you hear that pounding before?'  I, of course, answered 'no' to both of these questions.  He then told me something that was really wacko.  'Someone was pounding incessantly on my door last week so I went to the door but no one was there.  When I looked at your door across the hall, I saw shadows of feet under the door.'  I quickly responded, 'Wait a second, bud.  I wasn't even in town last week.'  (the ol' NYC alibi)  But Bill insisted... 'The cops are after me (I'm a drug dealer, but just a *little* drug dealer) and so I think that they have someone watching me who is using your apartment as a hideout.'  WTF??  I told him I appreciated the 'heads up', and I would look out for him and the mysterious door-knocker.  Translation:  'I will continue to dead bolt my door and avoid you at all costs, you freakshow.'  So last week he finally moved out.  More like got KICKED OUT.  It turns out he never paid any of his bills (and I thought drug dealing was a lucrative profession) and he started to use the outlet we had in our hall to plug in HIS ENTIRE APARTMENT.  No lie, I tripped over his extension chord everytime I went to my apartment.  It was pretty funny, though, since I hate the management company for my building and he was really socking it to 'em.  But still, the guy was nuts.  So that's why I have silverfish.         "
"           For the record, our apartment is spotless (except for the peanut butter that is probably now all over the place, thanks to our old-fashioned mousetraps).   We think the vermin has something to do with the people across the hall. They're very suspicious -- about two weeks ago, window washers were going into each apartment to wash the windows. There were signs posted everywhere telling us that our apartments would be entered, and our windows would be washed. This prompted the neighbor lady to hang a number of things on her door, including: 1) a doorknob hanger that says 'do not disturb', 2) a copy of the fax she sent to the apartment management company, requesting that she not be disturbed because she is working on a very important civil court case and just does not have time for this 3) a copy of the letter she sent -- via certified mail -- telling the window washer place that her apartment is not to be disturbed, 4) notes for the 'independent contractor window washers' in case they somehow missed the message that this apartment is not to be disturbed. This stuff is still hanging on their door, even though the window washers have been done with our floor for almost two weeks now. I've been a little too scared to read everything that is posted, because I don't want them to jump out, grab me, and pull me into their scary apartment. Hal thinks it is a human chop shop.   ANYWAYS, that's why we think there is a mouse around...because of the dead bodies.         "
"           Well, while we're on the subject...  My girlfriend is a clean-freak.  When I think our apartment is spotless, she thinks it's filthy.  So...  She was going to have a bunch of her friends over for a 'girls night' where they'd drink, watch chick flicks, talk about make-up or whatever... the works.  The bottom line?  My presence wasn't requested, so I hung out with my parents and such.  In preparation for Girl Fest 2002, she cleaned the place, top to bottom until you could eat off of the floor.  The girls came over, I was no where to be found, life was good.  Wrong.  I got a call on my cell phone around 9:15pm and she was a little excited.  It seems that a bat had managed to get into our lovely Uptown apartment (a first, by the way) at the most opportune of times.  The lessons?  Clean doesn't always = vermin-free & sometimes it's not a good idea to kick me out of the apartment for the night.         "
"           So I was thinking of visiting Hal and Stoner in Minneapolis, but now it seems I may have to reconsider.  Vermin?  Do you guys need me to clean your place or what?  I should talk, though.  Just when I thought I had my silverfish problem under control...I find another sneaky bastard on my window sill.  Drat!         "
"           RED ALERT!  Hal and I have a mouse in our apartment.   We're terrified.         "
"            DJS, probably better that I missed lunch.  I could get myself in trouble with sharing office gossip...  And as far as video game obsession, I thought I would tell you that I too was addicted to one of the many Mario game some years ago (this is before I had to go to 'group' for Tetris issues).  Somehow, I don't think that letting you know that you share a problem that commonly affects adolesent girls will help.  So I won't tell you that.         "
"           DJS, I've been there. I've felt your pain. In the 7th grade, I became horribly addicted to The Legend of Zelda. I wanted to win so badly. I remember dreaming about the game, and thinking about it during that last hour of school -- then rushing home to play until I had swimming practice. Thank goodness for organized sports, or I could have become a tech person or something. Ew. Instead, I decided to purse a career in marketing. What does that mean? Well, today me and the rest of my department are formatting recipes to put into a cookbook to sell during United Way week. Literally -- it's cut, paste, format, repeat. It's kind of depressing when you think about it -- that in theory, we're donating probably $3000-5000 worth of time and printing costs to raise maybe $300. But I guess that is better than nothing...         "
"           HAL: That stuff about the drunken slob was comedy gold.  I miss all the good stuff.  If you join us at Khan's today, I'd like to hear more stories from the trenches.  I have a confession to make.  I'm a  Super Mario Sunshine  junkie.  Yes.  I need to clean out the closet on this as it's gotten out of hand.  Ever since playing the demo for the new Nintendo Gamecube game, featuring everyone's favortie mustachioed plumber, I knew I needed to have it for myself.  I plotted, I schemed and somehow I convinced my girlfriend that along with a new entertainment center, desk, and chair for our townhouse, our new home wouldn't be complete unless we had a Gamecube and the Super Mario game.  We bought it yesterday.  Sweet Christ.  I should've known this would happen.  Now, since I don't watch a lot of TV, I whittle my idle hours playing video games.  The wit of Seinfeld escapes me.  I want Frasier dead.  Don't get me started on American Idol.  Televised sports?  Sorry friends...no.  I'm almost 30 and a guy, so I usually play video games with guns and cars and all kinds of mayhem.  Not this time.  I'm a chubby plumber chasing mushroom-headed little guys, collecting coins, and spraying plants with water.  If you were to stand outside my apartment door, you'd hear the Super Mario music, the noise it makes when he jumps and the 'ching, ching' of collecting items needed to free the princess or whatever the hell it is I'm supposed to do.  Help me.  I was tired last night.  My girlfriend went to bed around 9pm and I should've followed suit.  It was hot and miserable and I really could've used the sleep.   Getting the 8th red coin could've waited until a more reasonable hour.  I mean...I own the machine and game.  It's not like it's going anywhere.  At around 12:30am...I crawled into bed: red-eyed, sweaty and jumpy.  I must've looked like a crack addict.  I woke up this morning thinking of excuses to not come into work today.  Did I want to take care of some errands that needed taking care of?  No.  Did I have an appointment?  No.  Was I thinking I could catch up on writing my book?  No.  I wanted to play the stupid game.  Damn you Mario.         "

"           Greetings from So-Cal.  Writing to you cordless!!  Im here for some meetings and theyve been fine.  Tonight the real entertainment began at our celebration dinner to celebrate a less than successful rollout, but it would be bad to not have the dinner that usually follows such rollouts, so whatever.  A certain celebrant decided that celebration dinner translates in idiot as you should be drunk.  Examples include when we had ordered our own desserts and then he said bring out another 3 or 4 tiramisus to share.  Uh, there were only 9 of us, and we had all just ordered what we wanted.  Throughout dinner, when someone finished their drink, he would order another one for them.  They wouldnt know it till another (unwanted) new drink appeared in front of them.  My boss (a vegan) joined the table only to have him helpfully point her our to the waiter by yelling, SHES THE VEGAN.  Im sure the other patrons appreciated this info.   After dinner, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot appeared, and he yelled THIS IS ON ME, THIS IS A CELEBRATION FOR CRISSAKES!  I LIKE TO LIVE LIFE.  Uh, okay but the best was at the very end, when a few people had filtered out.  He cornered the two business sponsors and resident corporate bigwigs and told them I DONT UNDERSTAND OUR BUSINESS MODEL  IT IS GOING TO FAIL.  I KNOW THE BROKERAGE INDUSTRY LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND, AND WERE GOING TO FAIL.  Mind you, were not in the brokerage industry  Cue exit of everyone with the exception of Mr. My-resignation-is-forthcoming we left him at the restaurant as he told us I JUST SAW MY FRIEND  HE WANTS TO FINISH THE BOTTLE WITH ME  We re-convene tomorrow morning at 8am.  Hope he makes it.          "

"           Billygoat has officially moved out of his place and out of Chicago.  No more sweet location off of Michigan Ave to brag about for him.  He can no longer bring chicks over to try and impress them with his Chicken Candle and Whale Bone altar.  Instead, he's spending his days taking care of his grandfather in Cleveland.  This entails trying to hide chocolate from him (last week grandfather ate an entire bag of Hersey's minibars) and taking the phone away (a couple days ago he called 911 and the cops came to the house - maybe he called because he ran out of chocolate?).    Running out of sweets would definitely be an emergency for me.  I love sugar way too much.  I have a bag of Jelly Bellies sitting on my desk that are calling my name.  Gotta go!           "
"           I had the honor of golfing with Hal and Bobo le Clown this weekend. I never really liked golfing  but this time I had fun! Hal and Bobo are good people to golf with. They dont get mad if you hit it on the wrong fairway and decide you can pick it up and play it from wherever you want. Afterwards, I had three tall, cool glasses of Diet Coke. What a refreshing experience!         "
"           Oh man...I miss all the cool dirt while I'm out of the office, including the cake stampede.  I swear, when sack of trash behind the front desk sends out an e-mail letting us know the birthday cake for the month hath been unleashed, the people in floor below us must wonder where we suddenly got a charging head of cattle.  It's like they've never had cake before...or eaten befoe or something.  So HAL...lay it on me.  What happened with uh...Jan?         "
"           I just had the most terrifying experience.  I visited the link Panda put on there.  That Peter Pan guy frightens the living shit out of me.    I was going to post the following little Halloween story on Soft Drink, but since it's collapse, I've got no choice but to put it here.  Sorry. -----  Holly-ween   In October of 1996, I moved from Minnesota to California to pursue a career working in film and what-not.  At the time, I was married, but my uh...wife wasn't going to move out until November.  I basically had a month to 'set-up' camp.  After struggling for a week without work, I landed a job working on the set of Dante's Peak.  It was a crappy volcano movie...you don't remember it.  Since I was alone and had nary a friend, some clowns at work invited me to a Halloween party.  I thought:  Sure.  I can rub elbows with some big shots and maybe get in good for the next film crew they set up.   Of course I needed a costume and I didn't have one.  Time to hit the stores.  I bought a nun costume.  I know it's lame to do nowadays, but back then I had a real thing about being religious people.  I've been Moses (complete with Ten Commandments) Jesus Christ, and a nun.  But I wasn't going to be any ordinary nun.  No sir.  I bought some additional accessories for my get-up.  Once I was back at my dumpy apartment, I got dressed for the big night.  I hit the streets dressed as a cigar-smoking nun wearing combat boots, wearing an eyepatch and sporting a tommy gun.  It was so cool, and I looked so stupid.  I drove way out into the valley to go to this party and since I'd only been there a couple weeks anyway, it wasn't an easy chore to find.  Luck was on my side and I got there in full effect.  I saw the costumes other people were wearing and I smacked myself in the forehead.  I worked with the Special FX department at Digital Domain and EVERYONE was wearing really elaborate costumes.  It made me want to cry.  I looked like a cheap, stocky nun with shitty accessories.  Shame on me.  The only way to get over this, of course, was to drink.  So I drank.  And drank.  And driz-ank.  Sometime over the course of the evening, I befriended a crippled pirate and exchanged quips with a docile Frankenstein's Monster. (it's true! click  urlLink HERE ) I was out of my skull drunk.  Take how drunk HAL was at Pandyland Burrito Jamboree and multiply it by 8.  I was drunk.  I could smell booze coming out of my pores.  People were holding their mugs beneath my sweaty nun robes to fill their cups.  Drunk.  I had such a great time, I must've sat down to absorb the atmosphere.  The whole party was outside on a patio decortated all spooky-like.  I sat in a lawn chair and laughed, shot people with my fake gun and had a blast.  Cut to tomorrow morning.  I woke up and I had no idea where I was.  I was sitting in someone's backyard on a rickety lawn chair.  I looked down and saw that I was wearing a black dress and had some kind of dumb scarf thing on my head.  On my lap was a plastic cigar.  In one hand, I held onto an empty plastic cup that smelled like beer.  In the other hand, I was gripping a plastic Thompson machine gun.  What in the sweet name of Christ happened to me?  The sun was out, there was dew on the grass and I had no idea where I was or how I'd gotten there.  The Halloween party had been taken down and no one bothered to wake me up. I promptly stood up, staggered through the stranger's lawn and began to look for my car.  Best Halloween ever, man.  HAPPY HALLOWEEN Pandyland!!!         "
"           Today I had a terrifying experience.  One of the guys I work with came to the office dressed as one of the Village People.  And I thought Britney Spears was the only one who thought that was cool.  I'm reminded of last year when Billygoat and I dressed up as Tinkerbell and Peter Pan for Halloween.  Billygoat in tights...it must have been love.  At least he wasn't as feminine as  urlLink this guy .           "
"           Yesterday I had a terrifying experience.  I walked by two 8 year olds walking home from school, and they were both on cell phones.  Happy Haloween, Heather         "
"           Dear Duffer,  What happened yesterday?  Signed,  Stoner         "
"            Have you ever had one of those days where some things go incredibly right (you get an unforeseen pay raise no where near your review date, and you get a traffic ticket thrown out) and some things go incredibly wrong too (you're sick, your company loses a key account, there are struggles at home)?  Well, I had such a day yesterday.           "
"            Stoner,  Congratulations!  I can't wait to read your stuff, and I really can't wait for that point in the future when I can say 'I knew her when...'           "
"           AND  I have another story.   After a particularly bad day last week, I applied for a few jobs through Monster as therapy. I got a call for an interview today.   Im starting to think I should go play the lottery.          "
"           Um - I gave that magazine an idea for another story, and guess what. They want that one too!   I have my first real official assignment, and they are going to send me a contract and everything! I am now really, truly, a gosh-darned freelance writer. I am so proud I could explode.  I have to get one of those bowler hats with the little 'press' thingie in it.         "
"           Greetings, Pandyland!  As Panda mentioned, I'm currently in NYC staying with my bro/sis-in-law (aka 'my peeps') for the week.  Last evening Panda and I walked by a trendy-looking bar at about 5:30pm.  There were a few people inside, baracades at the ready outside, and big promotional posters for a certain heartthrob's new CD by the entrance.  Seems we had stumbled upon a party for Nick Carter (aka a Backstreet Boy and Britney's rumored new squeeze for those not in-the-know).  We flirted with the idea of waiting a few hours for the chance to scream at Nick and his party people as they arrived to celebrate his fantastic new release.  But then we went into a non-trendy bar around the corner and had beers.  I don't regret our choice (yet).  While here, I've been enjoying the HBO provided by my hosts.  I saw the Sopranos (yes, it's great) and it was weird to see it only a day after it originally aired.  I'm used to being way behind on it (and Sex in the City, too) as I catch it on DVD.  More importantly, I've finally seen 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.  HILARIOUS!  Now I know what Duf has been talking about!!!  More updates to follow.  Congrats, Stoner!!          "
"           This just in...  The contest winners for that short story thingy Stoner and I entered.  Visit this  urlLink link  to see who won and more importantly...who didn't.  I think it was rigged.         "
"           Just to let y'all know - HAL is here in NYC!  We just went to lunch.  What a nice surprise!  Of course, she's a little too 'busy' to spend any evenings with the founder of Pandyland.  I had big plans for the girl and got shot down.  Ouch!  Yes, DJS, I went to see Dancer in the Dark...twice.  Billygoat was the one who cried like the little beyotch he is.  Crocodile tears.  Stoner, the only reason I knew that was a Laffy Taffy joke was because I love candy almost as much as you do.  And obviously I buy them for the candy, not the laugh-potential.             "
"            Stoner:  I'm so proud of you I just don't know what else to say.  That's awesome!!!  Hurray for you!  Who's your agent?  Do they publish Children's Books?  'Cause I've got one, you know...  All seriousness aside, I should point out that tomorrow we should find out who won the 24 Hour Short Story Contest both Stoner and myself entered.  I'm hoping to win all the money.   Panda:  Despite what that Bono-nut HAL says, Selmasongs is a damn good album.  Of course, I'm guessing you've seen the movie.  I don't want to sound like a panty-waist, but I cried like a little beyotch.  It's probably one of the best films...EVER.   Duf:  Sorry about Soft Drink.  Can you find it in your heart to forgive?   HAL:  Where are you?         "
"           Panda, you are so smart. That  was  off a laffy taffy wrapper.   In other news, I am so proud of myself! In my writing class, I wrote an essay about swimming. I sent it to a little magazine here in town, called Twin Cities Sports. And do you know what? I think they just might print it. They said probably  but first I will have to make it a little longer.   I have not yet counted any chickens, but I am still very excited!         "
"           That sounds like some lame-o joke off of a Laffy Taffy wrapper.         "
"           Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!         "
"           A bird that buries its head in mashed potatoes!!!         "
"           I guess I need to ask:  What?         "
"           What do you get when you cross a turkey and an ostrich?         "
"           And to have a hostile dentist on your hands is a very dangerous situation indeed!           "
"           Panda Bear,  I did not know you were a dentist!  Signed,  Duf         "
"           It's about time I openly bashed the company I work for.  I highly doubt anyone who works here reads this anyway, so it probably doesn't matter if it's proclaimed here or not.  DDS sucks.  Today I was told I am 'hostile' and that I 'need to take control of [my] own career.'  I should not wait until someone delegates work to me.  Anyone who knows me  at all  knows that I'm the LAST person on earth to wait to take action.  I'm laughing my ass off right now.  Anyone in the Twin Cities need a maid?  Cleaning toilets would be better than the shit I take here.  Pardon the non-intended pun.         "
"           Hey kids...rock n' roll, rock on...etc.  Well, I got sick on Wednesday and here I am back at work a changed man.  After diagnosing that I really abuse my stomach with some of my dining choices, I've decided that I'm going caffiene free.  Can you believe it?  Not only am I NEVER eating Asian food again, but my days of delicious Diet Coke are behind me.  *sigh*  Today marks the fourth day I've gone without that precious natural resource.  Did I go through withdrawals?  Yes.  Did I get crazy headaches that lasted a 1.5 days?  Yes.  Have I kicked the habit?  It appears that I have.  So...alas, I'm different already because of this.  Not that this is a bad thing, but I'm not NEARLY as hyper as I used to be. CK 2 even commented that she can see the change in me.  Jesus...what was I like before?  My new beverage of choice?  Water.  Yep.  Water.  Not nearly as exciting or effervescent, but it's for my own good.  Poop.           "
"           i-e-i-e-i-e-i-i         "
"            Why can't you do it? Why can't you set your monkey free? All it takes is a little doing. Do you want the monkey or do you want me?         "
"           Anyone who knows me pretty well knows that I love monkeys.  My brother gave me an 'adopt-an-orangutan' kit for a present and now I am the proud mother of a funny looking monkey in Borneo named 'Einstein.'  I also love that Sprint PCS commercial highlighting the 'monkey with a cold.'  No, not a 'movie that is old.'  How cute is he with those Kleenexes?  Pretty darn cute.  Before the Snipers were caught, Billygoat and I commented on the $15 or so million they were asking for ransom money.  We thought the people of Maryland could have a fund raising activity...perhaps a 'Bowling for Snipers' telethon. People could take pledges and then the Sniper would get one of those big, monstrous checks like they give away for Publisher's Clearing House.  But then we thought that might not be a good idea for the Sniper because then everyone would see him.  It's a thought anyway.  I picked up and listened to  Selmasongs  today after it had collected dust over the last year.  What a musical spectacular.  Bjork is one talented imp.  I remember how happy I was the first time I listened to this album, and in my excitement, I called up HAL to share my good fortune.  She very unenthusiastically informed me that a 'certain coworker' of hers had the album too and played it all the damn time.  I guess she didn't like it as much as me and the 'certain coworker' did.  Hmmmm.  I'm going solo to my cousin's wedding this weekend.  My brother and dad already promised a dance with me.  Great, that's all I need to feel better - to dance with a couple of 6' 6' buffoons.  There better be an all-night open bar.  Or the DJ better play U2-all-night-long.    Things have been pretty slow around these parts.  I go to NYC again next week, so hopefully things will pick up by then.  Cheers!          "
"            Christina Aguilera is trampy.  I just saw this thing on MTV where she performed under the Brooklyn bridge and then was interviewed by Carson Daly.  I have also seen her 'Dirty' video (though I'm kinda surprised by everyone's outrage there - it's not like they've undercovered Snow White's secret porn flick).  So there's my judgement for today.         "
"            Burn Junkie   This morning I found myself thinking about the summer vacation I took with my family in August.  We were in the south, in a state where there are fire ants.  At midweek, the mid-point of our trip, a fire ant bit me on my right foot.  For the uninitiated, fire ant bites start with a pinch-like sting, then leave a burning sensation that spreads an inch in every direction from the bite epicenter.  About an hour after the bite, my foot was red in a circle (one inch in diameter) and graced by a mild itching sensation.  At that moment, I realized that I loved the entire thing: the bite, the sting, the burn and the itch.  On the last day of our vacation, I went back to the fire ant hill and stood there on my left foot until I was bitten again (less than ten seconds).  This morning, as the mercury strived for 30 fahrenheit and the wind pushed hard for the 20's, I understood that soon winter will come to the entire country and the fire ants that were so kind to me a couple of months ago will be gone.

"           I just have one question:  If you have a regular site and a sister site, is that incest?         "
"           Hiya Kids...  Nah, I didn't go into hiding, I just decided to shut ol' Soft Drink down for a multitude of reasons.  Below, here are a few:   1.  Now that I don't have as much to complain about, content has been kind of thin.  2.  It got to be more trouble than fun maintaining daily content.  3.  People (in my old circle of friends) have made my goings-on the topic of too many drunken conversations.  4.  A lot of clowns misunderstood or would read the wrong tone in some of my posts.  5.  I want to do something different with the Soft Drink moniker.  Something big, fresh, exciting...  I've gotten a ton of e-mails about the site shutting down already and I feel kind of bad about it.  No worries, though.  I plan to get back in the blogging mix again with a new and improved page of sorts.  When?  Don't know.  Until then, I've got Pandyland to frequent and I hope to get working on my 2nd book.  It's almost finished, so I'll probably post more on my sister site:  How I Got Published (or tried anyway)...          "
"           I think DJS had to go into hiding because of that whole fiasco with the Chipotle Mafia.         "
"           DJS, what happened to Soft Drink?           "
"           Im running into a little trouble here this morning. Im tired. And I keep zoning out. I keep catching myself staring off into space, and I dont even remotely look like I am working.  I have become a zombie.         "
"             Little Purple Pill/A Guy from Nebraska/I'm in love   I'm pretty sure I have acid reflux disease...it was only a matter of time.  Anyway, it was a good run for me, and now it is time for me to get right with God.  At DJS's on Saturday night some guy named Murray mixed up a concoction called a...well, I don't know what it was called.  Anyway, it was a shot of Jaegermeister submerged in half a glass of Red Bull.  It was surprisingly delicious.  It tasted like a sweet tart.  I have to give Milton props for a great drink.  I had one.  DJS had 2 (at least).  HAL had none.  But Marcus begged her every time he poured one.  Anyway, this guy Manny was from Nebraska.  Just throwing that out there.  In an unrelated news item, I'm in love with Bjork (add your own umlaut/diaresis).  She is a total artist, and she is well pierced.           "
"           Hey thanks!  I had a great time on Saturday, even if it was a bit low-key.  There were a couple of moments through the day where I stopped and looked at DJ LZ and was like: 'Holy shit.  I'm 30!'  But all in all, it wasn't so bad.  I guess when I hit 35 or 40, I'll just spend the day weeping or something.  Thanks for stopping by and for the book, HAL.  It's going into the rotation immediately and from a cursory flip-through, it should be right up my alley.  Thanks!!!         "
"           Happy (belated) birthday, DJ Shovelpants!         "
"           Was it something I said?         "
"           About Soft Drink...  I don't know that I'm gonna put a link on Pandyland to Soft Drink.  It'd be kind of weird, like bridging two different worlds together that really should be kept seperate.  Who knows, maybe if I lighten up a bit and not worry about it so much.  Of course, one of my big concerns is that I've got two different blogging 'handles' and it might be confusing to those who don't know who I am.  Does that make me a jerk?  Quite frankly, I'm amazed anyone even reads Soft Drink, so...  Since tomorrow is the big 3-0 for me, Duf, CK2 and I are going to see  The Ring  today on company time.  We're calling it 'Team Building.'  I call it getting the hell out of the office for a good 2 hours or so.  Best...birthday...ever.         "
"           Hey guys,  DJS - Nice work with the links and photo page!  Me likey.  Any chance we'll get a link to soft drink? ;)  Me also likey not working.  This morning mom and I went for facials, then to Cafe Latte for lunch.  While Cafe Latte is normally a great lunch spot it was more crowded then I'd ever seen it (due to MEA weekend??) and I felt rushed through the line by the pair behind us.  It used up all the relaxation I had banked up the hour before.  The crazy woman behind us kept telling her friend that she got her teeth 'from the bone bank - doesn't that sound weird?'.  For the record lady, yes it does.  She repeated it several times to her buddy, though I'm sure the she heard it each time, just like all the rest of us did.  Then she said 'some people died from knee parts that they got from the bone bank, I hope that doesn't happen to me!!'  Well, I disagree.  I hope she dies.  While in St. Paul I swung by the UST bookstore (long story).  It was really weird to be in such a familar place with not a single familar face  - except for a glimpse of Fr. Lavin shuffling through Murray-Herrick (speaking of people about to die...).  Anyway, not much has changed, though the Grill got all new chairs and tables and it looks pretty nice.  No update on 'Scooters', though.  Sorry, Panda.           "
"           Yeah...I'm a rotten Blogger.  I might be just pooped from all the revampin' I did on this-here site.  Nah...that's not it.  I think part of it is that I've been a writin' whore on Soft Drink, so I guess I gots to wait until I have some exclusive fun to drop on Pandyland.  Panda, if you find any cool jobs in your travels, let me know.  I'm fed up with this place.  Yeee...         "
"           Sorry Stoner.  I can't talk for the other Pandyland slobs, but I've been caught up in job-searching mania.    I think Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree is a perfect name...not only does it touch on a Milwaukee delicacy, it has the same PBJ initials.  Brilliant!  You should be in communications or something.         "

I might have to resort to finding a group of drunk girls who don't mind doing Jigs on street corners.  Oh wait...  My little brother doesn't know it yet, but we will be staying with him.  If asked, he will wear his Angry Scotsman wig and Kilt apron to join us on Water Street in style.  Stay tuned...         "

"            Props to Panda for the great pics!!  You'd think by this point in my life I'd know enough not to drink near flashbulbs, but alas, I am naive.    Speaking of Panda, last night she told me that she's busy planning the Milwaukee-flavored jamboree.  So don't expect too many post from her - you have no idea what it takes to organize a parade on short notice.  Or am I saying too much??  Stoner, no more wart-related posts, please.  In return, I'll publicly acknowledge the fact that you kicked my ass in 'Stratego' again last night.  THAT'S sharing.         "
"            At its height, the internet, like a vibrant democracy, provides a forum for the free exchange of ideas.  As a community, we can work toward consensus and truth by debating issues of the day and elevating responses that are sound logically, ideologically, philosophically.   Within the internet community, a blog, and in particular a group blog like this is a distillation of that forum.  Together, us members of Pandyland can develop synergy and a higher collective understanding.  We are all like mountain climbers progressing toward a summit and infinitely more likely to reach it because we are not working alone, but, rather, in concert with like minded people.  We are a team focused on a single goal.  In order for us to reach that goal, we need to feel that we can talk about things freely and openly.  So, when Panda shares her story of love on the rocks, we are, as a community, elevated.  When HAL told her story of back pain, we were enriched.  DJS's deep sharing about his love of the Band the Eels was awe-inspiring.    And in that spirit, I would like to thank Stoner for bringing us all closer together, for stimlulating a marketplace where ideas can be exchanged, and for bringing us all closer to higher truths by sharing her story about her struggles to overcome plantars warts.  Which everyone knows come from sinful living and not swimming pools.  Are you right with God, Stoner?  You must be because the smite was lifted!    But I digress from praising Stoner for helping us on our climb:  can you see the summit friends?   Also, DJS, I would like to suggest the band name:  This Treatment (with mad props to Stoner).          "
"           Okay, I'm only admitting this because they are gone now, but I used to have plantars warts all over the bottoms of my feet. I was a swimmer all through high school and college, and pool decks and locker room showers are hotbeds for wart 'seeds' as my mom called them.  Anyways, I just read about  urlLink  this treatment  and it made me cringe.  Still, it probably isn't worse than what I endured. I went to the doctor every other week for a few months, and she would cover each wart in a liquid that caused big, deep blisters. I'd have to poke them with a safety pin, and would limp around until they peeled and healed.   (Note to DJS -- I think 'Peeled and Healed' would be a good band name.)  Needless to say, these days I never EVER go near a locker room or pool deck without flip flops on.          "
"           I just got Pandas pics. Man, the PBJ was great. I miss it.   In other news, I tripped going up the stairs at work today, right in front of a guy I used to think was cute. For the record, I stopped thinking he was cute when I heard how many times hes dipped his nib in the office ink (as they say in  Bridget Joness Diary )  but that didnt make the wipeout any less embarrassing.         "
"           I'd like to have another Jamboree soon, as I don't remember much of the last one... *sigh*.  I'm pretty sure I had a nice time, though.  How did I get the 'Gino' tatoo??         "
"           She's gone for the day, so I'll sneak to her cube and eyeball the situation.  1. The drink is still in the glass. 2. It's still pink. (she thought we'd staged it and just used pink lemonade) 3. I could be wrong, but it looks like a little of it is missing.  She might've taken a sip of it by mistake here at work. 4. Believe it or not, she didn't throw it away.  It's still sitting out in plain view.  I'm going to go over and take a digital picture of it.         "
"           I thought knowing the fate of the drink would be enough  but it only triggered more questions:  1. Was the drink still actually in the glass?  2. How did it look by Monday morning?  3. Did she drink it?  4. If not, what did she do with it?          "
"           What a night.  Expertly captured by D to tha U to tha F.  Here's some of the things that stuck in my head:   1.  Come to think of it...I WON'T have a Heineken.  2.  Pick it up! Pick it up! pick it up!  3.  The men's bathroom.  Smelled like old vomit and heaven help the person who needs to go in there for an extended visit.  4.  That idiot dancing and grooving by the jukebox.  Went home alone.  5.  The look on Gino's face when HAL said we were having a Jig-Off.  6.  'God Made All Of This' MC's' tyrade about God.  Yeah, he's responsible for Gin N' Juice and all of the human filth and garbage in the Country Bar.  If he made all of that...he must've taken the day off.  7.  My repeated threats to wreck the place only fueled my Bon Jovi performance.  I had a damn good time...really!  A Milwaukee road trip really should happen.  Hit Water Street in high style, and bring a laptop so that we can blog in real-time.  How damn cool would that be???         "
"           Oh yes.  She appreciated it ten-fold.         "
"           I must know -- did the drink make it to CK 2's desk intact?         "
"           To quote DJS: Duf Fer's PBJ1 play-by-play is 'COMEDY PLATINUM.'  I couldn't have said it better.  Thanks to all who came out for our night of debauchery.  The film (evidence) has been turned in and photos will be distributed this week.  The rest of the weekend did not involve excessive amounts of alcohol, but it definitely involved excessive amounts of fun - the highlight being at the movie theater's photo sticker booth: Jillios, Stoner, HAL, and Panda have been forever emblazoned on a 'Girls Rule' sticker.  Sorry Stoner - to really be part of the club, you must buy a cell phone to stick it to.    See y'all at PBJ2 - maybe we should screw Milwaukee and head someplace warm - perhaps New Orleans?  We could invite Gino to judge Jig Off Part Deux - 'Who Can Show the Most Skin.'  On second thought, I don't want to be on the next 'Girls Gone Wild' video.  Milwaukee is a better idea.  Beer, cheese, & sausage...Delicious!            "
"            Pandyland Burrito Jamboree (PBJ1 - to those in the know):   Would You Rather  read a really long post about the PBJ1 or be forced to read bunghole for a week?  Where to begin...  The  Beatnik Chicken ? The  Flavor Twists ?  CK 2's Cocktail ?  No, I think we all know where we have to begin...the  Jig Off!   Like all official competitions that take place on Lyndale avenue after bar, our jig off need a judge and got one:   Jig Judge Gino .  HAL jigged. Panda jigged. C...e jigged.  Gino studied the jigs intensely (too intensely?) and picked HAL as the winner.  So, for those of you scoring at home, the winner of the First (annual? semi-annual?  monthly?)  Pandyland Burrito Jamboree Jig Off  was HAL (for the record, DJS and your humble narrator did not compete).  I think Gino kissed HAL, but I'm not sure.  Gino shared his  Flavor Twists  with all PBJ1 attendees who were daring enough to eat them.  Then, the ever cool (and primarily toothless) Gino declined our offer to go on and on until the break of dawn because, to quote  Jig Judge Gino  directly  'I'm fittin' to go home and smoke me some weed.'  Does he know that marijuana is contraband listed among the items prohibited by our state's controlled substances statute?  Who knew we were partying with a miscreant?  But wait it gets worse...  We take the party over to  Super Big Mike's Subs  or whatever the phuck it's called and it was too lame to tame so we go to Dulono's for some pie (except your ambitious author who had the grilled cheese), and our waiter memorized the orders for the entire table (including beverages, toppings, and everything).  We declare:   'he's a genius,'  and he replies  'no, I just smoke a lot of pot.'   Is it me, or is the entire nation on the wacky tobacky?  A  Beatnik Chicken  watched and  Simon and Garfunkel  provided (inaudible - no amped music after 12:00) background music to the meal.  But, before I poo poo the Stoner Nation, the criminal world, I must report that the Pandyland crew pulled a couple of  PBJ1 Capers :  Your earnest secretary stole  CK2's Cocktail  glass from the  Country Bar  and DJS (a patriot if ever there was one) stole his  American Flag Glass  from Dulono's.  He claims it was their fault for putting the flag on it.  Frankly, I agree.  But I haven't mentioned the  Country Bar  at all:  The Karaoke master was a limp dicked nobody.  We were surrounded by freaks.  One guy came up to the table and asked DJS  'Do you have any reps at this table?'   We still don't know what the phuck that means.  DJS said 'no.'  Another guy, after singing Snoop Dogg covers thirteen or fourteen times, challenged DJS's assertion that there was no God (because what God would deny us the mic when others had it all night long?) by saying  'look around you - God created this.'   Then, as proof that God  is  real, and really does create stuff,  DJS Got the Mic , and I assure you God was in him while he brought the hizzy dizzy with his holy spirit filled rendition of Bon Jovi's  You Give Love a Bad Name .  He really brought the house down (all the way down).  Now, to end with the quotes of the night (in no particular order.  I asked Gino to judge, them and he said 'man, cough...cough...cough...they are all...like...beautiful man.  It would be like...cough...wrong to judge man.').  So here they are:  'Come to Milwaukee!'  Hmmm...PBJ 2? 'Are we going to Gino's or what?' 'I want the dick.' 'Gonorrhea all the way.' 'Would you rather...?' 'I can't run, I have a cocktail in my pants.' 'Would you pass me a niz-ap-kin?'  All in all, PBJ1 was a HUGE success.           "
"           Warning! There are jokes on specially marked Diet Coke bottles. To get the punchline, you have to go to their web site. DO NOT GO TO THEIR SITE. The jokes suck. They arent funny at all. Okay  one was semi-funny, but not funny enough to justify wasting valuable web-surfing time.   Im so disappointed. I expected more from the worlds largest soda manufacturer.

"            News Flash:   Duf Fer and I just got back from a quick jaunt to Rainbow Foods where I was asked to pick up some treats for a training session.  Wait...you mean I can get out of the office for an additional half hour?  Sold, baby.  So we're listening to the Rolling Stones 2 Disc set we each purchased within the last few days.  At the food depot, we snatch some cupcakes and a nice box of cookies and we're good to go.  On the way out, I head down the pasta aisle.  Why?  Don't know.  I just did...but now, I wonder if it's fate.  On the lower shelf where no one can really see them is the most beautiful value pack this Blogger has ever laid eyes on.  5 boxes of delicious original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese packaged together with a bonus.  What bonus, you ask?  Why...a free E.T. bendable figurine, staring back at us from the cellophane box he's held hostage in.  ' Gimme ,' I said and scooped it up.  At a price of $3.99 I was more than sold.  At the counter, the lady asked if I had an Easy Save card.  Does the Pope shit in the woods?  Of course I do.  She swiped it and it was as thought the band started playing the parade song early.  Her eyes widened as she told me about the savings I was about to reap.  ' This is a good deal ,' Linda the Rainbow lady quiped.  ' You saved half. '  $2.00???  Yes friends.  Five boxes of deliciousness and a little brown friend to keep you company.  Life is good.  So good in fact that Duf ran back down the aisle and fetched a Blue Box Value Pack for himself.  As he was checking out, I spied the offer on the back of the boxes.  For a mere $14.99, you can have you child's picture put onto a box of macaroni & cheese, right below the banner that says 'The Cheesiest.'  Now, I don't have any kids, but...well, let's say I've spent my money in worse ways.  Sold!  P.S. I'm anxious as all get out for the Pandyland Jamboree tonight.  Gonna rock this town...  (I'm so excited, I'm posting this on Soft Drink, too.)         "
"           I don't like cats either.  In fact, I despise them and the people who own them, especially because I'm allergic.  I'm a dog lover.  And remember: God spelled backwards does not spell cat.           "
"           UmmmP. Diddy? Busta? I dont know who sings that. Give me more lines.   I just interviewed the biggest character at my company. He absolutely, positively, completely and totally loves direct mail with all of his heart. And if you ask him how he is, hell say something along the lines of I am so incredibly wonderful right now, its almost impossible to be any better.   When I first interviewed him last year, he tried to get me to change my auto insurance. Today he filled me in on the entire history of sales, marketing, and direct mail. (It was actually quite interesting.) He is definitely the king of leave silence and someone will fill it which left me cracking some pretty confused one-liners in hopes of getting the subject back on track.   I knew I was in for it when I walked into his office and sat down  the first words out of his mouth were so when are you getting married? to which I replied umsomeday? I hope? I am currently un-engaged, with no plans to get engaged in the near future He just looked at me with a straight face. I couldnt figure out if he was going to set me up with a grandson or something. (Hes old enough to be retired, but loves direct mail too much to quit.)   I think he tries to shake things up at the start of every conversation, and thats why he has so much fun. Either that or hes crazylike a fox.   Finally, Panda I hope that meow was coming from you and not from me (Coco) because I dont like cats.         "
"           DJS, I read your recent posting on Soft Drink - I  knew  you would like  urlLink  The Best Page in the Universe .  When I read it, half the stuff sounded like your own posts.  Comedic insults galore!  I especially like the article 'People who like David Lynch movies are idiots.'    NYC really smells.  That's something I will never miss about this city.  When you're walking down the street you get whiffs of sewage, hot dog water, and then patchouli.  Yes, patchouli.  There are these guys that sell this nasty incense stuff on the street.  Who the hell ever thought that patchouli was a nice scent?  I'd rather bathe in hot dog water any day.  All you hippies stink.  I'm serious.    On a more cheerful note - I can't wait for tonight.  What could be better than drinking cheap beer and listening to the melodious sound of Duf's voice?  Coco's comin' out too - I can feel it!  Meow!         "
"            I'm thinking Lynard Skynard (in honor of America's Sweetheart, Reese):  In Birmingham they love the guv-nah (ew, ew, ew), And we all did what we could do Not watergate it does not botha me, Does your conscience botha you? now tell me true.  [cue guitars] Sweet Home Alabama [guitar interlude] Where the skys are blue [more guitar here] Sweet Home Alabama [yep, guitar] I'll be comin' home to you.  Panda, make sure to show some love for DJS and Duf when out shopping!  'Tonight's the night we make history!'  Stoner, who sings that?           "
"           Money?  I'll sing for money.   $50 minimum, but I'll do it.         "
"           Roy? Sounds like a Grade A suckerhead.  Eff him.  I'm getting a little antsy in anticipation for the hoe-down tomorrow night.  Is that crazy?  I don't know if it's because I haven't been out and about for quite some time, but I'm looking to get a little surly (not really) and pick a fight with a bearded biker (no, I won't) and end up picking up my teeth off of the sidewalk (never happen).  I know my boss CK 2 is looking forward to seeing me rock the mic...and I'll be soooo disappointed if Duf doesn't throw something down vocally.  I think the boy has got real singing chops.  I'm pretty sure he can sing the pantalones vaqueros off of anyone in the joint.  And yes...he's going to win all the money.  All the money.         "
"           Speaking of Roy, I sent that guy an invite and he never posted a damn thing here.  What's up with that?         "
"           Please tell me you were able to fit Ben into your luggage. Or even Javier -- he'd at least be entertaining, and we could set him up with Roy.         "
"           I just looked at the weather and it's supposed to be 30 frickin degrees in Minneapolis this weekend.  I may have to reconsider my visit.  It's 60 in NY right now.  How does one pack for such extremes??  I took a walk last night after work.  When I'm here in NY by myself, I don't have many options for things to do: I either go back to my hotel room and watch way too much TV and eat a bag of Pirate's Booty (my favorite), or I go wander around until the stores close and spend money.  I opted for the latter.  I walked aimlessly south.  I found myself in the middle of NYU's campus and thought about Ben, Felicity, Noel...and then remembered that they aren't real people...and that the show isn't even on anymore.  *tear*  Then I went through my favorite part of town: on Broadway through Chelsea, then south of Houston (hence 'SoHo'), and through the Village.  I went to my favorite market in SoHo, to the cheesy junk stores in Chinatown, and then to Dean & Deluca.    I may have a nice surprise for HAL and Stoner because of my aimlessness.  And the fact that I like to buy stuff for people when I'm bored.         "
"           I want to clear up a misconception.   The correct pronunciation of my name is not 'Duff Furr' as many people seem to think.  It is:  'Do Fair.'  It's French.    Thanks,  Duf Fer  P.S.  Panda, I saw the Portland pics.  I got all blurry just looking at some of them.  Anyhoo, I think we will out do the donut extravaganza no problem.  Both Stoner and HAL represent (as in 'rep-RAH-zaint').         "
"           Stoner, I agree.  We just had a belated birthday celebration for 2 people on my team.  Someone brought Dunkin Donuts and we sat around and talked about stupid TV shows like the Bachelor and the Real World ('those girls are SLUTS!') and then we went back to our desks.  What a waste of time.  And no one even sang the birthday song.  So  urlLink here's something  that made me laugh out loud this morning.  'Good job Kelly, now pack up your shit and find a foster home.'   I needed that after the weak Donut Extravaganza.  Let's hope our Burrito Jamboree is more festive.            "
"           Why is it that when we write something cheesy in a greeting card, we sometimes feel compelled to add the words just kidding?   I just did that  as if my coworker would think I was serious when I wrote birthdays are so great, you should have them more often! For one thing, isnt even possible. Still, I felt I needed to add that just in case she didnt get my sense of humor.   Workplace celebrations are awkward.         "
"           Stoner, to satisfy your love of rap and my love of duets, we should sing a little diddy that combines both.  I betcha 'Walk This Way' by Aerosmith/Run DMC would work.  We could each trade off the mic during the chorus.    I just want to hear you scream 'WALK THIS WAY!' as I respond with a more subdued 'Talk this way.'  Hey, I deserve it.  After that I have a wedding ring we can pawn off for more beer money.          "
"           Two 'rritos (I thought they needed a nickname) and Lil' Sickie WILL be there, I assure you. Coco will have no trouble with the four drinks though, after her training camp last weekend. And the Reaper's Assistant wants to borrow your cell phone.   I know my demands don't carry much weight since I do not intend to sing (my only karaoke experience thus far has been in the rap genre), but I swear heads will roll if I don't hear someone do a duet with Panda. I mean it.         "
"           I'm thinking two burrito and four drink minimum on friday.  No exceptions.  I hope Lil Sickie comes out, she parties like a rock star.  I'm prepared to announce that Coldplay's  A Rush of Blood to the Head  is the album of the year.  Everyone has to listen to it during the Jamboree.  No exceptions.  HAL, let me know if you need five faces.  Now all we need is a reason for Panda and HAL to get 'they drank' ( all the way ) iz-on...k...give me a moment...  DJS I'm thinking  Sweet Child O' Mine .  No exceptions.           "
"           Wow...my reputation as a crank caller is spreading.  Crazy.  Of course, I'd be happy to lend my services.  I've even got equipment to record the calls so we can enjoy it at another time.  Options, baby.  We're talking options...  But yes...the Burrito Karaoke Marathon is going to be the bizz-omb.  It's been a while since I've done that.  Uh...sing in public that is.  The burrito consumption remains on the strong tip.  I really hope HAL pulls through and finds a good place to rock the mic, though.  Elsie's isn't really condusive for the kind of entertainment that we're prepared to provide.  It's busy and the fat lady that runs it wants me dead, I'm pretty sure.         "
"           Now that the P-town excitement has died down, I can focus my energy on gearing up for the Pandyland Burrito/Karaoke Jamboree!  In other news, our crazy neighbors still have anti-window-washer paraphernalia on their door. I wonder how long it will last. If y'all wanted, we could knock on their door and confront them as part of the Jamboree. Or, I've heard DJS is a master crank-caller -- maybe we should try to get their phone number...it's probably listed on one of their faxes or memos to our apartment management company...         "
"           I spent last weekend in Portland with Stoner and Mrs. Headrick.  It was a fabulous time, but I just realized that every time I leave the state with Stoner, a new alter-ego pops up, a la Sybil.  'The Reaper's Assistant' now joins 'Lil Sickie' and 'Coco'.  Panda, hold on to the invites.  They will be soon be valuable collectors items.  Sell 'em on Ebay!!!         "
"           Pandyland turned Haiku Town...   TGIF  Thank God it's Friday A burrito would be nice Stiff drink sounds better   Cancelled Wedding  Picked up the invites Can't reuse those things - dammit. Cash down the shitter           "
"           Five Things by Fer, Duf:  1.  In the words of Elton John 'I'm still standing.' 2.  DJS, those in the know call is CYE. 3.  Must get HBO to keep up with Sopranospeak. 4.  Too pumped about Pandyland Burrit....er...Karoake Jamboree! 5.  What is ass-play?  I guess I had to see it to understand...         "
"            Panda B:  Yeah, I'm guessing your talking about the ass-play scene with Ralphie and Janice.  Uh...not sure where that came from.  They're doing everything in their power to make that character even more repulsive than he was in the previous episode.  Mission accomplished.  Admittedly, though...I tend to like the REALLY bad guy (Ralphie) and the REALLY nice guy in the show (Bobby).  Ironically, they're both going to get mixed up with each other because of that pig Janice.  Joey Fat-one?  My girlfriend would be thrilled.  She's all about the N'Stink.  Oh...I can't wait to see what next week holds.  If you haven't watched the show, pick up an episode or two at the video store.  Be like us!  Best show EVER.   Duf:  Watched most of Curb Your Enthusiasm last night.  It's actually pretty damn funny.         "
"           I forgot to tell y'all about seeing Joey Fatone from N'Sync on Monday.  Billygoat and I decided to press our luck and try to get rush tickets to Rent.  BG was a lucky man and his name got called - we got front row seats to Rent for $20 a piece.    And Joey Fatone was the star.  During their standing ovation we were seriously 1 foot from him.  I told BG he should touch his shoe, just to say he touched one of the members of N'Sync.    He said that wouldn't be something to brag about.  So what was with that one scene in the Sopranos this week?  If you saw it, you  know  what I'm talking about.  Ewwwww.          "
"           Some of my personal drama has died down a bit since last Friday, so I thought I'd come here to Pandyland for a little respite.  Only to find... everyone fighting!  Why can't we all just get along?  When I come to Mpls next weekend I demand a group hug from all of you....And to see DJS and Duf sing 'Endless Love' for our Pandyland karoke night.         "
"           You know, Stoner might be onto something.  One of the reasons we're all here in the first place was because Stoner was so close to getting 'booted' from that crappy little site from before.  Uh...Butthole.com or something...I don't know, but I'm sure it was anus-related.  With our 'the-truth-hurts' brand of comments we left on that aforementioned site, we started a revolution...and a rivalry.  People were actually interested in Crapbox.com for a day or two.  Kind of funny that Panda got the El Boot (Spanish for 'The Boot') and thus Pandyland was born.  Anyway, glad to be back in the hizzy.         "

"           Unfortunately, DJS, I think  we're  our only fans.  :(  So I'm off to London/Brussels tomorrow evening and  can't wait .  I can't wait to eat  real  fish and chips, watch the Big Breakfast, go to some good Indian Restaurants, attend an evensong at Westminster Abbey, eat Belgian chocolate, and talk to many British men.  What I will not do: buy Belgian lace.  For some screwed  up reason my mom is sad that I'm not more into the lace-thing.  It's not like I plan on ever decorating with doilies, so I don't know what the problem is.  I met a friend for drinks a couple days ago when I was in NY.  We had traveled through Thailand together (not really by choice, he happened to be in my MBA class) and so I think hes under the impression that we have this eternal bond.  Since Im usually bored out of my mind when Im in NYC for business, I hastily accepted his invitation.  Not much has changed with him since I last saw him a year ago  hes still a chachi frat boy who cant let go of the frat boy days when beer bongs were cool.  So the intellectual stimulation was minimal, but the scotch consumption was definitely to the maximum (which I bought on DDS tab, by the way).  Me?  I just had a glass of free champagne that came with my room.  So after getting the $70 bar tab and walking out of the place, he actually said to meYou know, if I didnt have a girlfriend right now, we could get it  on .  My reaction: You gotta be kidding me.  Guys are complete morons.  Sometimes it sucks to be single again.          "

Please don't give me a hard time about it.  I am intolerant of intolerance of lactose intolerance.  Like DJS, I am caffeine free, baby!  I did not see one second of The Bachelor.  I can say this though.  He is from Missouri; at some point he's become a wife-beater.           "
"           Helene it was! I knew it from the first episode I ever watched -- I wasn't even swayed by Gwen.  In regards to the other items that have been up for discussion lately:  1. I prefer skim milk. My problem is that I only have one glass out of the carton, and before I know it, it's expired. Then I am too scared to remove it from the refrigerator. So I ignore it until Hal yells at me.  2. Caffeine....mmmmmm....bzzzzzzzzz....what was I talking about?  3. Childhood vs. adulthood. I still watch the Muppet movies. That's all that matters, really.   4. My own discussion item - my 'social life' as my dad would call it. It's great to be dating someone who is really nice and funny and cute and that I enjoy being around. But in a way it sucks too - because I get all excited to see him, and that means I have to sit in my chair for EIGHT HOURS of torture, wishing the end of the day was here already. It's definitely going to be a long day...expect lots of posts from me...         "
"           Alright, tonight it's going to be Helene all the way.  And my bet is that Aaron pops the question.  This AM my favorite morning DJ, 'Scrappy', made some good points.  He said that if he's The Bachelor, he's 'not feeling' either of the girls.  He said that Helene is 'a cold B' and Brooke is 'too clingy'.  In his view, 'men don't like static cling, especially the female variety'.  Scrappy is the new Dr. Phil.         "
"           Wow.  I don't log in for an afternoon and I miss all the good shiz-nit.  Let me tackle the important issues in brief.   1% Milk  - I'm with HAL all the way on this.  I refuse to drink that transparent skim milk sludge.  It's watery, gross and you don't get the good spits from drinking a pint of skim.  Ick...just think of it...  'No...we don't want real milk...let's just SKIM some off the top.'   Caffeine  - Tomorrow will mark my one month anniversary of being caffeine free.  Crazy...but that's how it goes.  I'm really beginning to think that caffeine really didn't have that much sway over me.  I'm still able to stay up as late as I need to (1:30am last night) and now I don't get the jitters around 11:30am or so if I don't have a delicious Diet Coke.  Does I miss it?  Yes...but I've got a hard time accepting that something like a frigging Soft Drink had that much of a hold on me.   Kids Stuff  - As you may all be aware, I'm pretty much immune to the 'growing up' requirements.  This is the stuff I STILL do:   1.  Play Vids (or Video Games to the lamen)  2.  Get Happy Meals at McD's  3.  Read comic books  4.  Buy an occasional action figure  5.  Read children's books.  I highly recommend the Series of Unfortunate Events series  6.  Eat Orange Tic Tacs like candy, instead of using them as breath mints  7.  Fart on the phone when I'm talking to my brother  8.  Buy dumb things out of coin machines: super balls, stickers, crappy rings  9.  Think Star Wars is the best movie...ever.          "
"           Gee, Duf. I dunno. Maybe DIET COKE?!?!?!?!?!         "
"           What's better than sparkling water?         "
"           Duf, 'Skorts' should definitely NOT have an asterisk next to them.  They should be outlawed along with 'Sweatshirts' considering those two items could make a deadly fashion combination.  Oy!  As Hal can attest to, there is a woman in Minneapolis who wears skorts all the damn time - even in winter.  She is mean...and looks like a clown. 'Skorts' must be on the 'Appropriate Business Casual Attire' list where she works.             "
"           Whatever, Duf.  I just had a cup o' the full-fat milk, and you are currently visiting Best Buy during your designated working hours, which is basically a self-appointed recess.  Adulthood can be avoided.  DJS, how is the caffeine-avoidance program going?            "
"           That's a funny question, because off-hand I can think of a ton of things you are  supposed  to give up, but never do. For me, that is: 1. Sugar cereal for dinner. 2. Saved By the Bell 3. Macoroni & Cheese and hot dogs 4. Taking 'gas money' from your parents. 5. Watching Disney movies (ie 'Tuck Everlasting') and thoroughly enjoying them. 6. Telling on your brother when he squeezes your hand really, really hard during the 'Our Father' at church.  To add to Hal and Duf's list: 4. Riding in a Radio Flyer wagon. 5. Wearing a lot of hot pink (unless you're from New Jersey). 6. Zip shoes (but then again, I see old people take this up again when they're about 80.) 7. Your dad drawing funny cartoon pictures of guys smoking cigarettes on your brown bag lunch. 8. Sofa forts          "

Literally, I was sitting at my desk and felt like I was stoned (not that I have any idea what that's like) with my mouth hanging open and staring at the computer like I was some kind of a-hole.  It got so bad, that I told CK2 that I needed to go off and up out of the place and kill time until DJ LZ (my girlfriend) was ready to head back to the burbs.  So...what'd I do?  'There's a place for fun in your life...'  Mall of America, yo.  I went in, walking like a zombie and purchased a doughnut ala Krispy Kriz-eme and enjoyed a mouth-watering bottle of milk.  From there, I promptly headed to the video game store and played a demo version of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Gamecube.  I got to fly a ship and kick some ass, but when my guy popped out of the ship and flipped on his lightsaber, the game took a turn for the worst.  It was some bad actor trying to do Mace Windu (Sam Jackson's character) and it stunk.  That, and a bunch of guys hit me with the killing.  Good time-waster, shitty game.  So, in a nutshell, I was too sick later that night for karaoke and such.  But I'm there next time.  P.S. Don't believe the Cocks.  8 Mile was a good flick.         "

I've been forced to listen to choice cuts off of his latest album 'Justified' and they all center around how people only like him because he's got money, how Britney Spears broke his heart, and girls.  That's it.  So, I'm pleased to announce that, along with my first song I've written 'Delicious Chips', I'm planning on penning a song that takes a shot at all the N'Sync's, Justins, and Backstreet Boys of the nation.

Gone on a job interview, which gives me hope that I will not be doing what I am doing now forever. 3. Gone on two dates with a very nice young man, and discovered that Figlio and Subway are equally romantic. 4.

"           I went to Milwaukee at the last minute on Saturday.  Saturday morning I looked on Ticketmaster.com and 2 more tickets had opened up for the sold-out opera 'Carmen', put on by the Florentine Opera Company at the Milwaukee Performing Arts Center (not to be confused with Art's Performing Center, a Milwaukee strip club...Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree starting point perhaps?...).  So I met my mom in the Beer Capital of the World for a cultural experience.  To make a long story short: my little brother played a  matador  in Carmen.  Somehow, my twerpy bro knows people in high places and got cast in this professional opera.  Can you imagine our fits of laughter when he appeared on stage with a matador's cape, black wig with a pony tail in the back, matador's hat, full make-up, and  pink  tights?  I thought I was going to lose it.  The people around us did not find it nearly as funny as we did.  Seeing him up there, trying to act serious, surrounded by world renowned opera singers was pure, unadulterated, comedy.  So that was definitely the high point of my weekend.          "

"           Speaking of freakish neighbors...I have a few of my own.  In the last 6 months, my apartment management company opened up our building to dog-owners.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm completely pro dog.  But when you put a massive dog like a rottweiler in a studio apartment, terrible things are bound to happen...things that make me want to strangle the mutts.  Take for instance the Spanish-speaking woman (I will call her Lola)  two  doors down from me.  I no longer need an alarm clock.  Lola leaves at 7:30 sharp every morning.  That happens to be the time I get up for work.  That also happens to be the time the dog becomes possessed by the devil.  I have no desire to find out if its bark is worse than its bite.  I'm convinced the dog has been trained to kill...he  screams  when Lola leaves.  I've already left one complaint to our management company and my neighbor right next to me (let's call her Bonnie) has left 4 complaints.  Last night Bonnie knocked on my door.  She said Lola has now complained about HER to our landlord...Lola's mad because she said Bonnie has been knocking on her door and harassing her (Of course Bonnie had just wanted to tell Lola to shut up her dog, and Lola never even answered the door.)  I told Bonnie I would be happy to vouch for her that Lola's dog is a complete menace.  Bonnie then informed me she's in law school and '[Lola] has made the wrong person mad.'  Whatever.  Then there are these 2 dudes (I call them dudes because to call them 'men' would be laughable) across the hall from me.  They both look like Jay of Silent Bob & Jay fame and they listen to old Pearl Jam albums all day long.  (How do these people afford rent?)  Seems rather appropriate since they are living in the apartment that Bill, the former resident and local drug dealer, lived.  (Refer to Pandyland archives.)  They have a huge dog as well - I'd call it a mix between a boxer and a rottweiler.  Mean, mean, mean.  He sniffed my butt the other day.  Now I'm getting sexually harassed by a dog.  Great.  Just another reason I can't wait to find a job and get the heck out of Chi-town.  Maybe I could do what this one guy on Michigan Ave was doing the other day.  He was all dressed up in a snow suit, and looked relatively normal.  Except for the fact he was carrying skis, wearing ski boots, and holding a 'Keystone, Colorado or BUST!' sign and a bucket to gather donations.  Wow, he must  really  like to ski.          "

"           So far, today has been well-spent.    I played a U2 lyrics trivia game.  It was kinda lame (only 5 multiple-choice questions), but I liked my score  5 out of 5 correct.  Your U2 trivia ranking is:  You sure your name isnt Bono?  That made me smile.  Today I remembered the new word I learned for cool.  My brother (younger, natch) refers to things as sick.  At first I thought he was saying slick, as in thats SLICK!, but then I realized he was saying thats SICK.  So then I thought that he was saying it wasnt good.  But then I found out that he was saying it is good.  So sick = cool.  I guess.  He said he got it from a friend he met in Italy who was from Long Island.  So I thought it was an isolated thing.  But then I heard someone (unrelated) to my brother refer to something they thought was good as sick.  I think it was on TV, or something.  So that means its probably not an isolated thing.

Back to getting things straight-  Here's my update (boring in comparison):  I survived hurricane Lequetta (Mother of Duffer) being in town (but just barely, friends, just barely).

I will share my two favorite sentences from holiday letters received Chez Duffer.  It's priceless - let's just say my old high school debate partner was cuckholded (can women be cuckholded, or is they just cheated on?), and I think two friends (married) got it  all the way on  while turkey hunting.

"           Uh, no.  Mr. Shovelpants shouldn't get that guide.  You can't have something like that falling into the wrong hands.  Since we're talking movies, I'll DISH on a couple I've seen recently:   Catch Me if You Can  - Entertaining.  This will probably turn out like all Hanks movies (yeah, I know, it's really Leo's show) for me - I see it in the theater, enjoy it, and then never see or really think of it again.  It was the same for me and 'Road to Peredition', 'Cast Away', 'The Green Mile', 'Saving Private Ryan'... you get the idea.  Though I should say that out of that list, 'Road to Peredition' was the best.   Adaptation  - Entertaining.  Weird.  In case you're unaware, it's buy the same writer and same director as 'Being John Malkovich', so it's not 'Maid in Manhattan' (though wouldn't it be great if those two did the remake?).  There are a few things to discuss, but since I don't think any of the rest of you have seen it, I'll wait.  This I can say - there are moments in that movie that are so quitely hilarious that I just think, 'wow'.  They don't hammer the point home, which is so rare and so great to see.         "

"           Panda, I'm in total compliance with you on both counts.  I thought  Jackass: The Movie  was sheer genius.  I don't remember laughing so hard in my life...well, in the last couple of years anyway.  I personally thought the end thing (after the credits) with them as old men was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of exessiveness.  Anyway.  As for Kevin Smith latest foray: I haven't seen it and I highly doubt I ever will.  I struggled through  Dogma  which was such an over-rated piece of crap, I kind of felt cheated.  Was I offended by it because I'm religious?  No, and for the record, I'm about as agnostic as they get.  I just thought the performances were awful (Linda Fiorentino was horrible) and that snootchie-bootchie shit is for the birds.  After seeing 'Shitma' in the theatres, I swore off seeing any more Jay & Silent Bob movies.  They pantsed me on Mallrats and I felt taken again with Dogma.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. The funniest thing is, ol' Kevie Smith peaked at Clerks and that was the flick he did with the smallest budget.  Oh...if anyone is wondering how  Gangs Of New York  is, I can sum it up in a couple of words: Waste Of Time.  Easily one of the worst (and most boring) movies I've seen in a long time.   Catch Me If You Can  was pretty good, though.         "
"            Funny movie, disappointing movie   Have any of you seen Jackass: the Movie?  It was really funny.  I kind of shocked myself how much I laughed.  Although it made me feel physically ill during some parts (Yellow Snow Cone anyone?), it was well worth it.  Check it out.  Silent Bob & Jay Strike Back...this one was a huge disappointment to me.  Other than the cameos being pretty amusing, it was a  little  too over-the-top.  But how could you ever repeat the genius of Clerks?             "
"           HAL, you ignorant slut!  Somehow you captured the NY Jewess accent perfectly!  Boy, was I snowed.  I think I'm regressing, because it seems to me I did just have puke in my hair recently.  Bizarro world strikes again.  I'm going to Second City tonight and I can't wait to laugh my ass off...plus, tomorrow is the Brew and View's best line-up to date: cheap pitchers of Miller Light will be enjoyed while watching Jackass: The Movie, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, AND Office Space on the big screen.  Tremendous picks!  To any of you who have not enjoyed the simple pleasure of B&V at the Vic, next time you're in town I will personally take you.  It's that fun!             "
"           Panda, time for me to fess up.  It was me impersonating your manager.  Well, I thought it was funny...  I'm getting my hair painted blonde-er this evening after work.  I'm looking forward to this.  Wow.  Friday evenings used to be for getting puke in my hair.  Times have changed.         "
"            What kind of bizarro world do I live in?   I just got called by one of my managers in NY.  She just scolded me.  No lie, an outright, crack-the-whip, SCOLD.  It reminds me of the time I was in Catholic grade school, was yelled at by the nuns because I had my shirt untucked, and then had to tuck it in in front of the whole class.  Except this time, I didn't almost pee my pants.  But I cried about as much...  I hate it here.          "
"           Yeah...Coldplay in Phoenix???  It sounds more like Hotplay.  Ah ha ha...er...  Is this thing on?         "
"           Wow, news travels fast 'round Pandyland.  Stoner is warm on #3, so she earns a 'good guess' award.  Coldplay is playing Phoenix in early February, and I like any excuse to leave Minnesota in January or February.  Heck, if Rick Astley was playing Nashville at the right time I'd probably go.  That's a  *probably* , Panda.  For you envious Coldplay fans, they are also coming to the Target Center in March.  So Coldplay is offering something for everyone.  They're great.          "
"            Three Guesses   Why are Panda and Hal going to Phoenix?  1. So Hal can brush up on her golf game wayyy before anyone else, and kick some serious boo-tay in summer. 2.

"           Yeah, I was pretty anti-Woodbury (or any suburb for that matter) myself before I moved there.  Now...I'm not sure I'd want to live anywhere else.  It's quiet out there.  You can see stars in the sky at night.  Everything is close by and I don't mind the people as much as I thought I would.  Plus...there's a Borders REALLY close by.  How kick-ass is that?  Traffic aside, it's not a bad place to live.  Much cheaper than those dumpy apartments I used to inhabit.         "

"           I would also like to say congrats DJS!  Although I don't know how I feel about you supporting Woodbury's economy in such a large way. I want it to shrivel up out there, so there's not so much traffic when I visit my mom & dad. Back when I was a kid, why, it was all open fields! But I suppose you live there now, so I should just shut my yapper and let you spend your money wherever you want...   For the record, to anyone who may have read Hal's post - I do not regift. I witnessed someone regifting (although, according to this un-named individual, it was something she liked so much she ran around town looking for the same thing this year to give to someone else - a likely story) an item they got from Hal. Of course, I couldn't keep it a secret. I had to tell her. Don't regift around me - I'll bust you.          "
"           Congrats, DJS!!  Thanks for spilling the story, too... I know it's hard for you share the mushy stuff.  We appreciate the effort.  :)  I'll bet it was a pretty good Christmas for Laura, too!  I had a very nice holiday, even if it was sans any red boxes.  I got some good gear and I think people liked the stuff I got them, so there should be few returns.  Though, as Stoner knows, sometimes people sometimes re-gift.  :)  I was able to spend a lot of time with my family over the two days of Christmas, and it was a good time.  My fam is deeply eccentric, and it's nice to know where I get it from...          "
"            Marry Chirstmas   Yep, yep...'tis true.  I'm gonna get myself married within the next year or so, hopefully.  Here's how it went down:  A couple o' weeks ago, Laura had a dream that she didn't want to tell me about.  Of course, I bullied her into telling me anyway, figuring it was going to involve Justin Timberlake in some way, shape or form.  It didn't.  Instead, she said that she dreamt that she got a little red box for Christmas.  Since we decided that we were going to get each other anything (since we just bought our townhouse and such together) I broke the news to her that a little red box wasn't really in the cards.  She knew that and explained that was why she felt dumb bringing it up.  Meanwhile, the tiny wheels in my head spun.  On Monday, she wasn't feeling well, but being the work-a-holic that she is, decided to go into work anyway.  We drove together and since it was slow and she didn't have much to do and felt considerably worse, we went home.  Both of us.  I dropped her off so she could fire herself right into bed and I decided to go out and do a bit o' Christmas shopping.  I went to the Maplewood Mall and spent a gift certificate CK2 had gotten for me only hours earlier (for those at home keeping score, I bought the Back to the Future Trilogy on DVD) and on my way home an idea hit me.  I needed to get Laura a card for X-mas.  What was near the Hallmark in Woodbury?  Yes, friends.  The Shane Co.  I went in, saw THE ONE RING, called it 'my precious' and I was on my merry, or marry way.  I planned to give it to her in Mankato at a big family function, so I needed to carry it with me, so's I could spring it on her.  In case you were wondering, yes...it was wrapped in red.  At my parents house, my brother bought his girlfriend some earrings wrapped in an IDENTICAL box.  For a second, I thought someone had found my package and set it on the counter.  I almost shit eggrolls.  Anyway, long story short, I decided to wait until we got home to propose.  I put the ring in an antique box next to the fireplace and hinted that Santa Claus might've come whilst we were in Mankato.  She thought I was a dork and went upstairs.  After much hinting and urging, I finally got her to go downstairs and look in her shittin' stocking.  I got her some dumb stuff like an N'Sync import album, Pretty In Pink on DVD, some of those Harry Potter jellybeans, etc.  She scolded me for getting her gifts when we decided not to.  As she went to hang her stocking back up, I got on my knee near my antique box and I said, 'Oh...I think there's one more.'  She said, 'What're you doing?'   I handed her the red lil' package and she opened the sucker up.  I was kind of nervous, but I managed a 'Do you think you'd want to marry me?'  She said yes.  Best...Christmas...EVER.         "

"           I may have mentioned that I wrote a song called  'Delicious Chips'  for my friend in Florida to do what he'd like with it.  Well...after a couple o' months waiting, it's finally done.  That's right: the song's done!!!  I'm an official songwriter now and I've got the CD with my songwriting opus on it.  There's also some of Big J's other songs on his album titled Snacktastic on there, including:  - Scurrvy Song Part 1 & 2 - I Like To Party - My Name Is Jared - Chrissypoo - Nothing's Going To Break My Stride (Cover)  I might be a little biased, but I think 'Delicious Chips' is the best song on the album.  The guy singing sounds like a poor-man's Sammy Hagar with a dash of Meatloaf thrown in.  If you have the means of stopping by sometime, I recommend it.  Good times.  Oh...lookit the time.  I'm Audi 5000 in just under 5 minutes.  Happy Holidays clowns.  If you're REALLY bored, why not submit a Holiday Haiku to Discount Haiku???         "

"           Everything old is new again...  Having attended pre-school through college in this town, youd think I run into people I know all the time.  In some ways this is true, but not nearly as much as youd expect.  The exception being that in the last two weeks I feel like I have run into everyone Ive ever known ever.  I ran into the previously mentioned Nick (lets all be thankful Im not using Pandas nickname for him) at Blockbuster a few weeks ago.  Of course, I heard him before I saw him.  Thankfully, I was able to duck out without him noticing me.  Now, before you judge me, I challenge any of you to engage with Nick by choice.  There.  So, a day or two after that near-miss I ran into a friends ex-bf at a bar.  What followed was a surprisingly uncomfortable conversation (who knew there were lingering feelings between him and myself?).  But I recovered.  Then on Saturday I got a call on my cell phone from a very gay man who claimed to be an ex-bf and wouldnt identify himself.  This was really disturbing for a lot of reasons.  But then when he identified himself I was really happy  it was Sholl!  (before nasty rumors get started, let me clarify that he is not, in fact, an ex).  I had heard nothing of that cat for maybe 5 years and then he runs into a mutual friends husband, gets my number, and just like that were in touch again.  Finally, yesterday I get together with an old friend Ive seen little of in the past few years and we played catch-up.  I dont know if you can count him as a long-lost friend exactly, but I also saw the white-haired karaoke m.c. guy that hosts all karaoke in the western metro, this weekend.  I hadnt seen him in long time, either.   Now I hear that Nick and Duda were spotted on the jumbo-tron.  Will wonders never cease?  Moral of the story?  I need to relocate.            "
"           DJS, the stories we could tell about those two clowns.  Don't even get HAL started...  So I had a very fruitful weekend.  What do I mean by 'fruitful'?  Let's just say Panda's back in the saddle again.           "
"           No way.  Nick AND Matt???  I can't believe it.         "
"            Another story:   I went to the Vikings game with Matt (a.k.a. my boyfriend) on Saturday. On the big Jumbotron TVs they show fans waving, etc. and guess who I saw?  Nick Reinbold and Matt Duda.   Duda in a charcoal grey turtleneck, and Nick in plaid.  Some things never change.         "
"           I just got the best xmas gift from my coworker!  As many of you know, I read  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  and loved it. I mean  loved  it. I had an emotional relationship with that book, and breaking up was hard to do.   My coworker Audrey knew this, and for Christmas she got me Dave Eggers' new book,  You Shall Know Our Velocity . Apparently there were only about 10,000 copies printed. She ordered it for me in October and even got it signed when he was in town.   I'm so excited!!!         "
"           OK Kiddies - who's working next week?  I am.  So I'll hopefully be able to give y'all the play-by-play of me staring at the wall 8 hours a day.  Have a great weekend.             "
"           Hal, I would think a serious sipper like yourself would want your latte to stay as hot as possible for as long as possible.   Room temperature coffee is just gross. Hot rocks. In regards to your questions:  1. You can feel the heat right through the java jacket. It's warmer. Try it.  2. I've never ordered an extra-hot latte and been disappointed. They're always plenty hot.  3. In the depths of winter, I prefer extra hot bevys. In summer, I go for standard temps.  4. & 5. When it comes to bevys, I don't concern myself with actual temperature numbers. That's more for weather and fevers than for coffee.  I predict that Hal will crumble and order an extra-hot latte sometime this winter, just to see what the hype is about.   Then she will be one of us.         "
"           Okay, so I've now located a resource to help me with the coffee-temp related questions I have!  First off, how do you tell between a 150-degree latte and an 160-degree latte?  Also, do you turn around and tell them to heat it up if it's unsatisfactory?  Or do you just let it go?  How do you arrive at said bevy temperature preference?  Do you find something too cool and put a thermometer in it for future reference?  Do you burn your tongue and figure that's 5 degrees too hot?  So many questions...         "
"           Okay coffee-drinkers and Duf...I finished my movie picks.  It might change, but for now I'm pretty comfortable with it.         "
"            We walk among you...   Hal, I've ordered my lattes extra-hot before. It comes in quite handy when you have a long drive ahead of you, and/or it's a cold day.  I think it's brilliant.         "
"           Disturbing new trend noted while getting my coffee this a.m. -   People who specify the temperature of their coffee as part of their drink order.  I first noticed this practice while in California a few months ago.  I thought it was a 'west coast thing' but apparently it's catching on.  Someone explain this to me.          "
"            BEST FILMS OF 2002   1.  Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers  - Okay, so I've already gushed about it, but it's quite simply one of the best movies ever.  I haven't been this excited for a movie series since I was a lil' shaver waiting for part 2 of Star Wars.  Yep.  It's that big to me, and this is coming from the dork who still has all of his Star Wars guys and a talking Yoda on his desk.  Was it really 3 hours?  Wow...I could've stuck around for 2 more hours...no problem.  2.  Signs  - Yeah, ol' Night M. Shamalamadingdong let me down a bit with his previous effort 'Unbreakable' but I was willing to give the cat another try.  Glad I did, because Signs ended up being one of the most intense movies I've seen in some time.  Yeah, the guy thinks he's the next Hitchcock and ends up using his 'but-wait-until-you-see-the-end-and-how-it-all-ties-together' gimmick, but friends...it works.  One of the most fun films I've seen in some time.  3.  Road to Perdition  - I'm a sucker for a good Sam Mendes flick...what can I say?  The guys got chops, baby.  From 'American Beauty' to this dark little number.  I'm sold, suckerhead.  Here's my legal tender.  Nothing quite like seeing Tommy Hanks in a bad guy role and seeing a crazy-as-all-getout ugly Jude Law working his silver screen magic.  If you haven't seen it...do it.  4.  The Good Girl  - I didn't want to see this, but I somehow got roped into it.  Damn...I'm glad I did.  As you may or may not know, I don't waste my 'precious' (the quotes are for you, HAL) time on TV, so I really never cared for any of the 'Friends' gang, but I'll be dashed if Jenny Aniston isn't a top-drawer actress.  Not the chick-flick I expected at all.  There were several moments when I just couldn't believe what was happening.  The movie wasn't designed to make you comfortable, but I think that's why I dug it so much.  5.  Bowling for Columbine  - I don't think I need to stress how much this movie has changed me.  What started as a huge mistrust of fear-generating news programs has turned to all out hatred.  I will never watch the news the same way again and I think ol' Chuck Heston and Rich Clark are a couple of the biggest celebrity assholes I've ever come across.  While I don't necessarily agree with everything Mikey Moore comes up with, I have a huge amount of respect for him.  If he released one of these types of flicks every year, I'd be in line to slap down some green.  I went and saw this with my dad...he's an instant Moore-fan.         "
"            For the Record; Stop the Presses; Yes, I Really Was   Panda - FYI, I never betrayed you (and I'm pretty sure the cock has crowed three times), so you can throw all these Judases out and we can run our blog as we see fit!  :)  Extra! Extra! Extra!  Read all about it - Stoner has a boyfriend!  All we need now are details.  So, let have them!  Nice try with the movie review diversion though.  I really was propositioned by a pro at Rainbow on Monday.  I was there to get bananas (Dr. Freud, where are you?), and this woman came up to me, her eyes red like the rose of a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and she asks me if I would like to go on a date.  I was tired, so I did not attempt a witty reply.  I just said 'okay.'  I mean 'no.'  I said 'no.'         "
"            Two Towers Y'all...   I've gotta second Stoner's glowing review of T3.  It was easily THE movie I was overly excited to see this year and it did not disappoint in the least.  I hadn't read the books before about a year and a half ago, but I made a point to read them at least a month before each of the movies came out.  I've still got to read Return of the King, but sweet Jesus, the sheer scope of these movies is unbelievable.  My mom bought me the big ol' DVD box set of Fellowship of the Rings a month or so back and when I brought it home Laura looked at it and said, 'Hmmm...doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in seeing.  I then told her she might want to clear out of the living room for a good 3.5 hours.  After it started playing, I could see the movie's effect work like a tractor beam on her.  In no time, she was completely engrossed.  Anyway...long story short: DJ Likey.  He likey a lot.  It's quite possible that this is going down as the best movie I've seen in years.  I'm seeing it again next week.   'My precious....we likes it!!!'          "
"            Stoner's First Movie Review  by Stoner  Last night I attended the second installment in the Lord of the Rings series. Never in a million years did I think I would be saying this - but that movie rocked.  For the past week or so, my boyfriend (as he is officially titled) and I have been watching The Fellowship of the Ring. He's a big fan and read all of the books, so he explained every little detail of the story. When I would fall asleep,  he would stop it - or let me sleep through the 'epic battle scenes' and wake me up for the important stuff.   That helped. Because I knew the basic story and all of the characters, I had a much easier time following this one. I heard it would be darker and more violent, but the story was so good that I didn't care. The characters that started out together in the first movie are now on a few separate quests, and each storyline is riveting.   Yes, Pandyland friends, I just used the word riveting.  Anyways, my point is it's good stuff. You'll be hearing a lot about a CGI actor named Gollum. And let me tell you, he really is amazing. I can't believe he wasn't real. He was definitely a scene-stealer.          "
"           Alright jerks.  I don't post for a few days and I get treated like a red-headed step child?  Do I have to start my own blog again?  I'm now in Chicago through Christmas.  It's soooo good to be home.  Although I had a kickin' weekend with my girls over last weekend.  We caught a show on Broadway on Saturday and a cheapskate frat boy on Friday.  That's right...the same one I talked about a few weeks ago.  Believe me, it wasn't my idea...it's my friend who's a glutton for punishment.  Don't even get me started about the cheap-ass moves this clown pulled. (i.e., ordering 2 bottles of the most expensive wine in the restaurant, only to make us pay for it when the bill came.)   So Billygoat was robbed in Guatemala today.  To directly quote his e-mail to me: 'A German guy and I got robbed today as we walked the shores of lake Atitlan. There were 3 14 year old kids with machetes. Unfortunately I lost my camera and a completed roll of film. The police came minutes later and tried to catch the thieves but the kids were faster.  I didn't lose much else or get hurt so don't worry. I am safely in Panajachel now. My passport was safe in the secret pocket.'  And to think I was going to travel with him for 6 months?  Blatant evidence that everything happens for a reason.              "

"           Duf,  Were you  really  propositioned again last night? I think you may have the world's record for number of times approached by a hooker.         "
"            I had some really great news today!   Hey everyone, I just found out that I am going to graduate fourth in my class from the  Minnesota Academy of Pimp Arts and Sciences, White Bear Lake Township Campus  (Est. 1976).  Here are my grades:  Pimp Hand:  strong to quite strong  Money gettin'... all of it:  96% (which is a B-)  Tricked out Subaru:  A+ (the 20'' dubz put me over the top, suckas said it couldn't be done; and my shit is hydralic too)  Attire:  B+  Pimp stroll:  A+  Pimp Lean:  A-  Be-atch pronunciation: C  Attendance: poor (which is an A-)  Timeliness: quite poor (which is an A)  The graduation ceremony is at the Rainbow Foods on Lake Street (where I was propositioned AGAIN last night) on Saturday at 1:00 a.m.  I hope you all can make it.

"           I thought I was going to die yesterday, or rather...wished I had.  Migraines do that to a person.  Well, if Pandy is really, truly dead...can we rename the blog ShoveLand?         "
"           Stoner, if you die it will mark an epidemic in Pandyland, as Pandy herself is surely dead.         "
"           Duf, I appreciate you looking out for me. Luckily, I survived the extreme Lysoling.  Today's concern: death by chocolate.   It's back.          "
"            Thirty Something Moment; Mostly Dead All Day   I cannot believe that I forgot to mention one album in my top five.  I blame DJS for not making it a top six list.  Anyway, I want to change my rankings so that I have a new number 4.  N*E*R*D moves to 5 and Jack moves to 6.  My new number four is:   Wilco  -  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  - If I could have a dream rock and roll band, if I could design a band to be any way I wanted it to be, I would not be the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin or even U2, I would be Wilco.  They are American rock and roll at its purest.  YHF is a brilliant addition to their discography.  Last, let me acknowledge that the Strokes disc may have come out in 2001, but it is a 2002 to me.  If you don't like it, then F ya'.  Also, Stoner, are you dead?  Just curious.           "
"            5; Disappointed; Low Post   My top five for the year (I spent all weekend thinking about it):  5.   Jack Johnson  -  Brushfire Fairytales  -  soulful, mellow, deceptively complex, funky, memorable, all around excellent with only one or two songs that are only slightly above-average instead of awesome.  4.   N*E*R*D*  -   In Search of ...- 'one day (one day) when I get older (oh-old-uh).  I'll start a family, get a job and go be a voter (vo-oh-tuh).'  Need I say more?  Warning:  for dirty dogs only.  3.   The Strokes  -  Is This It  - Pure rock and roll, I KNOW I will be listening to this years from now, and hey, it's not their fault they are the next big thing.  2.   Red Hot Chili Peppers  -  By the Way  - flawless, complex, funk/R&B, bold, experimental, confident, risk taking, mellow, intense, well-produced, all the things you would expect from musicians who have been around as long as some of the Peppers have been around.  A long disc that never grows tedious and in another time(...say pre-corporate radio) would have spawned at least 6 radio hits (maybe 7).  1.   Coldplay  -  A Rush of Blood to the Head  - Not one flaw.  Not one.  'God put a smile upon my face' by making music like this possible.  Flawless.  Sublime.  Everything:  religion, sex, ecstasy, heartache, redemption and good sangin'.  Best single of the year:   Tear  by  Red Hot Chili Peppers .  Worth the price of the disc.  You will all think I am a mellow nerd when you hear it (it has a horn section interlude), but it has all the climatic charm of a slow building 'o' and all the lingering power of being left high and dry, if you could somehow be thankful for the experience and want to do it over and over again; I played this at work about 25 times in a row one day.  It's addictive like heroine (or so I'm told...but I digress).  Biggest disappointment of the year:   Elvis Costello's  -  When I Was Cruel  - as a fan, perhaps I expected too much; but with the exception of a couple of tracks, it is completely forgettable and average.  I missed my Pandyland brothers and sisters last week.  Sorry for the low post.          "
"           If I'm dead tomorrow, it's because my coworker just Lysoled the room. She's preventing the spreading of germs. And the breathing of air.          "
"           Is everyone dead?  Me?  I'm tired.  I haven't been this tired since my caffeine days.         "
"           I like to shake my boo-tay.   Therefore, my five fave artists of 2002 were:    P. Diddy.  I cant believe J Lo hasnt responded at all to his pleas.   Busta Rhymes.  Pass me some Courvoisier.   Usher.  I dont think hes got it bad  I think hes got it good.   J. Timberlake.  He just wants to love me, baby.  (Tie)  Jay Z and Ja Rule.  I cant ever figure out which is which, so Ill go with both.   And the top  album of the year , courtesy of Duf, is by Dirty Vegas. I have no idea what its called. But its good.         "
"           I think I'm with Heather...haven't had much time or money lately to keep up with the trends...but for me:   Beck  - Sea Change Beck is extremely bummed out.  I think certain albums hit you because of the timing in when you listen to them.  Beck was talking about breaking up, I was breaking up...it just made sense.  On the whole, this is a pretty sophisticated album for him.  I never thought he'd ever break away from the 'I'm a Loser' genre...this album proves he has.  If you like a softer edge, more intelligent lyrics, more melodic vs. noise, you'll like it. Very well crafted.    Elvis #1 Hits  On the other end of the spectrum...if 'Little Less Conversation' doesn't make you want to dance around, then you must be in a coma.  Good ol' rock n' roll mixed with some sappy ballads.  The best single disc Elvis primer to date.   Doves  - The Last Broadcast The perfect album for all you Jeff Buckley, Coldplay, Radiohead, or Wilco fans out there.  This album is lush, melodic, poignant and cohesive. This was my first introduction to the Doves - having listened to this British album for the first time a few weeks ago in London, I immediately downloaded as much of their stuff as I could find after I got home.  Beautiful and different...impressive!              "
"           DJS is way more on the cutting edge than I.  I usually come around late to new stuff.  Rather than give you my top 5 albums of 2000/2001, Ill give you a few thoughts on 2002 music:  #1  Coldplay   A Rush Of Blood To The Head  .  HANDS DOWN.  I love those guys.  I also liked what I heard of John Mayer.  And Norah Jones has a great voice and a good album.  The most disappointing music release of the year was Beth Ortons   Daybreaker  .  I wore out her 1st 2 albums and even her EP.  I was really, really looking forward to her latest effort, but its just okay.  She better improve by next time, or she will have officially let me down.         "
"           Since we're coming up on the end of the year, why don't we start a series of BEST of 2002 lists?  We can do one a week until the end o' the year.  This week:  BEST 5 CDs of 2002  in no particular order.  1.  N.E.R.D  -  In Search Of...  These guys are all over the map.  One part R&B dance-y music, another part lyric mischief.  Not only are their songs catchy, very well produced and delicious, but they're pretty damn funny.  It's refreshing to listen to music that doesn't take itself so seriously.   Relax girl...sip some of my slurpee...   2.  Lo Fidelity All Stars  -  Don't Be Afraid Of Love  Yeah they're sort of a house/dance/techno band...but they're so much more.  After the loss of their lead singer (yes, they sing, too) the future looked bleak for the Lo-Fis.  No worries, mate.  Their newest effort is solid.  Rock solid.  If you're going on a road trip and you need a kick-ass soundtrack to drive to, scoop this one up.  3.  The White Stripes  -  White Blood Cells   So I've already sung their praises and I've only owned the CD a day and a couple hours.  If I've already listened to it like 8 times, does that tell you something?  I like their whole gimmick, too...pretending they're brother and sister when they're really ex-spouses.  Am I icky if I say I think Meg White is kind of cute in a gothy, creepy girl way?  Methinks no.  4.  EELS  -  Souljacker  Okay, so I learned about these guys backwards, buying their newest CD and working my way back.  Shit...I even bought a burrito for HAL in exchange for their debut album.  Well worth every inch of tortilla.  Their newest (and consequently my oldest) effort is a kick in the mouth of crazy-ass beats, sound lyrics and mouth-watering rhythm.  C'mon...in the first song entitled 'Dog Faced Boy' the chorus is...  Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me...  Pure bearded genius.  5.  Emiliana Torrini  -  Love In The Name Of Science  Well...technically this CD came out in 1999, but I got it late last year and...well, I still can't get enough of it.  She's from Iceland (big bonus!) and I saw her open up for Dido at the Xcel Energy Center.  Considering she didn't have much in the way of a set-up for playing such a huge venue, I was totally blow away by her.  One part Bjork and one part Dido is the best way to descibe it and that still doesn't give her justice.  Anyway...not an easy album to find, I had to bribe the woman at Tower Records in Philidelphia to sell me her copy...but well worth the effort.         "
"             From the 'Yeah...We Already Know' Department...    I just snapped up the CD from  The White Stripes  yesterday.  The verdict?  This DJ likey.  He likey a lot.  I had it in my hand at Target and as I perused the aisles of quality products at reasonable prices, I hemmed and hawwed about getting it.  I knew like 2 songs on the CD and since I was late to jump on the band wagon, it was priced to own at $14.99 (which I think is a bit steep).  On my way back toward the video games, I decided to put it back.  When I did, I set it on another shelf for a clerk to put reshelve later.  Little did I know, but I managed to put it near some other CD offerings...one of which was, you guessed it:  The White Stripes.  Only this one was different.  For a mere $13.99 (that's $1 in savings) not only did you get the CD, but you also got a DVD with 4 (count 'em 4) videos and 2 unreleased songs on it.  Sold.  I can't stress how cool these cats are.  Loud, sloppy rock with the just the right amount of lyrical wit and genius.  If you love Justin Timberlake and glossily produced stuff, you'll HATE this.  It's a contender for best CD of the year in my book... which gives me an idea!         "

"           My place of employment is looking pretty sad today.  We had a holiday potluck. There were lots of cookies and pasta salads.

"           A few thoughts on Mariah Carey and the Today show  For those who may not know, Mariah Carey performed live from the Mall o America on the Today show this morning.  Al Roker (yum!) and Matt Lauer (sure) also were at the event.  Sadly, Ann and Katie stayed in New York.  I watched a bit of the show, though I missed the live performance (sniff, sniff).  It was the pope coming to bless the cathedral.  People were kissing Mariahs ass - you would have thought that Bono himself was there!!  Its always a weird thing to see her interact with her fans  Ive never seen someone more condescending, so much so that its painful to watch.  When Matt asked her why she was there to perform she said very sincerely that it was to be with the people.  Ew...  Anyway, its also what people around town (alright, in the elevator and the break room) are talking about.  Its funny that everyone says the EXACT SAME thing  I would have gone to see Matt and Al, but Mariahs not my thing.  And then I think about a rotunda of people chanting MATT. AND. AL!!, MATT. AND. AL!! and then they take the stage, and everyone goes nuts          "

"           DJS, glad to hear you saw Frida!  HAL heard this story first-hand, but just to give y'all a quick recap:  I went out with the girls on Saturday night...the same time my parents were staying at my place because they went to see an opera on Saturday in Chicago.    I drank way too many margaritas, as well as some sort of red shot, lots of Newcastle, and zambooka.  Damn zambooka.  The night involved the above drinks, a sweet jukebox, an extremely friendly Irishman, a guy who looked like one of the singers in the Barenaked Ladies, and a computer programmer with a girlfriend (the one guy  I  decide to talk to all night, btw.  And, I don't remember his name.)  To make a long story short...I stumbled into my studio apartment at 1am, went into the bathroom, and puked.  And to remind you, my parents were sleeping over...so they heard and saw everything.  My mom played the sympathy ticket: 'Oh honey, I feel so sorry for you...'  While my dad was a smart ass as usual: 'Too much medicine, huh?  *laughs under breath*'  I mumbled something and got into bed...the next day, as death warmed over me, mom and dad got me up at 7am to go to mass.  Oh my Lord.  I've never felt more like ass...ever.  The one time I go out hard core in about  two years  and my parents spend the night.  Good grief.           "
"           What up Pandyland?  A couple of you cats know I write and of those that know, a couple also know that I sent my story to two kids to read and send me back a review.  Let me explain...I've been involved with some online Children's Book Author groups (that haven't been much help) and I always get e-mails and stuff from other groups who'd like me to join their groups.  Well...I got an e-mail from a guy a couple weeks back that told me about a service he and his kids were providing.  For the low price of $7 each, I can have his kids (a 2nd grader & a 3rd grader) read my 320 page manuscript and do a pretty thorough critique of it.  At first I was skeptical, but then I thought: 'Ehh...what the hell.'  I sent it off and thought I'd hear back from them in a week or two.  Nope.  Review #1 came in today.   BTW  - I saw 'Frida' on Saturday.  Loved it!  Who knew lil' Selma had it in her?         "
"           Wow - DJS, you're my favorite.  LOVE the page.  Stoner, I'd post this in Comic Sans if I could (kidding!).  I'm never to be taken seriously (seriously!).

"           I have another work gripe that I need to express - font usage.   What's with the people who write corporate memos in Comic Sans? No matter what the message says, I read 'please don't take anything written in this memo seriously. If I had crayons, I would be using them right now. Because that is cute. And so am I.'  It's like I'm working with Charlie Brown.         "

"           Okay...I gotta come clean.  It's sweeps week in Bloggerville and I thought I'd stoke the fires a bit to get better ratings here on Pandyland.  Yes, I'm a ratings whore.  As you know from my visits to  other  sites I enjoy the occasional nudge and believe me, I knew I'd get some backlash for my remarks on Bono's profound statements in Iowa.  I like the gadge (not everything he says) and I really do like U2.  Duf couldn't have nailed it more precisely with his insightful summary of both Bjork and Bono.  I never intended to drag Bjork into this, but alas...all is fair in love and etc...  Can't we all just get along?   (djs hears the crowd murmur: yeah...if you wouldn't ever post anymore, we could...)          "
"            Pandymonium in Pandyland?   Okay now wait a minute.  As a U2 fan and a Bjork fan (even a Sugarcubes fan), I have to come in and stop this insanity.   Bono is an artist.  For that matter, in my opinion, anyone who creates anything is an artist.  If you make shitty clay ashtrays, you are an artist.  Let's recognize him as such.  But more than that, in my opinion (and I recognize these things are subjective), he is an  exceptional  artist.  To me, his contribution is more in poetry than in quality of voice.  Though he may not have Bjork's multi-insturment gifts, you have to give him credit for a wide variety of lyrics that put him in a category that most artists can only dream of.  He has been anthemic, soulful, silly, subtle, profane, and his portrayals of America (and I hope this does not overstate it) remind me, for their realism and love, of Nabakov's  Lolita .  His lyrics touch on religion, politics, love, history, struggle, pop culture, man, everything.  And think of all the banal lyrics there are today.  Think of how hard it is to be inventive and to go outside of yourself.  Think how hard it is to create before millions for twenty years, knowing that some people love you and never want you to change, but that change is required if you are going to be on the scene for that long.    Also, we really must not fault him for his political actions.  It is, IMHO, always wrong to chide people for trying to make the world better.  He is high profile, and everything he does will get attention, so all of his actions will seem self-serving to an extent, but considered against the alternative - doing nothing - I hope he continues to speak out even though it means he will be criticized.  Now for Bjork.  She is an artist of the highest order.  Her musicianship is genius.  Her lyrics are sublime, and the combination is breathtaking.  What she wears, why she hits people, her strange videos, they are all a function of her genius.  And I would totally date her anytime ever.  Wifey has already given me permission.    I guess what I am saying is that these things are usually subjective, but should never be an 'either or proposition.'  Also, there should never be a compeition.  Who is the better artist is always a silly question.  However, who would you rather sleep with is not.  And for me, it is Bjork (it's close, but Bjork edges out Bono because I've seen her nude and she is easier to visualize).         "
"           Too bad it had to come to this - DJS, you're off my salt bagel list.         "
"           Oh yeah?  This is why I'm   NOT   friends with her.  Not anymore.         "
"           DJS, word of advice: don't  ever  challenge HAL on any piece of U2 trivia.  She knows everything there is to know about the band.  That's why I'm friends with her.         "
"           DJS,  I'd love to share set lists with you (seriously, I would).  But to keep it brief, yes, they did play 'old stuff' on the Popmart and Zoo TV/Zooropa tours.  'I Will Follow' was played on both tours (from their original album) as was 'the hits' from 'War', 'The Unforgettable Fire', and 'The Joshua Tree'.  I think you're thinking of the drastic overall difference between their concerts of the '80s and their concerts of the '90s.  Popmart/Zoo TV, etc were flashy, multi-media spectacles (and great f--king shows) that were a big contrast from the simple '4 guys on stage' concerts that they did in the '80s.  Plus, they were playing stadiums vs. theaters.  Lots of people balked, and U2 was like 'deal with it'.  But they always had a diverse set list.  Anyway... just go to a show when they are in town again.  You'll thank me for it.  Though I'm not sure if Larry will take of his shirt again.  That was just special.         "
"            HAL:  Did you see U2 perform during their Popmart/Zooropa days?  They may have rescinded their statement since then, but I'm quite sure they boycotted performing their earlier efforts (read: their hits) for a period a while back.         "
"           Wow, I've never seen such long posts since....oops, again...wrong site.  And to think  Stoner  somewhat 'caused' this bit of controversy with her subtle rip on the Icelandic imp.  I love it!  For the record, I like Bono  and  Bjork.  But I do have to say I enjoy Bono as part of the band more than a spokesperson by himself...if only he was on this Midwestern AIDS round-up with the Edge (instead of Chris Tucker, that guy totally bugs)...then I actually might take him seriously.  By the way, I'm planning my next big international trip next year...to Iceland.  I can't think of anything cooler than Bjork's hot-spring-filled homeland...it's somewhere I've always wanted to go.  Anyone want to tag along?             "
"           I can't disagree with what people are saying here.  I just have to take small exception with the  claim  that Bono said he won't play old stuff - there's been stuff from 'Boy' or 'October' (circa '80-'81), at almost all the shows I've been to, and they ALWAYS play stuff from 'War' (1983) and every subsequent albumn at every show.  And I certainly don't disagree that Bono is 'a guy with a microphone and an agenda', after all, I love that about him.  Same goes with the charge of cheesy-ness.  He's guilty - guilty of being earnest!  Em I buggin' ya?...  I also agree that Bjork was being subversive and rebellious at the Oscars.  No one in their right mind actually thought she put that on thinking 'this will fit in with any Vera Wang out there'.  But it was a bizarre and flaky thing to do.  I also loved it when the South Park guys arrived at the Oscars dressed in J-Lo and Gwyneth dresses.  It was weird and obnoxious.  But I laughed really hard, and its the only thing I remember anyone wearing from that year, plus, we're still talking about it, so it was genius.  Bottom line, U2 fans have to live with the fact that Bono can be perceived as pompous, and Bjork is a freak.  But they dont have to accept those as bad things.   I just hope this doesn't all come down to someone getting booted.  Er, wrong site...         "
"           Okay...now the gloves are coming off.   Bono:  an egomaniac who seems to be pulling out all stops to get himself a Nobel Peace Prize and also the a-hole at one time who said something to the effect of: 'F the fans...we're not playing our old stuff anymore' all the while trying to cram Pop Mart and Zoo TV garbage down people's throat.   Bjork:  a musical genius.  Is her stuff as catchy as U2's?  No, nor does it need to be.  With every song she's ever recorded, she comes up with a completely distinct and different sound than her previous efforts.  As for the easy cheap shot EVERYONE makes about the swan dress, here's what I have to say: How dare she wear anything other than Prada or a Bob Mackie dress?  This was the   OSCARS   we're talking about!  Ugh!  On a red carpet full of people spinning around to show off their $50,000 dollar dresses that designers gave to them to wear, Bjork showed up in a dress her friend made and was pretty funny about it.  Of course, she didn't expect the backlash she got from the press and every other automoton that watched the awards.  Her response to it all?  She wore it again (how dare she!) on the cover of her album 'Vespertine.'  Tre cool in my book.  Okay...I can see this escalating in an all-out Pandyland brawl.  For the record, I like some of U2's music and I actually think Bono is okay.  I merely pointed out what I thought was a very corny little statement on his part.  I appreciate what he's trying to do, but he needs to stop acting like he's Jesus Christ with his prophetic words of wisdom.  All in all, it's hard to call Bono an artist.  He's a guy with a microphone and an agenda.         "
"           I'm sorry I missed out on this argument yesterday, but I really feel I must contribute my unbiased opinion to the Bono vs. Bjork discussion.   Bono: a man with a smoldering, sexy voice, who despite his age makes leather pants look like the best idea ever.   Bjork: a woman with a voice that is alternately shrieky and raspy, who despite common sense once wore a stuffed swan dress.  So which 'artist' is superior? Hmmm...it's such a tough call...         "
"           Cool, so you've seen 'Rattle and Hum'.  I've got a heart condition, so I'm only supposed to watch it infrequently.         "
"           Bjork...flaky?  Them's fightin' words!  I'm not trying to start a riot, but it just reminded me of the  'Am I buggin' you?  I don't mean to bug ya.'  pharse.  It's right up there with  'This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles...we're stealin' it back.'          "
"           Sorry, DJS... I don't get your 'Bono can be corny' argument.  But are you surprised?  Bono could pinch my cheek and tell me I'm  'cute as a button', and I'd find it profound and intensely original.  And as long as you don't push the issue with Bono, I won't tell you that Bjork is flaky.          "
"           Okay...I know some of you Pandy-ites love Bono, but this excerpt from an article (sent in by Moses Oatmeal) is just...plain...corny...   Award-winning musician Bono and actress Ashley Judd stopped in Iowa  City on Monday to plant a movement in some of the world's best soil.    Joined by an American AIDS expert, an HIV-infected African activist,  and a Ghanan musical group, the stars educated and attempted to inspire a  bubbling IMU crowd of more than 2,000 to fight the epidemic, which  kills 6,500 sub-Saharan Africans each day. Approximately 29 million  Africans are infected with the disease.    'I'm told you can grow anything here,' said Bono, who shed his  trademark leather jacket and wrap-around shades for the event. 'We're here to  grow a movement.'   Man...how long did it take him to draft that catchy little phrase???  (to read the whole delicious article, check the Pandyland e-mail box)         "

"            Bringing everyone down.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?   Yoda.  Im not sure why he was such a prominent figure in my childhood social circle probably had a lot to do with the fact that he talked/looked funny.  We used to spend a lot of time around the pond behind my parents house, and there was a place there that we called Yodas Bathroom.  I dont know why we gave him a bathroom, and no one else.  I also dont know why we didnt give him things like a bedroom, or a kitchen.  But Im sure it made sense at the time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Grandparents.  They all died when I was pretty young.  Im often told that Im like my dads mother, which makes me happy and sad - she died before I was born.  The thing is, a relative inevitably tells me a story about when she was scamming or pawning something, or when she confronted some strange kid about being a greedy little bastard, or her habit of talking to paintings on the wall as if they were her (dead) sisters.  Then that person says, You remind me a lot of her.  Ive got a lot to look forward to.  This reminds me, earlier this week I was watching a morning program and they were showing this piece about a little kid (about 4?) whos favorite thing to do (aside from suction-cupping things to his stomach) is to take helium balloons to a nearby hillside and send them to his dead grandma.  She died when he was 2 years old, so he doesnt even really remember her.  I just lost it.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Literally Prague?  Figuratively probably when I slept over at a friends house and her dad came home drunk and a little belligerent, so we hid upstairs.  It was apparently something she was really used to and I was really not used to.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   To keep the old trap shut.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?  Gearing up for a week away - Im a nester so I like preparation.  That aside, social highlights include bowling/karoke Saturday and a church-shopping expedition on Sunday.           "
"            And the dark horse...     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    I liked Spiderman.  I think the fact that he was a kid who got bitten by a spider was cool to me when I was a little.  My brother on the otherhand, liked the Hulk the best.  Maybe it was little brother syndrome...then again, he was also pretty fond of Wonder Woman too.  I never did get the Spiderman underoos, but got a nice olive drab set of Yoda ones.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    A BB gun.  I had an uncle who got me this scarecrow dart gun set where you shot these rubber sucker-darts at this plastic scarecrow who exploded if you shot him in the chest.  It had other targets, too, but...you know.  We played with it for one day and it mysteriously disappeared, guns and all.  I always wanted to get a BB gun so I could go out and hunt stuff in the backyard.  Never got one...that is, until my brother bot me a BB handgun a couple years ago.  By then, I didn't want to hunt.  Figures.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   When I lived in Los Angeles for 9 months.  It was pretty hard for me and my family.  While I loved living there and working in the industry that I did, it was weird not having the people I was really close with nearby.  When my brother and his girlfriend visited, I felt bad.  I couldn't visit with him for very long and when he left I cried like a little bitch.  Like real hard sobs...or like the Scottish would say: I was greetin' like a bairn.    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    How to play a musical instrument.  I had a bass guitar years ago and played the damn thing once.  My 'band' and I recorded our first song, the instrumental 'Burning Down the Ghetto' and that was pretty much the end of it.  I did get an acoustic guitar over a year ago, but I haven't had a chance to learn to play it yet.  I did make some effort, however.  I bought a 'The Complete Idiots Guide to Playing the Guitar.'  How sad is it that I still don't know how to play the thing?    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Going bowling with some friends and their little daughters and then eating.  Heading out to dirty ol' Mankato so I can look at the place where we're having the reception and also to check out some other potential photographers.  Of all the details I'm the most picky about, it's the picture-takers.  We saw one guy who just took them with a regular camera and get this: let's you keep the negatives.  No thanks, pally.  They looked like any retarded cousin could've taken the shots.  Let's just say I've been put in charge of who does our pictures.  Sunday I work at the bookstore and I plan to work on getting my stuff ready to submit to publishers/agents.         "
"            I like Fridays.     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    Definitely Wonder Woman. I was so jealous of the next door neighbor with the Wonder Woman underoos. She got to wear a fancy tiara and bracelets and flashy clothes, and was tough and fought crime at the same time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    Makeup. For Christmas I always wanted makeup or hair accessories or stuff like that, but girliness wasn't completely encouraged in my family. I am just now coming out of my girly-repression funk. And spending a lot of money on nail polish.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   I spent Christmas with a bunch of Italian people one year, and was very homesick. Only one or two of the people spoke English - so even though the others were trying to be nice and talk to me, I couldn't understand what they were saying. Then my family called, and they were all together and sounding like they were having fun (and speaking in my own language). I was lonesome...in a crowd...very sad...    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    Spanish. I took it in high school, and wish I had continued in college. Instead, I wasted my time on things like Economics and Accounting. I wouldn't have been able to go on the London Business Semester with Panda though, if I hadn't minored in business...    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Tomorrow I get to go to my boyfriend's holiday party for work. It goes from 5 pm to midnight, and there is a dance...I think I will be tired when it is done. On Sunday we'll go to my niece's 2nd birthday party. And on Monday we're playing hooky and doing fun stuff all day instead of working. I like him...  So, Duf, where does the Friday Five come from?         "
"            Being Proactive with the Friday 5, yo.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?  Does Smurfette count as a superhero?  Because she rocks.  She lives in this village of  all men  and just flirts to get her way.  Shes the ultimate woman/blue creature.   2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?  Off hand, I cant think of anything I wanted for myself.  (On the same wavelength as Duf) My brother wanted a go-kart since the moment he could talk.  So sometimes I would ask my parents for a go-kart for Christmas/Birthdays since I thought Id have more seniority or something because I was older.  That never worked.  We never got a go-kart.  When my cousin did we were green with envyand that bitch never let us drive it.  That still makes me mad.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Bangkok & Chaing Mai/Rai in Thailand  the most gorgeous place on earth.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?  Ive always wanted to learn an Asian language, but I dont know if Id have the patience for it.  And I still need to learn to drive stick.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?   Whats with this question every week?  Im going to see a punk show tonight at the Elbo Room, looking at a condo (possible purchase??) on Saturday, Comedy Sportz tomorrow night, movie on Sunday.  O-u-t...out!          "

He could talk to the animals, and he could swim like a darn dolphin.  He had a great looking butt.  He was the complete package.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Affection.  Just kidding.  I'd have to say go-cart, Bob.  A go cart or affection.  Yep.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   Where ever I go, I take Kansas with me.  I'm never away from home, y'all (there's no place like it...it's where the heart is...it's sweet home...it's on the range where the deer and the antelope play).    4.

"            A trashy saga...   To HAL's point #3 - in our apartment building, we have to bring garbage to the dumpsters in our garage. At least they started in our garage. Then they were moved outside. Many people complained (for the record, a lot are elderly, so I see where the problem could be) and now they have moved them back into the garage. I guess the fire department says they have to be in their own room, however, with a door that closes and latches.   Thus, our ingenious apartment management company built a dumpster-closet, with walls that go from the floor to the ceiling. It freaks the hell out of me. It's pitch dark in there - apparently one of the stipulations is that the room can have no light - and there is plenty of room for rapists and murderers to hide. It's perfectly convenient. After they kill you, they can dump your body right away.  And that is why I don't take out the trash.         "
"            Moses was right, I need to do this -     1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  Is there anyone out there who has only one thing they dont like about their body?  Alright, Ill go with my midget-jaw.  Its far too small (or the rest of my face is far too big), and because of that, I dont like my face in profile, at all.    2. What are two things you love about your body?   I finally have an appreciation for my height (for the record, the last time I checked I am somewhere between 510 and 511).  I had a hard time with it in adolescence, but now I dont mind it when people ask me to grab something off the high shelf at Target.  Its also a major foundation of my faith, as when I was a yougn I literally used to pray to God that I would not be 6 tall or taller.  The exception is that Im still not used to the really weird comments (among several odd experiences, Ive had a stranger inform me that Im lucky Im so tall, because no man will lie to me, as he has to look me in the eye) that I get.  Im also a fan of my feet, which explains my shoe and pedicure expense problems.   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I dont like many of the people in our building, including, but not limited to:  the freaks across the hall, the loud bastards below us, and the weird, haggard, drifter-type guy who lives somewhere else in the building.  I miss having a garbage shoot like I did in my old building (much more convenient for refuse-removal), and finally, I miss having a garbage disposal (also a convenience in refuse removal).    4. What are four books you want to read this year?   I dont plan that far in advance.  But I would like to finish the 6 or so books that I have partially-read.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Wow, Im not nearly that well thought-out.  Nor am I much of a goal-setter.  I have promised myself that I will never drink that much again, but then broken that promise.  I would like to travel to all 50 states in my lifetime (so far, about 30 are down).

It stank like usual Steven Soderbergh fare and I was just informed last night that part of the deal they made with the studios is that ol' Stevie got final edit rights on the film, so he could make it into his usual yawn-fest.  While I didn't HATE the movie, it didn't leave much of a lasting impression on me.  Plus, it had my least favorite actress in there: horse-faced Julia Roberts.  I wish George Clooney would cut his apron strings and do projects other than what Soderbergh gets him involved in...he's slowly starting to bug the shit out of me.  Now...if you want to see a great movie, one of the year's best (or was it last year?) go and see the movie  NARC  with Ray Liotta and Jason Patric.  Awesome movie.  Gritty, powerfully acted, loaded with some pretty startling imagery.  I just saw it last night and I'm still kind of buzzing from it.  Saw a preview for the movie The Core.  Now THAT movie is going to suck.  Sample dialogue:   'The earth is going to split in half.  There's no way we can stop it.'  'What if we could?'          "

"            The At Least It's Not Wednesday Yet Five:    1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  I wish I were a little more fit. I still think of myself as an athlete (because of high school and college) and thus being able to eat as much as I want whenever I want, but am pretty much a lazy bum these days.   2. What are two things you love about your body?   I have plenty of thick, healthy hair on my head - without having thick, unruly hair on my arms or face. Is that two?   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I wish it was free. I wish it would clean itself. I wish it was right next door to where Matt lives.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?    You Shall Know Our Velocity  by Dave Eggers, since I got it for Christmas and like the first four pages so far. Also, I'd like to finish reading the other books I purchased last year, such as  The Corrections . I'm looking forward to taking a day off to read the new Harry Potter book non-stop once it comes out. And maybe I should read that cheese book, because I'm unhappy at work.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   A long time ago, my swimming coach taught me that the only thing in life I truly  have to  do is die (followed up by a conversation about whether you  have to  go to the bathroom or not, or if it will kill you if you don't...but that's a story for another time) so I haven't made many promises to myself. I like the idea though, and intend to make five promises to myself right now.         "

"             Tuesday Five: A little slow on the pick-up     1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  The paleness of my skinin winter Im almost transparent.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?  That I can put my body through hell and back and it keeps on tickin. My gorgeous toes.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?  I wish I had more room. I need more space. Did I mention I live in the smallest studio apartment on Lakeshore Dr??   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?  I dont remember the last time I picked up the Bible.  Fast Food Nation  by Eric Schlosser To keep reading  Who Moved My Cheese  by Spencer Johnson when I start to feel out of control.  Why There Are No Good Men Left: The Romantic Plight of the New Single Woman  by Barbara Whitehead (Just kidding)   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Pay off my graduate student loan before I get married.  Thank God the wedding didnt happen in November, because I just made the last payment last week. To remember my friends (and mothers) birthdays. To stand by my convictions, no matter how unpopular: i.e., Im probably the youngest (and only) Republican I know in Chicago.  To surround myself with music and to keep playing the guitar since I cant fit a piano in my tiny house. To eat whatever I like and not feel guilty about it.          "
"           First off:  Edgeville Rocks.  Second of all, this is the toughest [Monday] Five ever.   1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?   Easy:  my weight.  So sad that the thing I don't like is a thing I can control.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?   I think I have beautiful feet. That golden hair that grows out of my forehead.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?   The address. The size. The lack of jacuzzi/hot tub.   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?   The Hours by Michael Cunningham Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer (guessing on spelling) The Brothers Karamazov Naked by David Sedaris   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   Listen to New Year's Day every New Year's Day.  Get out of debt (and then).  Live below my means.  Love my friends even if they are wrong and do things that hurt others (or me).  I have done wrong things, and I have hurt others, and though I never did it on purpose, I needed the love of friends to see me through.  Ooops...too heavy.  Devote myself to writing; but not to the exclusion of what matters.  Never give voice to  that , no matter how much I want to.           "
"            Monday Five - DJS Version 1.0     1. What is one thing you don't like about your body?    1.  I'm getting gray much too soon.  I'm only 30 for crissakes!    2. What are two things you love about your body?    1.  I like my nose.  It's just the right size and isn't too pointy or weird looking.  Plus, the nostrils are just the right size for my fingers in case I have to do some quick excavating.    2.  My ears aren't bad either.  The cartiledge has stayed pretty solid and I don't have big Dumbo ears or anything.    3. What are three things you want to change about your home?    I'd like to (when we get a bigger place):   1.  Build a darkroom for photography and such.   2.  Design the ultimate office for writing and research.  When I get the book deal, I'd love to have that ready and waiting.    3.  I want to add a kid or two (or three) to the home.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?      1.  Return of the King    2.  Black House    3.   Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix    4.  Edgar Allen Poes Complete Tales    5.  The Thief Lord    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?     1.  Never sacrifice happiness for anything.   2.  To continue writing until I die.    3.  To never smoke filthy cigarettes or take any sort of illegal drugs.  (go ahead, call me square)    4.  To visit ancient places sometime.    5.   To never forget those who are important to me.         "

"           Friends,  Let me make it plain.  I did not like  'On The Road' , and because of that, I've never bothered with any other Jacky Kerouac books.  F him.  For some reason (and it could be the time when I read it) the book did absolutely nothing for me.  Admittedly, I don't read much in the way of high-brow literature.  I kind of read junky books (mystery thrillers, kids books, Irvine Welsh) so I'm not what someone would call 'well read' and it's probably because I'm not really impressed with literature for art's sake.  I just like a good story.  When I read  'On The Road'  I didn't think it was a good story.  I've never been a big fan of the 'beat nation' writings and I swear I was going to get sick if I had to read about this clown going back and forth across the country one more time.  I really wanted to like his stuff.  I mean, the Beastie Boys dig him, so why shouldn't I?  Alas...it was not to be.  Now J.D. Salinger?  Me likey.         "
"           DJS,  FYI: I have not even read  The Fountainhead .  But I like Jack Kerouac too.  Since you like his writings, I would suggest reading his biography  Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac .  It takes a good look at his tortured psyche... I think you would enjoy it.  Cheers, Panda         "
"           So I picked up a copy of Jack Kerouac's  On the Road  at the airport.  And I paid more for it than a book of this sort should cost.  I always think that  On the Road  should be like tarot cards.  The kind of thing you are not supposed to buy but are supposed to just happen upon.    I know this book is one that you either love or hate, and, if memory serves, DJS is in the hate camp. But, to me, I can tell you that, 1/3 of the way into the book, it will definitely be a favorite of mine.    As I have been reading it, on planes and in airports, people have come up to me and commented.  It's a community building book.  Here is an excerpt that stuck with me.  There are others that stuck with me more, but it would take a long time to type them, and after my lengthy post earlier this week...  'He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con man, he was only conning because he wanted so much to live and to get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him.  He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and 'how to write', etc.) and he knew I knew (this has been the basis of our relationship), but I didn't care and we got along fine - no pestering, no catering; we tiptoed around each other like heartbreaking new friends.'  To me, the book is a love letter to America, and it is poetry.  I may end up liking it like Panda likes  The Foutainhead .         "

It takes place in London and youget to play as a vigilante cop who is on the wrong side of the law.  Yeah!  The best part, is that the instruction booklet has a definition for some of the 'slang' they speak.  I had no idea that they called the Police 'The Filth.'  Wow.  Now it makes sense why Irvine Welsh's book 'Filth' featured a picture of a pig with a bobby helmet on.  The other nice part is that the game is rated 'M' for mature.

"           I'm staying at Le Parker Meridien this week.  Last night the fire alarm went off at about 4am.

"           So it's pretty timely  and  coincidental that I just saw '25th Hour' on Sunday night: a movie about a guy facing a 7-year prison term.  I'd say Edward Norton shows us his best performance YET as Monty Brogan, a pretty decent guy...who happens to deal drugs.  Some fantastic commentary on post-9/11 New York.  If you see it, pay close attention to the scene where his own reflection yells at himself about the various ethnic groups scattered throughout NYC.  The audience roared...  So why is it so eerie that I just saw this?  To make a long story short: I just found out Billygoat is going to the Big House for a few days next week to make-good on a little mishap that occurred about 3 years ago.  Granted it's no 7-year term, but I still told him he better 'watch his back' while he's there...if you know what I mean.  He wasn't amused.  And to think I could have had conjugal visits?          "

"            Prologue:   Let me start by saying that I like Pandyland best when it is madcap and silly.  My plan is to go right back to my madcap self right after this really, really, long post.  Still, I really want to get something off my chest, and I think this might be the forum for doing it.  So, pardon me for my response to President Bush's recent decision to oppose the diversity plan used by the University of Michigan to increase the enrollment of minority students.  If you don't want to read this lengthy post, please don't.  I promise not to write like this very often.     Overview Comments:   1.  I am not necessarily a proponent of affirmative action.  I think we are close to the point in our society where race is not a prohibitive barrier.  It is a barrier, but I feel that for most people of color (especially middle class and up people of color), it is surmountable.  In my view, socio-economic status matters more than race.  I would much rather belong to any racial or ethnic group and be middle class than be white and poor.  Although I have encountered racism in my life, I have been fortunate and have been able to just consider it the misguided misgivings of misanthropes.    Also, affirmative action programs leave minorities in a precarious place.  Minorities feel that they are perceived as underqualified, and they may feel pressure to prove that they belong.  Not an easy burden to bear, let me tell you.  2.  With the exception of about 50 schools, I think, particularly at the undergraduate level, colleges and universities are about the same.  As a youngster, I had the great good fortune of attending two colleges, one of average reputation (Kansas University, my alma mater) and one of stellar reputation (Georgetown University).  Now, I'm not naive, and I understand that prestige paper has its blessings, but when I consider the quality of education I received at both institutions, I'm hard pressed to say that one was better (academically) than the other.  I can say that I was more inspired,  on the whole , by the intelligence of my fellow students and Georgetown, but I might actually argue that the students at Kansas worked harder (and trust me, there were plenty of kids at old KU who could have gone to any school in the country).  I know for a fact that grade inflation is more alive and well at Georgetown than it is at KU.    Anyway, it is hard for me not to see, to some extent, much of the conversations about Affirmative Action as really being 'I'm chapped that I can't get into Yale.'  Again, I definitely see that there is a value to having a degree from the ivies, the seven sisters or the blue-chip schools.  But, at the same time, it is hard for me not to say:  'okay, you didn't get into Michigan.  Go to Michigan State or Ohio State or the University of Vermont.'  Can this conversation be about more than people feeling like they should get into whatever school they want all the time?  I bet most people who applied to multiple schools, can relate experiences that seem odd (when I applied to law school, I got in to two top fifteen schools:  Cornell and the University of Texas, but did not get in to the University of North Carolina - a school that was then just outside of the top 25; go figure.).  3.  Much has been said about how being from a select racial or ethnic group is worth 20 points in the admissions program at Michigan - the same number of points awarded to students who get a perfect 1600 on the S.A.T.  Without getting in to it too much, let me say:  'so what?'  Being an athelete is worth 20 points too, but I don't hear anyone saying 'Craig Krenzel took my spot at Ohio State - I think that is totally unfair!'  [note to Pandylanders:  Craig Krenzel is the quarterback of the Ohio State football team.  Ohio State won the national championship this year for the first time since 1968.  Craig Krenzel is white.]   My Beef with George:   1.  I see this as being about more than a University's right to allocate points to assure diversity within its student population.  Colleges and universities have criteria that favor a lot of different classes.  You get points for being an athelete, a musician, an Eagle Scout (even though it is a discriminatory organization - a different rant for a different day), a citizen of a less than populous state, graduating from a prestigious high-school, graduating/surviving from a really shitty school, being a legacy (having parents who went to the school where you are applying), being the child of someone famous, beign the child of someone wealthy, completing highly-regarded academic programs (like the I.B. program), writing a strong essay, doing well on a standardized test, being from a specialized racial group, or being gay or lesbian among other things.  Why target just one criterion?  If it is permissible to say that a school should take effort to make sure that kids from North Dakota get in, why is it impermissible for a school to take efforts to make sure kids from diverse racial backgrounds get in?  For those who oppose the criterion, how do you know your place was taken by a minority, and not, say by a kid who plays a mean clarinet?  Given that admissions is as much an art as it is a science, can we ever know with certainty who displaced who?    By the way, one could argue that among the criterion above, most allow greater access for non-minorities:  for example, there are disproportionately few minority Eagle scouts (and even fewer  gay  Eagle Scouts; and absolutely NO women Eagle Scouts), there are few minorities in Wyoming, legacy programs disporporitionately favor non-minorities, and so on.    2.  George Bush was a 'C' student at Yale and gained admission into the Harvard M.B.A. program.  While this does not preclude him from coming down against affirmative action; he must yield to concerns that this is a fine time for him to start working toward fair admission standards (not to mention wondering about when he will go after some of the other unfairnesses that characterize our college acceptance processes).  3.  With the exception of historically black institutions, there is no university in the United States, that I am aware of, that has a disproportionately high number of minority students.  The only possible exception that I can think of would be large Asian populations at some schools, but arguments about whether they 'deserved' admission tend to fall a bit flat.  In other words, no one has a beef with a kid who is a national merit finalist and has a 4.0 (plus) no matter the kid's ethinic or racial background.   By contrast, there are school, especially private schools that have a disproportionately high non-minority population.  In fact, some schools, Bob Jones University comes to mind, receive federal funding while espousing view-points that discourage minority application (Bob Jones is against miscegenation (on Christian grounds no less)).  Bob Jones receives federal funding as do other schools that are unattractive to minority applicants (Oral Roberts, the Citadel and Brigham Young come to mind).  Look, give those schools money (hell, even give them my tax money), just don't cry foul when other schools answer the moral call to counter-act their efforts.   4.  Last, schools from states with larger minority populations (like Michigan), should be allowed latitude in developing student bodies that mirror (or come close to mirroring) their communities.  I hope few would find much to praise in a University of Virginia or a SUNY school that had very few minorities; I know few have a beef with the low number of minority students at the University of Utah.     Final Thoughts:   Still, what I would like to see instead of programs that work to insure admission to students based upon their ethnic or racial background are three things:  1.  An effort to make the overall admission process more fair at all Universities.  2.  Favor racial and ethnic groups only in cases where it is needed (don't award the 20 points to the hispanic kid from Auburn Hills whose parents are surgeons, who went to some fancy private school in Detroit, murdered the S.A.T., travelled abroad her sophomore year, and got an Infiniti for her sweet 16; instead, save the points for the minority kids who grew up less than priviliged and still finished school and  did well enough  to earn a Michigan degree.  Regardless of whether they did  as well as  some other kid who did not get in to Michigan, but will probably get in to Ohio State or the University of Illinois or Dana College in Blair, Nebraska.    3.  Let's have a conversation instead about the students each year who don't go to college (although they could) because they cannot afford to go (either because of money or circumstance).  Instead of efforts to deny admission to some (no-doubt) deserving students of color; why not efforts to promote admission for the deserving poor?  Sorry so lengthy,  Duf         "
"            News Update: Award Shows Still Suck  - or-  Why I Hate Dick Gere.   Okay, so I should know better, but I watched a good chunk of the Golden Globes last night anyway.  Yeah, The Two Towers gots pantsed left and right to sub-par movies like 'Gangs of New York' and 'Chicago', but I'm not bitter.  Well, maybe a little.  Admittedly, I'm not that big of a J.R.R. Tolkien nerd.  I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books except for the last one, which I anticipate will be enjoyed toward the end of the year...but even so, I am completely enthralled with what Peter Jackson's crew has accomplished since working on the films.  Yes, I'm a movie nerd and I've watched every little nugget of the extras on the 'Fellowship of the Ring: Extended Edition' (save for the commentaries) and I'm sorry, but if there was ever a director who deserved a 'Best Director' win, it's good ol' Kiwi Peter Jackson.  You won't find another director who was more involved with what was happening with not one but THREE gigantic films taking place at the same time.  But no...let's pucker up and kiss Marty Scorsese's ass a little more.  'Gangs of New York' was a big bloated stinksore of a movie that was decent for the first 20 minutes, and lost track of itself for the remaining 2 hours and 10 minutes.  F you, Marty.  But again, I'm not bitter.  I just turned off the Golden Globes after that.  Oh Jesus, but I wished I would've shut 'er off sooner.  Anyone see the contenders for best Dramatic Series on TV?  Yes, my Sopranos were nominated, but alas, they succumbed to 'The Shield', which judging from the clip they showed before giving the award away was probably the most horribly-acted, piss-poorest editing done...ever.  And they hand the award over.  It's gotta be political.  'The Sopranos' is single-handedly the best TV show on tv...period.  I may be biased.  Oh...and can someone tell me why people are so in love with Dick Gere?  Okay, he made a movie that a few women liked called 'Pretty Women' but he's no actor.  In EVERY single movie he's ever done, he plays the same gray-haired, rodent-eyed smarmy asshole he plays in EVERY other movie he's ever been.  Hey, Dick...why not stretch your horizons a bit?  Play a drooling retard, or someone that doesn't always get the girl, or better yet...play someone other than yourself you self-righteous twat.  I'm sorry, but about 10 minutes into his acceptance speech, I wanted to poke out my eardrums with a pencil.  Hey asshole, if we wanted to hear the end credits, we'd stick around after the movie was over.  Wow.  I need to calm down or take another day off or something...         "
"           F It...It's the Friday Five!   1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?    I like novels and admittedly, I read mostly fiction.  I tend to stay away from newspapers and magazines of substance because I like to stay pleasantly uninformed.  Turns out, I'm not missing much.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My favorite novel?  That's a tough one.  I guess I'll just list SOME of my favorite novels.  I really liked Stephen King's  'Misery.'   It was a bajillion times better than that pathetic movie they made with Kate Bates and Jim Caan.  The movie was Candyland in comparison.  (ooooh...big revelation, the book was better.)  I also like the book  'Filth'  by Irvine Welsh quite a bit.  Then again, I like just about everything that gadge writes.  This is a hard question to answer...it's kind of like asking me what my favorite movie is.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  It's too long to write, but it's  The Cremation of Sam McGee.   You can read it  urlLink here .  I've never been a big poetry buff, but the ones I really tend to like are ones with a story.  Call me a simpleton, but I'm a sucker for a clever tale...    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Either the Bible or Dianetics, though I probably never will.  I really want to see what all these religious kooks are making such a big fuss about.  Plus, I want to read about Scientology so I can make fun of it and not feel so guilty.   5. What are you currently reading?  Right now, I'm reading a children's novel by Cornelia Funke called  'The Thief Lord.'   It's pretty good.  Supposedly, she's like almost as popular as JK Rowling in other parts of the world.  I'll probably finish it this weekend and prepare myself for  'The Return of the King.'          "

His bunker was the refrigerator, mine was an office chair. 3) 'Can You Take It?'  A game of strength & stupidity: I sat there with my eyes closed, while Rob tried to throw paper wads at my face  as hard as he could . 4) Boobie trapping our office mates: We put a box of stuff (paper, highlighters, stuffed animal(?)) on the top of the door and called one of our coworkers to come over to our office.  This failed miserably since the door got stuck.  (Mental note: test boobie trap next time.) 5) We're going to the movie  Old School  now.    Have a good weekend.         "
"           Here's mine.  Sorry for the length, friends.  BTW - It's absolutely true. ------------------------------------------------------------   Wendy's Consumer Relations Wendy's International, Inc. 4288 W. Dublin-Granville Rd. Dublin, OH 43017  February 28, 2003  Dear Sir/Madam,  Ive always loved Wendys.  From their delicious, juicy hamburgers to their crisp and pleasantly salted French fries all the way down to the creamy and simply dreamy Frosty shakes.  Dave Thomas created a legendary burger shop where quality could be experienced visit after visit.  It was a real treat to enjoy my meals under Wendys roof.  That was, until last Saturday, February 22nd 2003.  My friend and I had the unfortunate pleasure of visiting your Woodbury, Minnesota location sometime around 8:30pm.  We entered the establishment hoping to fill our growling bellies full of deliciousness and stepped up to the counter.  Waiting behind the counter was a scowling young man by the name of Kahled.  As I approached the Can I help you zone, I received nothing of the sort.  Kahled merely glared at me as I smiled and got ready to place my order.  With nary a grunt, he punched in my meal:  - A number five with only ketchup, mustard, pickles, cheese and bacon. - A pack of 5 chicken tenders. - A delicious Mug root beer soft drink. - Regular fries (I decided not to Biggie Size it that night)  Kahled grumbled something that I couldnt understand.  When I asked him: Come again, friend?  He sighed and said rather loudly and abruptly: What do you want on it?  I repeated my request and he scornfully made the necessary corrections.  I felt like I was inconveniencing young Kahled.  As he went to collect the items that made up my order, he engaged himself in a quick kung-fu fight near the bubbling machine where the fries are made.  Another worker, complete in drive-thru gear, launched a kick toward Kahleds nether regions.  The kick was blocked, but with my to go bag in hand.  The paper was crushed and my eyes widened in horror.  This was the bag my food was going to go into?  With no sense of urgency, Kahled collected the rest of my order and dropped them into my mangled sack.  At the soft drink fountain, he began to pour my non-Biggie-sized beverage.  As you probably know, root beer tends to foam a bit more than other soft drinks.  He poured the delicious drink and stopped when the foam got to the top.  Instead of waiting for the bubbles to dissipate, he merely capped it and handed me my order.  He handed me my meal and said nothing.  Not even a Here you go or a Thank you.  He wore the same dejected look throughout the whole transaction.  Even during the kung-fu battle.   When I opened my soft drink, it was as I suspected.  The cup was 3/4s full.  Not the usual value Ive come to expect from Wendys.  My friend received similar treatment and we both decided on the ride home that we had just experienced Wendys at its worst: All because of a young miserable boy by the name of Kahled.  I do enjoy the food Ive received from Wendys in the past.  Im sure, in time, I may be able to forget the awful experience I endured at the hands of Kahled.  Ive always liked what Dave Thomas stood for, but I must say that Mr. Thomas would be absolutely appalled at the treatment we received at the Woodbury Wendys last Saturday night.  Please know that Im going to avoid this location for a long time to come.  I felt I should pass this incident on to you so that the integrity and Daves legacy would not be tainted by someone as awful as Kahled.  I am withholding my home address so that my home isnt attacked by Kahled and his kung-fu squad.  If youd like to reach me to discuss this further, I can be reached at my work number:  555-123-4567.  Fondly, DJ Shovelpants   ------------------------------------------------------------ I had to mail it, sadly.  I don't expect a prompt response.         "

"           Duf,  As you requested, I have written my one letter.  I wrote this to Kellogg's, praising their Special K Red Berries cereal.   Dear Sir/Madam:  You dont know how happy it makes me to see those freeze-dried strawberries every time I pour myself a bowl of Kelloggs Special K Red Berries.  I have always been a big fan of the traditional Special K  growing up, my grandma ate a bowl everyday while preaching your mantra to anyone who would listen: if you can pinch an inch  So with the addition of the Red Berries, not only am I keeping grandmas legacy alive, but Im also enjoying the sweetness the new Berries have to offer.  However, I do have 2 questions:  1) Why did you name the strawberries Red Berries?  Is there a trademark on the word Strawberry?  Do people ever complain because they were expecting RASPBERRIES in their cereal? (because those are red too) 2) Have you ever thought about selling the freeze-dried strawberries SEPARATE from the cereal?  I have to say, sometimes I just empty a box and dig around for the crunchy sweet goodness of the Red Berries.  They remind me of when I tried space food when I went to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago as a kidweird texture, but oddly delicious.  You could dominate an entirely new food category with this idea: Cereal Accompaniments.  If you sell them separately in their own bags, consumers could buy them to put on any kind of cereal they wish, not just Special K.  Please tell me if this is something you have already considered.  And again, thank you for a great breakfast experience.  Keep the Berries coming.   I will keep you posted on any reply I receive. I am already expecting a form letter, so maybe I'll be delightfully surprised.         "

"            Down with Biscomerica!   After waiting days for the response to my note to Biscomerica, I got a flat reply.  Here's my note (reprinted):   I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea. Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.   Here is my response from Trixie Fargo (no lie) at Biscomerica:   Thank you for taking the time to contact us!  We are delighted to hear that you enjoy our USA cookies.  The hat should be attached to Uncle Sam, as depicted on the front of the package.  Thank you!  Trixie Fargo   Trixie, you are wrong!  On the front of the package, there is a hat by itself.  Not only that, she completely left out JESUS!  Corporate America:  where's the passion?  I don't feel the passion.           "

"           HAL, someday I would like to hear the story about the blood all over your fridge.

Hey, as they say, you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your handsome prince.  But my cold-hearted snake exterior has been breaking down with this one...and it finally collapsed on Saturday when I was asked the question (this is the second time this has been asked, mind you): 'Can I call you my girlfriend?'  (Dorky, I know, but that's a huge reason I like the big galoot.)  'Yes, I guess that would be alright.'  When I told HAL this story, she told me she felt tears welling up.  Softy.

"           DJS, your Coldplay comments are awful reminiscent of the Whats the deal with Bono? post a few months back.  So Im just going to concede that everyone has their own tastes, and leave it at that.  Im crabby today.  As most of you know, I volunteer each month for 3 lousy hours.  For those who dont know, in this time, I help prepare a meal for the less fortunate, aka our friends in the alcoholic/schizophrenic homeless community.  About every 4 months or so, I take a turn and plan the meal.  Meaning, I figure out what to cook for dinner for about 125 men, go to the grocery store and purchase said food items on a budget of about $100 (I am reimbursed for the expense), and bring this meal to a place where I prepare it with about 5 other volunteers.  Its a pain to do, but as I said before, I only do it a few times each year.  So on Sunday I went to the Cub foods that I hate (the one in Edina) and picked up 20 boxes of pasta, 20 jars of meat sauce, several pounds of cheese, a few pounds of carrots (even drug addicts need their Vitamin D, yo) and a huge box of Oreos (drug addicts especially like the Oreos).  Granted, its not gourmet, but you try keeping things imaginative at less than $1/head.  I get the usual stares from people in the store  what?  A girl cant stock up???  pay up, and leave.  Shopping isnt the big headache in this process, folks.  Its the hauling.  As you can guess, the items above are heavy.  And Im one girl.  So after shopping, I load the items in my car.  And then I realize that 20 jars of pasta sauce will likely freeze in my trunk.  And the carrots and cheese probably wont do so hot, either.  So I leave the pasta in the trunk and haul everything else up to my apartment.  Bags are ripped, multiple trips made, but the job finally gets done.  The fridge is full, and Ive got a few bags of sauce to navigate, but its only for a day or two, so no big deal.  This is no worse than the time I had 30 pounds of ground beef bleed all over my refrigerator, but thats a story for another time.  Today I get an email from someone else in the group (who, for the record, I adore) saying she purchased the meal for tonight, so I write back and say, gee, thats great, but I already did that too.    Several of us back-and-forth-ed over what should we do?, and it looks like Im going to have to haul everything over there, and still end up hauling much of it back to be stored by yours truly for a month, at which time I can haul it over there again.  So Im irritated.          "
"           Okay...at the risk of being tarred and feathered, I just don't get the whole Coldplay thing.  Yeah, I think some of their songs are pretty good, but damn...you guys are passionate about them fellas.  (I'm sorry if I'm lumping Stoner with the rest of y'all...I'm not sure if she's a fan or not.)  Admittedly, I haven't heard either albums of theirs all the way through, but there hasn't been anything too significant (that I've heard) that just grabs me.  Sorry, friends.  Personally, I thought the Simon and Garfunkel thing felt awkward.  It's pretty obvious that Art hasn't been doing much these days and it kind of showed.  I don't know if it's because it's Madison Square Garden or what, but a lot of the performances were pretty flat.  They didn't seem like they wanted to be perfoming together...and for the record, I love me some Pauly Simon.    I thought the Nelly/Kelly Rowlands thing was almost unwatchable.  Mixing his two hits together didn't work well and it showed.  Afterwards, Nellyson had a look on his face that said  'Even this fake bandaid on my face isn't gonna save this one.'          "

"            The Definitive Grammy's, by Duf'   Top three moments at the Grammy's (in order from cool to coolest):  3.  Simon and Garfunkel opening the show with the 'Sounds of Silence.'  2.  Eminem singing 'You Only Get One Shot' backed by the Roots (they were goin' off in the background).  1.  Der:  Coldplay singing 'Politik' backed by the New York Philharmonic.  Best Grammy moment ever.  I could just feel them saying:  'this war is a bad idea.' I always love passion and sincerity , and they had both.  I was pulling my hair out and screaming for June to hurry on up so I can go see them (drinkie winkie poo) in Chicago with Panda and the fella (assuming he is still on the scene - or is that cynical?)    I loved the Clash tribute, DJS, but I would rank it fourth.  My favorite thing about the Grammy's is it really distinguishes between artists.  Avril Levigne exposed herself as a flash in the pan (or to quote Robin Williams (holding the grammy to his ear) 'I can actually hear careers ending!').  No Doubt continues to refuse to die even though  there's really not a lot up there.     The Dixie Chicks are talented musicians, no denying that, but man were they flat.  Ladies, ease up on the Valium.  Nelly was surprisingly flat (could it be the production?).  John Mayer seemed poised for a 16 year old, and the classically trained woman who sang before him and has some pop song I have heard a dozen times but don't know was quite good too.  I always love Yo Yo Ma, even when he is playing with bald wife-beaters.  Norah is solid, and I was happy to see her get the praise she got, but the Grammy's has a tendency to overdo it year after year.  It is a great disc, and she is a great singer, but I don't know if ALL THAT PRAISE was merited (Similarly, as much as I loved the 'O Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack last year, I think it was over-awarded.  I'm Norah, I don't want to start my career with my debut album winning 5600 Grammy awards.  Talk about setting yourself up for a sophomore slump... (not to jinx her).  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get drunk and go shopping (for burritos that is).           "
"           DJS, unfortunately I fell asleep before I could catch the Clash tribute...and I did not fall asleep because I thought the Grammy's were boring, but it had been a rough weekend for me.  You didn't tape it by chance??  Tremendous Avril Lacrap haikus, by the way.  Did any of you see MTV's pre-Grammy show?  What was her problem there...she was acting like she had never been out in public before.  Angst?  More like social-moron-asshead-half-wit.         "
"           The Grammy's SUCK.  Sorry, friends.  I'm an awards-show junkie, but the Grammy's just don't do it for me.  Plus, they were on during 'Alias', so I saw very little.  Duf told me that while Coldplay won a few 'gongs' (as they call them in the UK), those categories weren't included in the telecast, so they were not allowed to speak.  That's all I needed to seal my contempt of that show.          "
"           I'm going to have to disagree with you a bit, Panda.  While Coldplay's performance was one of the better of the evening, I think the best part of the Grammy's was when Sil, Dave Grohl, The Boss & Elvis Costello did their Clash tribute for 'London Calling.'  I don't know, I got the warm fuzzies seeing all of those guys playing together, plus the dude from No Doubt was back there laying some chunky bass riffs down.  I thought ol' Chris was going to knock himself out, head-banging whilst tickling the ivories.  For the record, this is the first Grammy's that I actually watched more than 65% of.  Could it be because of Norah Jones???  Mayhap...         "
"           How 'bout those  urlLink Grammy's ?  Ms. Jones cleaned up, but Coldplay's performance was the most memorable, IMHO.  Chris Martin can wail on that piano.  HAL, I will continue to stand in line behind you to bear his children.         "
"            Fun things to do when you're drunk:   1) Uuuuhhzzzssh. 2) Eat burritos. 3) Dance. 4) Sing karaoke. 5) Client conference calls. 6) Go shopping.  I experienced #6 on Saturday afternoon, and never could have imagined how fun it could be.  Me and the fella were having a nice, lazy Saturday - went to a museum, walking around Michigan Ave...when we stumbled across the Mexican restaurant 'Su Casa' and decided to have some lunchie and drinkie.  After 2 large margaritas (it doesn't take much), I was ready to shop until I literally dropped.  First I dragged fella to Ann Taylor and wanted to try on several dresses.  When they asked me if I wanted him to come into the dressing area with me I screamed 'Absolutely NOT!'  I was confused because I thought she was suggesting he go  in my dressing room with me  (not that I'm  that  modest, but I thought it was weird), but what she meant was that he sit in this sitting area they have for the men.  The dresses weren't exactly working out, and when the sales lady knocked on my door, without even thinking, I opened it - and didn't have my shirt on.  I think the men were happy to be shopping with their wives that day, because they got a nice show from me.  Fella just laughed his ass off...'When you did that, I was just under the impression that women's dressing rooms were, you know, very  free ...'  No, that's just me being a drunk asshole.  On to Bloomingdale's to try on more dresses...  I insisted on going to the designer section ( so unlike me  considering TJ Maxx is more up my alley)...and then proceeded to 1) Open a Bloomingdale's charge card, and 2) Buy $400 worth of stuff.  When I was at the Clinique counter, I wanted to buy my mom some eye cream for her birthday, so I asked the lady what was the difference between all the varieties they had.  'Well, this one softens lines, and this one reduces puffiness, and this one...'  'Um,  whatever .  I'll take the cheapest one.' (FYI - Clinique ladies don't like it when you're a smart ass.)  Of course, we continued the evening at my favorite local bar (no HAL, not the Hangge Uppe): Monsignor Murphy's.  And their shot of the month: the delicious Oatmeal Cookie.  It couldn't have been a more perfect day.  But on Sunday I was wondering what I was doing with all this crap from Bloomingdale's.  Thank God for flexible return policies.          "

"            PB can be emotional, y'all.   I know some may describe me as crass, blunt, bitchy, tough...maybe even a little crazy.  But believe it or not, I'm probably the biggest sap you'll ever meet, although I may not show it right away.  And it could not have been more evident than it was today: I met Billygoat for lunch, on his way to the airport for his 2-1/2 month trip to Central America.  This morning I gathered the rest of his crap he left at my place, all of the mail that he still has coming to my house, and I was fully prepared just to give him his shit and tell him to take a hike.  But I couldn't...when I saw him, I just started to cry.  It's not that I'm not over him, because believe me, I am.  But the thought of saying good bye to anyone - boyfriend or not - to possibly never see him again, is a very sad prospect.  So I sat in this Thai restaurant, had a very cathartic cry (first time I cried since we officially called off the wedding), and said  goodbye . That's it.  My office mate summed up why this happened: 'Its very easy to be unhappy with someone you dont see.  So true, my friends.   Now, where the hell is my beer??           "

"            1. What is your most prized material possession?  I have a copy of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran that my mother gave to my father (may he rest in peace) when they were dating.  I would say if I had to grab one THING in the event of a fire, that would be it.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  This is a bizarre thing about me, but I really dont have a lot of my old stuff.  Much of it is still stored at dear old moms, and much of that has been thrown away.  So, I would say that thing I own that I have had the longest is The Prophet.    3. Are you a packrat?  In a way.  I have a hard time discarding magazines.  I have too many CDs and books, but other than that, it all must go.  Although, like Panda, I likes my photos too.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I really like a clean house.  But, like most men, I really hate what you have to do to have one.  When I lived alone, my space was always spotless.  We have a maid now (don't hate) and that helps, but our house is too small for the stuff we have, so clutter is an issue.  When we have adequate storage space, we will be much better off.     5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Themes:  'Damn dees people po.'  'Please God paint me.'  And:  'Hand it on down, we'll take it!'          "
"            1. What is your most prized material possession?  Oh, how can one decide?  I likey my framed autographed picture and CD of Bjork that I fought for tooth, nail and credit card to get on Ebay.  I also have an autographed picture of Alec Guiness in Obi Wan gear that I'm quite fond of.  Hmmm...I like my truck too, though I guess it's not actually mine.  Not for another 4 years, anyway.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I guess it's the pajamas I got when I was born.  I fired out of my mom, they spanked me, wiped me off and stuffed me in these awful little pajamas that are like blue terrycloth and are as comfortable as sandpaper.  A couple of years ago, my mom gave them to me.  Guess she didn't need 'em anymore.   3. Are you a packrat?  You have no idea.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I prefer a little clutter...okay, a generous amount of clutter.  This, however, doesn't agree with my beloved, so we try and reach a happy medium.  It took a long time for her to get used to not reshelving a book I was reading if I set it down for longer than 5 minutes.  I've gotten much better and so has she, God bless her...   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Kind of.  The downstairs shitter is the designated: Have a seat and enjoy yourself theme.  There's a framed photo of a picture I took in Chicago of a laundromat sign with the words DROP YOUR PANTS HERE, positioned above the toilet.  While you're seated, there is a cluster of goofy random black and white pictures that have been framed and arranged tastefully, including: a framed greeting card of a little boy reaching into his pants with a smile on his face, a picture of Sil (Steve VanZandt) of the Sopranos looking disgusted, an old sign that says MADAMS, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GIRLS OFF THE STREETS AFTER DARK, and some other nuggets.  I don't know how I got away with decorating that bathroom, but it's actually one of our favorite rooms.  It's got character, baby.          "
"             1. What is your most prized material possession?  A Jedi not possessions prize.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I agree with Panda, gotta be something from baby-hood.  To be specific, maybe its Lamby, my stuffed Lamb.  This just illustrates my lack of creativity, even as a child - I get a stuffed lamb and name it Lamby?!!??!     3. Are you a packrat?  Yes, a bit.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  Im tidy but not too clean.  I dislike dusting, vacuuming, etc.  But I pick up after myself.  I just realized that its kinda weird how vacuum has 2 us.   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Yes.  The theme is affordable.          "
"            A Vast Improvement from Last Week    1. What is your most prized material possession?  Does a  collection  of things count?  If so, then my answer would be my huge collection of photos.  I have to say I usually have my camera with me during some of the funniest/greatest times of my life (HAL and Stoner can attest to that).  When thinking about this question, I thought about what I would cry hardest about if I ever lost it...I would  cry my eyes out  if my pictures were ever taken away.  I briefly considered my signed copy (by the entire band) of The Bends by Radiohead, but I thought I'd only whimper a little bit if that was ever gone.     2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I'm sure my mom has a scrap of a blanket or something of mine when I was a baby, but the thing I remember  touching  me the most was a little gold ring my dad gave me when I was about 4 or 5 with my birthstone (emerald) in it.  I wore it so much it got a little bent, but I loved that ring.  It's still in my jewelry box.   3. Are you a packrat?  With letters, pictures, and CDs - yes.  But I got the 'throw away' syndrome from my mom.  If I didn't throw things away like I do, I'd be swimming in crap since my apartment is so small.  I try to keep things simple - I'm a minimalist at heart.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  Spic-and-span, definitely.  Jillios used to make fun of me, saying I would prefer to live in a hospital.  If I could, I would clear my house of all junk...only clean surfaces.  Just a room (hardwood floors) with a chair, lamp, and a table.   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  I only have one room (studio apartments are a bitch).  Everything has its place, even the knick-knacks, but there is no real 'theme'.  I can't wait to move into a larger space so I can finally decorate, but the truth is, not having room saves you a lot of money.             "

"           Stoner - that's so spontaneous - I LOVE IT!  The only reason I would want to go on a cruise is because I could have access to a buffet 24-7.  Not that I would actually  eat  24-7, but just knowing the food is there would bring me great happiness.  Jan scares me.   My lack of filters came out again today.  Thong was showing us a picture of this girl in TCW magazine (TCW stands for 'Today's Chicago Woman' - one of those free publications that shows you pictures of the so-called 'swanky' crowd at their snob parties hanging out with so-called 'celebrities' that happen to be in town...it's right up Thong's alley...the life she yearns for.)  Well, she told us that one of her friends told her she looked 'just like' one of the girls on the '51 Singles You Should Know' list.  This is just about the gayest 'article' ever - they ask these chachi's what their 'Turn-ons' are or, please, tell us about your 'Sense of Style'.  Barf.  There were actually 2 pictures of the girl Thong supposedly looked like.  In one of them she looked fairly normal, but a little bloated, and the other one was kind of a glamour-shot type pose.  Thong made the mistake of asking me which one she looked more like.  My response (pointing at the glamour-shot pose): 'You definitely look more like her.  She wears too much make-up.'  Um, did I just say that?           "

"           Stoner Gone Wild...  I am in a very deep state of shock. Excitement. And shock.   My honey got bored at work the other day and started checking out travel deals. He found a very, very good deal for a cruise and somehow managed to talk me into it. My tax return is much bigger than I had expected, so technically I can afford it, but I had planned to be financially responsible with it - and going to the Bahamas is something I've always wanted to do, but didn't expect to be doing this weekend.

Asked me if I'd like some of her leftover Metamucil.  2.  Asked DJ LZ how good my aim is...(toilet aim, friends)  3.  Mentioned to more than a few folks here that her and her husband are 'naked people' as in they don't wear clothes much.  4.  Can't stand not knowing other people's business.

"            The Morbidly Obese Doth Offend from Time to Time   DJS, Hal and I work with this woman named 'Jan.' 'Jan' is morbidly obese and she is our 'Reception Specialist' (nope, I did not make that up).  Anyway, Jan figures prominently in the story I am about to tell.   Last week, we hired a gentleman by the name of HB.  HB is an African American.  He is in his late forties, has a moustache, three grown children, one grandchild and moved to the Twin Citays in 1975 to start working in the title business (for the record I was 7 in '75).  He is shorter than me by 6 inches or so, balding and well dressed (unlike the loveable Duf).  He is soft spoken and wears a ring on his right hand.  He cannot type 75 wpm.  He lives in Minneapolis (I live in 'The Paul' or 'Shots Paul,' by the way).  He is a title expert and I had to use spell check to get 'title' right.  He can not rock the mike.  He cannot bust a move (see photo, above:  nuff said about Duf).  He is not a vegetarian, a unitarian or uber-liberal.  He went to a private university and not the best land grant University in the world.  He drives an American car and talks to his parents more than once a month.  He has had a colonoscopy.  He has never had a one night stand with buxom twins, nor has he won an award for BMX trick riding.   Anyway, I was walking down the hall with HB, and on my way back to my desk Jan says to me, she says:  'You two are a lot a like.'  That, my friends is superficial thinking at its shallowest.  In reply I simply said:  'Whereas you, 'Jan,' are unique in the world.'         "
"           I just entered Minneapolis as a potential spot for Dave Attell to do an 'Insomniac' show.  In 50 words or less, I had to try and sell this place.

"           Stoner,   What is a PTO day?  Thanks in advance,  Duf         "
"            Apologies for not replying sooner...   I didn't go to work yesterday. Apparently I missed a good Pandyland day. Duf, I really liked your message to the cookie people.  As far as calendars go, I have a 'play with your food' one that is hilarious. It was a gift from 80 degrees (I believe we're supposed to refer to our friends via code names, and that is hers) and it also came with stickers, which I love. This month a strawberry is kissing some puckered-up piece of green produce (possibly ugli fruit?). I use the adorable fruit/veggie stickers to mark PTO days, and rubber ducky stickers (also a gift from 80 degrees) to mark the days I work out. Next month I am switching to shamrocks and leprechauns, and the month after I am switching to easter eggs and baby chicks. I need the motivation to get me to the gym.  I also have a perpetual postcard calendar, which was a gift from Hal. I love this calendar, but it does put a little pressure on my because it is displayed in a place where people walking by can see it, and if I don't change the date right away in the morning (every day!) I hear about it. People actually use it as their source for date information - which I don't recommend, because I cannot be counted on to change it every day.  I also used to have a Wells Fargo calendar in my cube, but I gave it to my honey because his calendar at home expired at the end of last year (imagine that). And our 'trinkets and trash' vendor gave us all ceramic coasters with 2003 calendars on them, but I threw mine away because I thought it was tacky. It didn't fit with my desk's decor (most of the items, including my little green lamp which was a gift from Panda, came from my trip to Ikea with Hal and Panda several years ago). Finally, I have a little Kandinky calendar that was also a gift from Hal, but I cut off the calendar parts and just hung up the pictures.   My computer, office phone, cell phone and both of my watches also tell me the date. I track most of my appointments in Outlook though, but have a Clinique day-timer (given to my by my coworker, who got it as a free gift with her purchase and was going to throw it away) that I use for easy and portable reference.  And now, like Duf, I must go wash my hands.         "

Maybe they should be the official Bad Cookie of Pandyland.  We should distribute them to drunk people at the PBJ2.  Or should we call it the PB&BJ??         "
"           We just ate the Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies.  They are made by Biscomerica, and they suck.  I actually have an aftertaste that is still killing me even minutes later.  Anyway, I wrote the company via their web site.  I lied in my message.  This is what I wrote:  I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea.  Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.    I will share the reply...stay tuned.         "

"           I only have a boring office-type calendar in my cube.  It's very functional, but not fun at all.  The guy who sits next to me has a Far Side calendar, and sometimes he lets me read the funny ones, so that's cool.  I don't think Stoner has a calendar in her cube, otherwise she would know it's been FAR TOO LONG since we've had a substantial post from her.    Where's the love?          "
"           Yeah, I've got Uncle Junior (from the Sopranos) staring over my shoulder all day.  He looks pissed off and grumpy and actually I feel a little intimidated knowing he's back there looking at me.         "

"           DJS, stick to making jokes - you're pretty funny.  Duf, admit it, you're happier.  You've found the better path.  I have a U2 calendar here at the job (save your gasps of shock), and February is Adam month.  Thankfully they gave him the shortest month.  I wasn't bothered by it before, because this is the first week of the month that I've been in my cube.  But now that I'm on day 3 of staring at the bass man, I'm sick of it.  Thank goodness March is Edge month (I had to preview).  Speaking of work calendars, DJS is a Soprano.  I have a Missy Elliot song in my head.         "
"           Hey...I thought my newest haiku was light-hearted enough.  Ironically, we were discussing this on the way back from lunch and I basically said the same thing.  I'd hate to incur HAL's wrath.         "

"            Hal has turned me into a freak!   Okay, I have a mildly obsessive complusive side, I admit that.  I even worry a little bit that it will get worse and worse as I get older and older until I am washing and washing my hands fifty times a day and re-alphabetizing and re-alphabetizing my CD over and over.    Anyway, Hal used to give me a hard time because I had a tendency to accumulate e-mails in my MS mail Inbox.  Sometimes I would have like 2200 items in my Inbox with 900 or so unread (let me explain here that I have preview so I can see the first few lines of e-mail messages without opening them.  So if I can glean the essence of the message without opening it, then I do/did).  Anyway, I finally swept my box clean, and now I am a freak about zeroing it out all the time.  It's unhealthy.  I live in fear that I will return to the dark days of multiple messages stacking up and stacking up and stacking up...until, finally, I am living in a house full of magazines and newspapers and spent fast food bags and junk mail and bulk food purchases from Sams Club so that finally I have to cut pathways just to get from room to room and the only thing in the house that is not dirty is the clean-ass sink where I wash my hands over and over and over until they are chapped and bleed justifying the medication I so clearly need (only to take it obsessively - twice a day, ten and ten, but after food, so I will have some bread before each one, but then I must toast it, but only slightly and no butter or margarine unless it's Friday).  Okay, gotta go arrange my sock drawer.         "

On Valentine's Day, when the fella was making me dinner, I decided I'd warm up the dessert I brought over - a delicious, homemade apple crisp - in the oven.  Unfortunately for my arm, but fortunately for fella's entertainment, I attempted this after drinking an entire bottle of wine by myself.  (I had to do  something  while I was waiting for him to cook me tuna steak and pumpkin soup.)    Because I had hit a nice drunken stupor, I did not feel the hot, metal, oven rack scald my wrist.  I, too, have a nice mark to remember this by.  But I do not remember the pain.  I do remember laughing a lot, though.            "

"            A Short Commentary on Thongs: Pros & Cons   Pros:  1) Thongs are great if it's Saturday night and you feel like wearing that kicky pair of tight black pants and you want to avoid the dreaded 'underwear line'. (HAL, there's no way you're getting me to use the P-word.) 2) Guys love them...they just do.  Wear one, and certain guys may just buy you a car...or at least a bus pass.  Cons: 1) They are so fricking uncomfortable.  I don't care what certain girls say...'You just have to get used to them, and then you'll never even feel them!'  You people are liars, because I think I would no longer be human if I suddenly became 'comfortable' with something lodged up my butt crack.  But Dirty may disagree - refer to his latest post. 2) Some girls always have them sticking out of their pants.  (Celebrity sightings: Britney and Christina) Two words, DJS: low class.  My coworker, Thong, has her's practically up to the middle of her back...what the hell is that?  Can she not feel it?  Once I actually commented: 'Um, Thong, your underwear is sticking WAY out...'  (I've never been accused of having filters, you know.)  Her response?  'Oh, my red ones!  You like them?'  Are you kidding?  No, dumbass, I wasn't  complimenting  them, I was telling you you're a white trash whore.    How can I make this any clearer?           "

"            1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.    Because somehow I think people want to read about the things I buy, people that piss me off, and movies that I hate/love.  Uh...people do want to hear that stuff, right?  Right?  Actually, my previous blog Soft Drink needed to be shut down because it caused a couple sets of moist eyes.  I miss my old blog, but love my guest-starring role here on Pandyland.  Yo, word is bond.    2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  A couple of 'em, I guess.  My asshole friend Dirty likes to read the whole site entry by entry then cite how boring we are.  He secretly wishes he was the 5th Pandylanda...  Sorry, Dirty.  No room.  I haven't subjected anyone else to our blog because of the ruckus I caused with Soft Drink.  Mayhap I'm a little blog-shy in getting others to read it.  Garsh...wouldn't want to upset any other big-nosed, alcoholic assholes.   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?    Sure.    4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??    I'm actually adapting all of our entries into a screenplay.  I'm going to pitch it in Tinseltown later this year.  The hardest part was trying to keep all of Panda's exploits down to a PG-13 rating.  Not an easy job, yo.  And I'm really trying to make HAL's character a bit more punchy.  Duf's motivation is somewhat questionable, too.  I've had early script-reviewers tell me he doesn't make a convincing protagonist.  I think the lovey-dovey feeling that Stoner's smitten character-in-love provides acts as a great balance to Panda's crazy Chicago-night escapades.  I'm not sure where I fit into all of this, but I'm hoping to write a car chase in for myself.  Hopefully I'll be able to have my character fire an Uzi out the window.  I've always wanted to do that.    5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.     I don't really have any favorites.  But here's a couple.   1.   urlLink Care For Something Dirty?   - My friend Abbot's alter-ego goes off the deep end from time to time to the delight of us all.  (Except Stoner)  2.     urlLink Goobita  - This girl is totally self-centered and a bit of an airhead, but I'm drawn to it like a fly to shit.  Okay...I admit it.  I think she's cute.  Not much else there, though.  3.   urlLink DNord  - The birth of my nickname was built by leaving jerky comments on his personal journal.  I used to work with this guy, and he figured out who I am, but that still didn't scare me away.  He acts like he knows more than he really does.  Totally boring, totally uninformed.  Again...I visit regularly.  4.   urlLink How I Got Published...(or tried anyway)  - A shameless plug for my blog/journal about my struggles to get my sorry ass published.  Not a very riveting read, but I've had some famous authors send me e-mails from reading some of my posts.  I use my REAL nickname on here, BTW.  5.   urlLink Moonshine's Live Journal  - Want to feel better about your life?  Read this Live Journal of an unemployed mother of two living in Minneapolis who has just about the worst luck of anyone I've ever come across.  A lot of posts about her daily life, but like a car wreck I'm strangely compelled to tune in and see what happens.  Nice person, but man...the fu%#ed up situations she finds herself in...  By the way.  This Friday 5?  Worst ever...         "
"             I agree - today's Friday 5 is kind of a joke.     1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  I'm a frayed knot!   2.

Orange you glad I didn't say banana?   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?  To get to the other side.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs?   Kermit's finger!         "
"             The Friday 5 better improve     1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  Peer pressure.   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  I have a t-shirt with our URL written across the front.  I wear it everywhere, I think its helping get the word out.  Either that, or folks are just staring at my chest without going to the site.  That better not be the case.   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  Yes.  Were egomaniacs who think that our thoughts and activities are of interest to others.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  North-northwest.  Hopefully well make it to Alaska by August.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?  I dont read any other blogs  as touched on in #3, Im pretty self-absorbed.          "
"            Tellin it like it is: The Friday Five    1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  1) I get incredibly bored at work. 2) It's a good idea to keep in touch with the Twin Cities crew.  It's the only way HAL will continue to send me presents.  3) To meet new and interesting people: Duf & DJS - who woulda thunk I could love ya so darn much?!?     2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  Most of the people I tell about it look at me funny or forget the address, so they never read it anyway.  My parents definitely don't know...mom would be sorely disappointed in her angelic daughter.  I would never again tell anyone I'm dating about it...how could I give y'all the dish otherwise?   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  1) Bono 24-7-365; 2) Time to get our drink on.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  I definitely think we should continue to add embarrassing photos of our members...I'll be sure to bring my camera to Minneapolis in March.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?  I only have 3: I found  urlLink this one  randomly, but it has some interesting perspectives.  Hate Wal-Mart? (Or your job/coworkers in general?) Then you'll love  urlLink this .

Why is it that a shared love of a particular band/artist can always draw people together?  Or maybe it's just me.          "
"           DJS, I thought your Dukes of Hazard/Peanuts reference was very poetic.    Speaking of family that lives in excessive proximity my mother comes from a very large family - she was lucky # 13 of the 13 kids my grandparents had.  Her family spent their summers at a house on a lake.  Somewhere between then and now her siblings all found a way to really, really not like each other (I dont like to say hate).  Not to the tune of death threats, but definitely to the tune of lawsuits and other similarly bad behavior.  To illustrate  a few months ago I was asked (in writing) whether or not I would like to sue one of my cousins.  The letter was from one of my uncles (via his attorney), and the entire episode was absolutely non-surprising to me.  I actually took it as a welcome to the family-type gesture.   Alright, so back to this lake in western Minnesota where my mother grew up  I swear that  the houses on this lake belong to either one of my mothers siblings, or one of their children (or one of my mothers cousins, or one of their children).  I go back there and I am continually amazed that all these people who dont like each other choose to live on top of each other  at a second home, no less!  I mean, its a nice spot and all, but there are 10,000 lakes in this great state  why not venture out and make a few new enemies?  And to get into the reason that still visit said lake gets into truly Dynasty/Peyton Place territory.  Besides, you get the point.  So Im all for a little distance with family.  On an entirely different note, I saw  urlLink this movie  this weekend with Stoner.  It was very feel-good, and chock full of girl-power.  I highly recommend it if you like any of those things.  Or if you like soccer.   Sorry, Duf, I have yet to see  urlLink this , but I hope to soon...  Happy Monday, Pandyz.          "

"           Having spent the past weekend in a small town, I can safely say this: I enjoy the scenery of a small town, but there's no way in Christ Jesus's name our Lord, amen will I ever live in one.  DJ LZ's sister and bro-in-law moved to a small, small town south of the cities where he's planning on opening a landscaping business.  They got the opportunity to buy his uncle's house and live there for cheaper.  Newer house...big, out in the country.  Oh, but there's a catch or two:   1.  Grandma lives on the property too.  Her house, and I'm not shitting you, is 50 yards away.  If you're bumpin' uglies and the windows are open, ol' granny is going to see all of the action.   Not only does Gramma live close-by, their next closest neighbors are the bro-in-law's parents!  Further down?  Yep, you guessed it...another uncle.  Hey I love my family as much as the next guy, but there's no way I'm living in their goddamn backyard.   2.  Dirt driveway.  It's a regular Dukes of Hazzard thing going on.  I guess concrete is too darn expensive, so they'll just pull the General Lee up and hop out through the windows.  Like DJ LZ, her sister is a bit of a neat freak.  Good luck with that...everytime someone pulls up to the house, it's going to look like Pig Pen from the Peanuts Gang bumrushed the place.   3.  Local bar: The Town Pump.  I'm not kidding.  We popped in for a beer and there were signs hung strategically near the doors that read: 'Anyone fighting will be ejected for 30 days.'  That's nice.  Since there aren't a whole lot of people who can frequent the place, they can't really kick anyone out for good.  It's kind of like a penalty box for country hicks.         "

"           Direct quote from Thong after she got back from the bathroom:  'Whoo-wee!  Thank God, the oatmeal finally kicked in!'  That's perfect.  Exactly what I needed to hear on a Friday afternoon.  I'm leaving shortly to take a quick roadtrip to 'Sconie.  (DJS, I know how much you like that term.)  A little Tori, Old Style, and re-living the college days on State Street.    As you can see, I'm not that complex.         "
"           I think I have a lot of complexities, but I dont think that there are two types of people in this world.  Therefore, none of us are either/or.  If you need to label me, Im complex.  But heres my rundown on Dufs list:  1.  I am low maintenance.  For those of you that scoff at this, go on a camping trip (or another comparable activity) with me and then tell me your answer.  2.  I am not a genius.  3.  I dont need a lot for fulfillment.  I have no 5 year (or 1 year, or 25 year) plan.  If you asked me what my goals are in life, I would struggle to answer - not because I dont know what I want, but just because I really dont want much.  I cannot recall any time in my life where I have felt 'unfulfilled', 'empty', or anything of the like.  4.  Im left brain (though not extreme left brain).  5.  I rarely if ever see more in words/actions then speaker intends.  In English class when they would say that the red scarf represented life or hunger, I never saw that.  I wouldnt even remember the red scarf.  Same thing about foreshadowing, I was like, huh?  Its the same reaction I would have after watching Dawsons Creek and someone would say, I think Joey and Pacey are going to get together because of what he said at the hot dog stand, and I would be say oh yeah, I really liked the shoes that Joey was wearing in that scene!  6.  I highly enjoy subtlety and nuance (so heres is one of my complex features).  When the red scarf was discussed, I was always like, ahhhhh. thats pretty cool.  But then I would wonder if the poor author just happened to mention the color of the scarf with no motive, and now its being dissected in English classes for all eternity (again, making me complex).  When Joey and Pacey got together, I really liked seeing the repeats to see the (now obvious to me) hints that they were a far better couple than Joey and Dawson.  7.  I absolutely believe that all people are good (making me not complex).  But I also believe that everyone has good and bad in them (making me complex).  8.  I have idiosyncrasies and pet peeves.  But not more than the next gal.  9.  Ive had my nicks, but Im not high on the trauma scale.  That said, some of my complexities definitely arise from specific points (even moments) in my life, as do all of us.  10. I dont have a lot of passions, but those that I do have, Im very passionate about. (dunno if this makes me c or nc)  11. I accept people as they are.  I dont think that there is any right way to go about life.  I also believe very strongly that you cannot change another person (and thats a good thing).  12. I like to rotate between the island vacation and the city vacation, but I do lean towards the city vacation.  Something with historical significance is preferred.  Or involving a kick-ass concert.  13. There are no absolutes in life.  Except death and taxes, of course.          "

"           Shouldn't over-analyzing your own nuances while trying to determine whether or not you're complex automatically make you complex?         "
"            The Friday One  By Duf Fer  I have one question for you.   Are you complex or not complex?   Here are some things to think about while answering.  1.Erase any pejorative connotations of complex. Being complex or not complex is neither good nor bad, it just is.  2.No one factor is, in and of itself, determinative unless is EXTREME.  3.Complex is different from high maintenance, but if you are really high maintenance, that may suggest something about whether you are complex.  4.Intelligence is, in most instances, not a factor.  However, there is a level of genius that per se qualifies someone as complex (see, e.g. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Vincent Van Gogh).  Similarly, there is a point at which low intelligence would qualify someone as not complex.  For most people, intelligence is non-determinative.  5.Probably the factor that drives your status more than anything else is how much is required in order for you to be fulfilled.  If a lot is required, then you tend toward complex.  If not much is required, then you are not complex.    6.Are you right brain (creative) dominant or left brain (analytical) dominant?  Being right brain dominant increases the likelihood that you are complex.  Being left brain dominant, increases the likelihood that you are not complex.  7.Do you tend to see more in words and actions than the speaker or actor intends?  If so, then there is an increased chance that you are complex.    8.Do you like subtlety and nuance?  If so, then you tend toward complex.  If you prefer and respond better to the direct, then you tend toward being not complex.    9.Which of these statements do you most agree with?  People are basically good (not complex).  People are basically good, but their systems and devices elevate pathos within the group making those systems and devices inherently corrupt and therefore evil (tending toward complex).  People are basically evil (complex).  10.Do you have a lot of idiosyncrasies and pet peeves?  If so, then you tend toward complex.  11.If you have a history of issues or trauma and those issues or that trauma defines you more than it should, then you tend toward complex.    12.If you have a lot of passions, hobbies, pursuitsif you are a renaissance person, then you tend toward the complex.   13.If you tend to accept people as they are and take a happy go lucky approach to life, then you tend toward not complex.    14.If you had to choose one vacation over another (all things being equal  in other words, you are not vacationing to reduce stress or mourn a loss, you are just taking a vacation), which would you choose?  I would choose an island vacation with lots of r and r (not complex). I would choose an urban vacation with much to offer by way of sight-seeing and activities (complex).  15.Last, if you think most of lifes moral and ethical questions can be met with a right or wrong/good or bad answer, then you tend toward complex.    For a perfect example of complex and not complex, see the film Personal Velocity and focus on the second story featuring Parker Posey (complex) and her husband (not complex).  Okay, so, I talked to Hal and DJS about this yesterday, and they are probably  well sick  of it.  Last night, I told my mother-in-law that she was complex but her children and husband were not complex.  She did not hit me by the way.  I asked my wife if I am complex or not complex, and she did not hesitate to say I was not complex (based on factors 5 and 13, BTW).  After thinking about it, I would agree with her and say that  I am not complex , but just barely.          "
"            Bitch Session   Normally, when I'm finally back home in Chicago, I'm in a great mood.  Not today.  In addition to DJS overriding my post (no hard feelings, friend...I just thought I'd tease you), I've had my head slammed into the ground a few times today. (not literally)   1)  Another ass-backwards view from my company: it's more effective and cost-efficient for me to travel to NY and spend thousands of dollars a month to get trained, than for someone within our NY office to learn how to use our web teaching tool. This takes approximately 5 minutes to learn...I know because I've used it before with our clients.  I just don't get it.  Here's the direct quote I got from the head of L&D:  'I just spoke with the trainer and she has no experience with Webex. Since the trainer is inexperienced and the room is not set up, we won't be able to accommodate Panda virtually. Please let me know if you have any questions. We're sorry it didn't work out.'  Yeah, I have a question.  Why is your intellectual equivalent a box of rocks?   2)  I don't understand why boys need to keep explaining themselves and asking 'why?' when you've already told them 'I'll call you if I change my mind.'  One word: pathetic.  At least I have a date tonight...and we're going to my favorite place on earth - Medieval Times.  Horses, jousting, and bad food should get me out of this funk.  If not, then I guess we'll  have to resort to a Cuban restaurant.         "
"            What is your first childhood memory?  I remember my mother coming into my room to wake me up, opening my drapes (its very bright outside) and telling me Youre going to have your picture taken today.  Then we go to the JcPenneys portrait gallery and a middle-aged man with a mustache (it was the 70s, folks) and brown hair is taking my picture, taking care to pose my arm on the fake branch/log prop thing.  I was 3.  When I look at those pictures today, I have a dj vu feeling.  I wonder what happened to that photographer...   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? Discuss.   I have a story to go with every purse, pair of shoes, and coat that I own.  And I might just lay down in traffic for a few of those items.  But I have little attachment to my actual clothing (i.e. jeans, sweaters, t-shirts and the like).   Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)   Theyre all sexual in nature, so Ill just say that I dont pay my rent in cash and leave it at that.  Don't judge me.          "
"            First memory:  When I was four, my family went to California. At the beach, a plane flew over. My older brother told me it was the plane I was supposed to take  he said they were all going home on a different one, and I was going to have to stay in California by myself forever.   Favorite clothing:  I have a wide variety of favorites  one in each genre, whether its sweaters, jeans, t-shirts, long-sleeved t-shirts, underwear, etc. Im pretty much always wearing one of my favorites  today, Im wearing my favorite socks.    Morning ritual:  As a general rule, I drive to work in a high-stress, emergency manner every morning. If I am driving from my honeys residence, I even put on makeup in my car. Dangerous, I know  but it saves 10 minutes and I only do it at stoplights. From my residence, I drive on the shoulder and cut ahead of traffic. Again, its dangerous. I know. And even with all of this high-speed driving and other risky business, I am still typically 15 minutes late for work.           "
"            What is your first childhood memory?   I remember being in a small green house, sitting in a high chair next to my twin bro in a high chair waiting for toast.  I have no clue how old I was.   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? Discuss.   I have a green sweatshirt with an embroidered golfer on it that my ex-girlfriend's parents gave me.  It is comfortable and it reminds me of golf.  I also have this pair of tiger printed thong underwear that I like a lot:  grrrrrrrrrrrrr (hear me roar)!   Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)   I pretend to sleep while I peek at Mrs. Duf in the buf while she is getting dressed for work.  I read (usually poetry) in the bathroom.

"            DJS: The Thursday Three    What is your first childhood memory?  My first childhood memory (no doubt aided by the super 8 films my parents took at the time) was me peering in at my baby brother Dr. Rob PHD in his crib.  I was just a little over two and I was extremely fascinated by the little bastard.  I would just watch him sleep in his crib and poke him from time to time if I wanted to see him do something.  I didn't go through the 'I'm jealous of the baby' phase.  No sir.  I just wanted him to grow up so that we could play with cars and Legos and such.   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?  Discuss.  Yes I do.  I've got this old gray fleece sweatshirt that I wear all of the time.  It's a J. Crew (don't hate, it was my first) and I don't think I'll ever find a more functional piece of clothing ever.  It's great for when it's cold and I just need something to throw on real quick in the winters.  Spring and fall I use it for my famous cargo shorts/sweatshirt ensembles, but in summer I gotta put it away.  It's like a ritual.  Me to sweatshirt:  I'll see you in two months, friend.    Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)  I don't know if this is considered a ritual, or even sexual, but I do it anyway.  Since DJ LZ gets up a good 45 minutes before me, she showers first.  Even though I'm dead tired and not ready to wake up, I try to sneak a peek at her from under the covers while she's getting dressed.  I do this every morning.  A little nudity in the morning is just the thing to make me feel refreshed and ready to face the day.  My ritual, of course, is ruined if she decides to get dressed in our walk-in closet while she's picking out what to wear.  What can I say?  I don't tire of seeing her in the buff.    Note: That's a good thing.         "
"            Two Olives for a Great American   My favorite Senator of all time (yes, even more than Wellstone and even more than Lyndon Johnson), Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, died yesterday.  He was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man who could not be defined by party affiliations (he was a central figure in the Kennedy administration  and  in the Nixon administration for crying out loud).  He wrote 18 books and cared passionately about issues of race, ethnicity and class.  I bet that Panda and I both would find much to admire in his policies (now that's crossover).    When I was an intern in Washington (pause for Monica Lewinsky joke), there were a handful of people that I always wanted to see.  I was there during the Bush administration (pause for second Monica Lewinsky joke) and there were all these famous politicians that I always got a charge out of seeing.  Ted Kennedy was one.  John Kerry was another.  Lowell Weicker, the great Connecticut maverick, was still another (should I have been born in the Northeast?).  The President, of course.  There were others, but none topped Senator Moynihan.  I would sometimes go to finance committee meetings to hear him speak.  I even visited the Senate floor a couple of times to catch his remarks on some piece of legislation or another.  He was the kind of Senator I would want to be if I were one:  an intellectual, independent, a man of ideas and history, a supremely witty wordsmith quick with a bon mot, but perhaps most of all, a man you would want to knock back drinks with.  DPM was a martini drinker, so today, knock one back in his honor.  Make mine with two olives, please.         "

"            DJS  - bring it you Oprah-hating so and so!         "
"           Sorry, friends.  I have little to say about Oprah.  I think she is neither Jesus nor the devil.  I also have no personal anecdotes regarding her.  However, I do have something else to share.  I try to keep my news sources somewhat diverse, and in surfing various online news outlets, I always like to check out the 'most emailed' stories to see what people are interested in/interested in sharing.  On ABC's news site, apparently people are not too worked up about the conflict in the middle east.  Based on the fact that it's the #1 emailed story on that site, they are more worried about  urlLink cooties .  But who isn't?         "
"            On a Side Note: Don't Forget Stedman   Stedman Graham has been Oprah's 'steady' for years now.  He's a community leader but will never get the kind of credit Oprah gets because he's not on TV (although you'd think sleeping with her would give him  a bit more  press...).  And he's generally a pretty nice guy.  I saw him once on one of my flights to NY.  I recognized him (since I live in Chicago, I probably see him more in the news than others might).  No one else even noticed the poor sap.  He was sitting in COACH -  behind  little old me!  Finally, one of the stewardesses realized who he was and quickly led him up to First Class.  Now, I usually think the people in First Class are major snobs (I've only been there twice - I hoard my upgrades), but you'd think a guy who has his hands on Oprah's loot would have said something.  But he didn't...and he looked  really  embarrassed to be 'escorted' up there.    I think any guy that can stand in the type of shadows a woman like Oprah casts deserves mucho credit and accolades.  The only 'friend of a friend' stories I have about Oprah are: 1) My coworker Thong works out at the same health club Oprah belongs to.  She says she sees her there from time to time and without her make-up she looks AWFUL.  Thong claims she never went up to her for an autograph, but I was once out with Thong in NY when we ran into Queen Latifah at a steak joint.  Not only did she go up to the Queen herself (while buzzed, no less), but she also said whats happenin sistah?  I thought Id die of embarrassment.  So maybe I cant trust Thong. 2) A former coworker of mine once saw her walking her dogs off of Michigan Ave...again, no make-up.  Absolutely hideous.          "
"            Duf  - I'll fight you.         "
"            My Oprah Experience by Duf Fer   Once, I was in Chicago visiting a friend.  The friend is rich. His parents have a really boss pad in a fashionable building on the Gold Coast.  They are part owners of the Chicago White Sox. They have plenty of cash.  As I was walking into the building, I came out of the revolving doors and bumped into, literally, Oprah.    I would pay money to see the look on my face.  My immediate reaction was to say excuse me.  I bumped into someone.  My just as immediate second reaction was to realize who I bumped.  Just as immediately as that, I exclaimed 'oh my God!'  She laughed and said 'no problem' and gave me what I would call a genuine smile.  I have seen her show maybe 5 times in my life.  It seems to be classy and thoughtful, even as it is slick and, perhaps, insincere.    Two things in reply, DJS.  First, I have a friend whose mom was shopping at a posh grocery store in Connecticut and happened to see a very famous man.  We will call him PN.  She went up to him and said 'I'm a big fan' or 'Can I have an autograph?' or some such thing that fans say.  PN said 'get the fuck away from me': hostile words in a hostile tone.  I can only imagine that I am one of thousands of people who have heard about it either directly or indirectly.  So, PN had a really bad moment.  PN is probably a flaming asshole.  But, there are times when it makes me wonder about the burdens of celebrity.  Myself, I would not want to rich, powerful or famous.  But, if I had to avoid one, without a doubt, I would avoid fame.  What a curse. Oprah has all three.  Second, I'm not sure I blame Oprah for her popularity.  She is the consummate Capitalist, no doubt about it.  She is all about the dollar that's clear.  We used to debate the merits and demerits of her book club at Barnes and Noble all the time.  I think, in general, we all concluded that she got people to buy good books and read them (two good things).  I can say with certainty that she was surprised by the popularity of her book club.  I don't know that it is her fault though.  I also think that, as you get to know Jonathan Franzen (and 'The Corrections' is phenomenal BTW) you will realize that in the jerk Olympics, he would easily lap Oprah, and then flip off the crowd as he accepted his gold medal.    But I have to admit I am an Oprah apologist.  I like powerful women in general (I even admire Martha Stewart though I have never seen her show or read her magazine, and even though I am troubled by the insider trading scandal when I was in high school, I had a Geraldine Ferraro thing that woud not quit - I can admit that among friends, right?), and I tend to root for the success of AfAms in general.  Having said that, I know there is probably much about her that is worthy of criticism.  I just wanted to say that there is much about her that is worthy of praise too.  Last, I have a friend who has a friend who worked for Oprah for years. The friend told my friend (who told me) that Oprah is very hard to work for (very demanding, very particular, a perfectionist and often uncivil), but also very generous and supportive, and, in a strange way, one to cultivate a (dysfunctional, yes) family atmosphere at Harpo productions.

"            Why I Hate Oprah by DJ Shovelpants   Yes, America loves them some Oprah.  Me?  I think she's the biggest phony this side of my left ass cheek.  The following are some things about the self-important ego-maniac that drive me to drink.   Oprah is a nice person.   Absolutely false.  She treats everyone as though they are peasants and is about as nice as having a rousing case of apocalyptic stomach cancer.  My father, who is now a retired police captain had to organize security for Dirty ol' Winfrey when she was in town some years back.  Since he was one of the top dogs, he had to escort her in her limo to the site of her appearance and he said that he'd never seen anything like her.  She was nothing but rude to the people who worked for her and had a nasty snarl on her face during the entire 'backstage' experience.  Only when she was out on stage and talking to her league of followers did she bother to smile.  My dad said it was like jekyl and hyde.  'One minute she was acting like a total 'c___' (a phrase he never uses, btw) and the next, she's acting like she's on the same level with the people that paid money to see her,' father DJ reported.  'Plus,' he added.  'She's got a head like a goddamn medicine ball.  Huge.'   But Oprah gives gifts to her viewers!   Yeah, and so does Santa Claus.  Look, any half-wit can see the game that's running during her 'I Want To Pamper My Guests' shows.  You think ol' fatty wallet Winfrey is actually shelling out dough to give 'thousands of dollars worth of items' away...just out of the kindness of her heart?  Think again!  All of this stuff that she's giving away is donated from the companies.  It's called 'plugging.'  When you think you're watching Oprah really 'giving something back' take a closer look.  You're watching an Oprah informercial!  Yeah, it's great to get deluxe apricot face scrub and a bath robe woven from the hair of 3 year olds, but don't think for a second that you're seeing Oprah's generosity first hand.  The people providing the 'gifts' are lining her swollen pockets with more money.  Why?  Because her followers think that if Oprah likes something...it's gotta be good.  Which brings me to...   Oprah's Got a Book Club!   Don't even get me started on this.  There's just something sinister about Oprah 'reading' a book and then turning around to tell her followers to read it and...guess what?  It's a huge bestseller.  No one person should have this kind of influence over a large mass of people.  The only other person I can think of that was able to brainwash people was a German fellow...named HITLER!  Okay, so I exaggerate, but the plain truth is: yes, some of the books that are part of her club are good.  Admittedly there are even some that I plan to read...but I think Jonathan Franzen did the right thing when he told Oprah to go ahead and leave him out of the book club.  Good for him!  I wouldn't want her stupid logo emblazoned on my book (if I ever get published) either.  Thanks but no thanks, Oprah.  I'll let the work speak for itself.  Way to go, Johnny.   But She's So Down To Earth...   Yeah, sure...and Charleton Heston isn't a gun-toting drooling idiot.  It bothers me to no end that she's got a magazine (sorry, Stoner).  Why?  I'm guessing she has very little to do with it other than use her 'mind-altering power and name' to sell copies and to show up every month to have her picture on the cover.  Yuck!  To me, the magazine is merely another vehicle for her 'brainwashed fans' to pick up and scour the pages so that they can find out what their television girlfriend thinks they should buy or how they should dress or whatever.  Sweet Jesus!  Think for yourself, people.  And the whole thing with her phony face being on the cover of every issue...yeah, I don't detect any inflated ego there.  Nope...none at all.   But, but...  I realize she does some good.  Yes, she donates lots of money to charities and all that stuff.  That's fine.  She's gotten people who haven't picked up a book since high school to read her 'selections.'  Great.  But she's also unleashed that tyrant Dr. Phil on the rest of us.  Well, guess what?  I don't buy half of the stuff this asshole spouts on about and I don't like the look of his potato head.  I don't think you'll see armies of men following Dr. Philbert's every word and buying the Dr. Phil magazine if (and god forbid) it should ever come out.  I know a lot of Oprah's fan feel a sense of 'belonging' to her club or group of fans, but trust me when I say this: the bottom line is the dollar dollar dollar bill y'all.  She's not your friend.  Oprah wouldn't touch you to scratch you...unless it's going to increase her ratings or line her XXL pockets with cold hard cash.              "
"            While We're On Oprah...   I know DJS is an unapologetic Oprah hater, but I kind of like her.  She is well-dressed, articulate and rich!  Also, her show, when considered next to Jennie Jones and Maury and bald-ass Montel and Jerry (a consummate entertainer), is nothing but class.  Now, that Dr. Phil...I'm no fan of his!  I'll southern accent you!         "
"            All I have to say is...   I'd better get my Oprah Magazine soon, or there is going to be HELL TO PAY! I'm serious. I've been checking the mailbox for weeks, and still haven't gotten it.  As far as the 2sday 2 goes, I second Hal's emotions. Top Gun all the way, purely because of Iceman. And Mystic Pizza, well, because I had a crush on the guy that Kat kisses (even if she is the babysitter and he is the dad).          "

Other faves include Rain Man (takes me back to New Years Day 2000, aka The Day Stoner Almost Died) and Jerry McGuire (though it has caused far too much personal pain amongst several of my friends), I also thought he was great in Magnolia  one of the few times hes shown us his sense of humor.  Id also like to make note of his work in A Few Good Men  a great example of the mysterious seductive powers of a cocky sonovabitch (I am normally immune to Tom Cruise - I like men taller than 5'2').    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie? Why?  Mystic Pizza.  HANDS DOWN (I know what you are!!  A hustler!!, Its the shit, Steam, dont eat it).  And I agree with Panda, Lili Taylor is great in it.  And what I wouldnt give for that soundtrack!  Second place goes to Pretty Woman  a far guiltier pleasure than MP, but were all friends here (This aint a buffet, Kit!).         "
"             What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?   That's a tough one.  I haven't seen many Tommy Cruise movies that I haven't liked.  I'm with Duf on this one.  He's vastly under-appreciated and he really knows how to pick roles.  I did get pissed at him for a while for choosing similiar roles/vehicles.  'Days of Thunder' was 'Top Gun' on wheels down to the put-on-the-brakes-so-we-can-get-the-upper-hand move.  But if I were to pick just one, I'd have to go with 'Cocktail.'  Yes it was cheesy.  Yes it was just a plain ol' dumb movie, but it reminds me of my days as an Usher at Apache 6 theatres.  I had it timed so I could 'check' the theatre during the waterfall scene.  Elizabeth Shue.  Delish!  Plus, who can resist the killer soundtrack (Kokomo, Don't Worry Be Happy) and how they flip all those bottles around?     Close favorites:  Born on the Fourth of July, MI:2, Jerry McGuire    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?   Oh...you mean 'Horse-Faced Julia Roberts?'  Easy.  'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' which was a horseshit film.  Why is it my favorite?  Because she gets killed in the movie.  Sorry if I ruined it, but I've actually saved you some time and money.  Seriously.  Spend your money on something else.  You can thank me later.         "
"            It's Tuesday    What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie? Why?   My fave is probably  The Outsiders , although more because I like the book than the film.  Plus, Tommy was so cute and young - his face was so smooth & shiny! (I'm not saying I like young boys, but...)  A close second is  Far and Away .  I'm a sucker for a good romantic film, sans comedy. Tom and Nic sizzle.   What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie? Why?   Mystic Pizza  - one of Hal's guilty pleasures, but my favorite Julia movie.  She made this movie before she thought she was God's gift, and that innocence and humbleness comes through in her character.  I also have a fascination with Lili Taylor.         "

What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?  Although I really liked 'Rainman' and 'Mission Impossible 2' and especially 'Eyes Wide Shut,' my favorite Tom Cruise movie (drum roll please) is 'The Color of Money' hands down.  By the way, I think Tom Cruise is simultaneously overrated and under-appreciated.  I really liked the movie.  I thought he did a great job, and Paul Newman was at the height of his powers (the much maligned Marty Scorsese was brilliant).    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?  Ocean's Eleven surprised me.  I thought it was pretty darn good, actually.  I also would give props to 'Everyone Says I Love You' and 'Pret-a-Porter.'  But, without a doubt, the best movie Julia Roberts has been in (hands down, nothing else even comes close) is 'The Player.'  Not only is it my second favorite Altman movie, but it is one of my all-time favorites.  It's almost cheating to pick her here because she is barely in it, but... you know the rules!          "
"            Lullaby in Birdland   With  Lullaby in Birdland  being one of my favorite tunes sung by some of the greats: the jazz vocal group Manhattan Transfer, Mel Torme, Ella Fitzgerald...  I always wondered what and where Birdland was exactly.  My question was answered  urlLink last night .  I took my parents there to have dinner and see a great 16-piece jazz orchestra: The Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra with Lew Tabackin.  Toshiko (the quirkiest Japanese lady EVER) and Lew (a very quiet, introspective man with a white, white beard and killer jazz chops) are married.   And man, can they make music together.  If you're ever in the Big Apple, Birdland is not to be missed. As Charlie Parker once put it - 'The Jazz Corner of the World.'    Out of sight!           "

I didn't really over-do it last night, it's more that I mixed things up.  A lesson you think I would've learned when I was 16 - if you're drinking beer, just stick to it.  Don't play the hero and down a mixed drink and then some cider and then back to beer.  The drinking definitely intensified when U2 lost (*sniff, sniff*) their oscar to the flash-in-the-pan Eminem.

"            Explosion Avoidance/My Longest Rant Ever (PB, don't kick me out)   Sometimes, I feel like I will explode if I don't write something.  Today, what's stuck in my craw is  urlLink this.   Here's why:  1.   'Put an end  to the spoiled, disrespectful, ungrateful pro-peacers who don't know the meaning of sacrifice.'  How should we put an end to them?  Oh, I have an idea: we can use all the electric chairs and gas chambers that are under-utilized in America (that's sarcasm BTW).  Just so I'm clear, is this man really suggesting that we kill Americans who don't 'support the troops'?  2.  There is a sign that says France Sucks.  I could write a book on what bugs me about that, but I will try to be brief.  First, the government of France does not support this war.  The French people are divided on it (like the people of all nations of the world).  The country of France (its people) is different from the government of France.  That's why we are targeting this war at the government of Iraq and not at the country of Iraq and certainly not at the Iraqi people.  It is possible to oppose the government but not the whole country.  What is the value of all this hatred of France?  Second, France was acting on what it believed.  They have an obligation to do so, just as we do.  Third, I'm not sure France is wrong.  It is difficult to argue that diplomatic measures were exhausted before the bombing began.  U.N. Resolution 1441 clearly does not authorize this action and requires a second resolution to sanction the use of force.  The inability of the U.S. to secure U.N. Security Council approval for this effort is not the fault of France (recognize that we have the responsibility for making a case for war - and we failed to do it; recognize further that France was not the only country that planned to veto the Security Council Resolution - should we hate Russia too?  Should we hate everyone who disagrees with us?  Should I hate the man who hates people who love peace?  Where does all this hate leave us?  What would Jesus do?).    3.  I don't even know what to write about the Freedom chainsaw.  I really don't.  I have thought about it all morning, and I still don't have any coherent thought in response.  People trouble me is about all I can come up with.  Here's the thing:  1.  I support our troops.  I also feel really sorry for them.   2.  I suspect our fighting men and women know that this war is not entirely on the up and up.  Troops during Operation Desert Storm talked about 'why they were there' all the time.  They were open in their speculation about whether the war was about oil.  Troops in Vietnam were candid about the impropriety of American involvement there.  Our soldiers know more than most Americans that it is almost impossible to make a case that Saddam should be removed while allowing other regimes to remain in power (see my fourth point below).   3.  Questioning the war does not mean failing to support our troops (perhaps this is so basic and so easy that it escapes people's minds).  It is possible to hate the war and love the soldier.  In many ways, love of soldier compels us to question and challenge war.  4.  The men and women fighting in Iraq are  not  protecting  our  freedom.  While one may argue that Iraq is a threat to the U.S.  Only strained reasoning would allow that argument to hold any water.  First, Iraq has no weaponry capable of reaching the United States.  Their missile range is not only capped at a few hundred miles, but also so grossly inaccurate that the missiles, even if they could fly the several thousand miles to the U.S., would be more likely to hit Baghdad than Boston.  Second, let's be honest, Iraq's main threat is to Israel.  Our men and women are more involved to protect Israel than the U.S.  Third, Iraq's minimal weaponry is significantly less threatening to the U.S. than the nuclear weapons possessed by countries like Pakistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea (recently awakened by sloppy foreign policy), Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  If we are really interested in  protecting our freedom  by eliminating possession of weapons of mass destruction by unstable regimes, then what the hell are we doing in Iraq?  If we were to rank direct threats to the security of the U.S., I'm not even sure Iraq would make the top twenty (even if you factor in terrorism - the C.I.A. all but admitted that there is no connection between Iraq and Al Queda).     5.  I will bet anyone $100 that our troops come back with some kind of syndrome or another.  (Let history be your teacher here:  there are the effects of Agent Orange exposure to our Vietnam era veterans (finally admitted after a few decades of U.S. government denial); and there is the currently denied Gulf War Syndrome).  I will add to the bet that Iraqi war veterans will be under-supported by the government, that they will find little financial assistance for necessary medical care and that they will be directed to woefully over-crowded and horribly under-funded VA hospitals.  I bet that, to the extent that their effects include mental instability and violent behavior, they will meet with little or no understanding from our criminal justice system.  Last, I bet that many of the folks who attended weekend rallies in support of our troops will either:  a) remain silent when soldiers return and need our support; b) vote for tax cuts that further undermine the ability of agencies charged with supporting veterans to actually provided meaningful support; or c) both.     6.  The essence of democracy is freedom.  One of the freedoms we are supposed to value as citizens in a democracy (I'll save my arguments on why we are not a democracy for later) is the freedom of speech (this is so basic that the inability to understand it shocks and frightens me).  The freedom of speech defends and supports the right of the citizenry to express their opinion. It is not limited to voices that support the government (and perhaps has most value in dissent).  We have a long line of famous dissenters in the United States.  Abraham Lincoln was a prominent in his opposition to the Spanish-American war.  Richard Nixon campaigned on getting our troops out of Vietnam  even while soldiers were there fighting .  If we take away dissent, we are not free.   7.  The illogic of claiming to support troops who are fighting for our freedom and seeking to silence those who exercise freedom in dissent is so visceral and so removed from reason that it depresses me.    How can something so basic be so little understood?          "

"            Friday5 Is Still Alive (check back next week, yo)    1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?    This question is always so hard for me.  There are so many different reasons to meet people.  For golf, I would pick Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Meg Mallon.  Philosophically, I would want to meet Jesus, Martin Luther or Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Politically, I would love to meet Jimmy Carter, Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson or Saddam Hussein (I would at least TRY to reason with the man).  Artistically, I would want to meet Glenn Gould, Jimmy Hendrix, John Updike, Richard Ford or the poets A.R. Ammons and Galway Kinnell.   For dinner, I would want to meet Gertrude Stein, Big Ernie Hemingway (pig on a spit?), Malcolm X and Bill Clinton.  Romantically, I would want to meet Audrey Hepburn (circa 1960), Amanda Plummer (dont ask) Anjelica Huston, Ariana Huffington, Halle Berry, Parker Posey, Bjork, Condolezza Rice or Faye Dunaway (circa 1960).   But, with only one choice, the person I would most like to meet would be Krzystzof Kieslowski the Polish film director.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?    This may be lame or boring (how could it be more boring than my last answer, I know, I know, but wait), but, as an AfAm, I definitely would not go backwards.  I also feel that, overall, we get worse globally with each passing year.  I am a bit of a Luddite and I think technology makes us worse, not better.  So, I would pick the present century.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?   I would move to Scandinavia or Canada.  I am politically more in line with folks there, and I think that in terms of quality of life, they are on par with or better than America (unless you count culture and food).  But I would hate to move.  I am proud to be an American, and I feel really lucky to be born here instead of many other places.     4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?    Easy, Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?   Tyson, the Ralph Lauren model.          "
"             A Little Better...The Friday 5 Presented in DJS Stereo     1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  I'd like to meet my great great grandpa, the guy who is the reason I have the middle name I've got.  He looked like a interesting old guy who wore bib overalls, had a dog named Tippy and spent hours and hours whittling pieces of wood into chains and fans and other useless items.  I've got an old newspaper article that he was featured in and he didn't even bother to look up at the camera, he's just sitting in his old chair, Tippy at his feet, working his pocket knife into the wood.  Before the big battle my family endured at the hands of my e-vil grandma, my parents secured me a relic from my great grandpa's past.  It's an old wind-up watch some girlfriend gave him back in the olden days.  So cool.  The amazing thing is, it still works.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Future.  Definitely future.  I'd be too afraid to go into the past a la Marty McFly and wreck too much shit in the present.   Plus, I'm all about technology.  I want to ride in cars that'll fold up into my suitcase, and had a robot maid picking up after me.  Plus, not having to cook when you want a delicious meal?  Sign me up for that.   3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  It would be home.  I'm tired of being at work.   4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  Indiana Jones...no wait, Darth Vader, no...scratch that...I'd want to be Gollum.  Er, on second thought...how about Oprah?  That way I'd throw myself off of a bridge and do the world a favor.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  Probably George Clooney's.  I was going to say Sloth from 'The Goonies' but I figured that would get old real quick.         "

Sometimes I'm at home and I need to feel even more at home (you know?) and that does the trick. I don't have a ton of guilty pleasures (I express my love for Justin Timberlake and Oprah Magazine with pride) but the other day I took a bubble bath and THEN went to the gym, which felt like a guilty pleasure because I took the bath knowing full well that I intended to sweat and then shower again later on.

"            PB's Thursday 3    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  When I was 17 and a senior in high school, I went through about a month-long phase where I wanted to join the Marines.  I went on and on about this...I remember vividly.  I was enamored with the uniforms, the challenge, the extreme toughness, the yelling, the fact that most Marines are sick-in-the-head.  When my brother caught wind of my plans, he laughed his ass off, especially because at the time I was about 90 pounds and nowhere close to as tough as I am now.  (I'll kick your ass if you disagree.)  He then challenged me to do 50 push-ups in a row.  I could not do it.  So I changed my mind.    But, to answer the question, I still dream about being a Marine, so that's the branch I would choose now.   What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  I'm with Duf on the donut thing: I love getting 2 Boston Cremes from Dunkin' Donuts (Double Down with the Double D, Hal.).  Especially because I love hearing the Indian guy with his THICK Indian accent say 'Yes maam, 2 Boston Cremes.' And I like classic, just out of the fryer Krispy Kremes.  I also adore Mac & Cheese.  My guilty pleasure is to read the latest copy of US magazine on my plane rides to and from NYC.  Sometimes I hide it in a copy of Business 2.0 or Smithsonian (sounds like pervy Saddam) just because I am always on business flights and am afraid my fellow passengers will think I'm an airhead.  I can't get enough of the celebrity gossip.  I need serious help.   The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.

If I was knee deep in the shit, like in 'Nam or something, I would need for it to be dry dirt.  I can't walk around in mud.  It makes me have to pee.  In Saigon, I would be a killing machine.  In the jungle, surrounded by mud, I would be worthless ('hold on a second guys, I have to pee pee').  Once, up in the boundary waters, I was portaging with a canoe on my back, and sank past my knee in slippery, slippery mud.  I was so unhappy.  So very, very unhappy.

The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny.  Discuss.  I disagree.  I'm totally against it when it is not discrete.  The problem with the thong movement is that folks seem to have this need to flaunt the thong.  Folks that wear a thong with low cut jeans and a bare midriff so you can see the thong?  They are  so  wrong.  That should be illegal.  If people wear a thong and it's not known that they are wearing a thong, I think that's wonderful.

"            Clean to Very Clean  By Gunnery Sargeant First Class Duf Fer  We probably should not go public with this (for national security reasons), but since we have a very small readership and code names and all, we should be fine.    Okay, here goes.  DJS and I are special ops operatives for a national agency (unnamed for national security reasons).  If you notice that our number of posts goes down, it's because we are in the 'shit' over in the Middle East killing 'the madman of Baghdad' or taking out select members of Iraq's Republican Guard.    For example, earlier today, we got word that Saddam (correct pronounciation rhymes with 'Madam' or 'Adam') was at the Best Buy in Bloomington.  When we got there, it turns out it he was at the Bruegger's Bagel Bakery.  So we went there, and they said he was at the Borders Bookstore.  We found him in the magazine section trying to hide behind a copy of 'Juggs' that he stuffed inside the 'Harvard Business Review' so that we would not know he was a smutter.  Anyway, it turns out this perv was just some Saddam look-a-like.  But, to be safe, we exterminated the target with extreme prejudice using our typical surgical precision:  it was a clean to very clean hit.

If your vehicle is unable to fit in a standard parking space, please don't drive it.  Better yet, just never buy a vehicle if it has to take up two spaces in the lot.  Thanks.         "
"            It's Gotta Be the Shoes   I saw Panda this weekend (she looked great as always and she was sporting a new tatoo - owwwwwwww!).  Anywho, I thought she was taller, but she wasn't.  Pandylandaz...make some noise!         "
"            1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    Call me crazy, but I wouldn't want to be famous.  Rich wouldn't be too bad, but famous?  Nah.  Now, before you scream at me and say it's just hypothetical, and just for one day, I'll play along and say I'd be J.LO so that I could be the soon-to-be Mrs. Affleck for a day.  But I wouldn't want to be in public, or have to sing any of my crappy songs or be in any of my crappy videos, or act in my crappy movies, anything like that.  If Benny breaks up with Jenny before my chance to be her for a day, no thanks.  If not J.LO, I wouldn't mind being First Lady for a day, because, let's face it, that's a pretty sweet job.  But I don't see myself married to Dubya.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?

"            1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    This totally just popped into my head, but it makes perfect sense:  J. Lo .  Here's why: 1. I could finally have gorgeous, dark, glowing skin...even if just for one day. 2. I could spend gobbs of money on ridiculous things. 3. I could drive a Bentley. 4. I could diss P. Diddy...big time. 5. I could kiss Benny Affleck all day long. 6. It would be a-ok for me to have a protruding boo-tay...and I'd shake it.  7. I could make a music video with L.L. Cool J.  I would tell him the one-pant-leg-up look is O-U-T.  8. I could speak fluent Spanish. 9. I'd be keeping it real, since I  am  from the Block, yo.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    Anything by a generic crap band that's on a top forty station.  Some examples: Lifehouse, Vertical Horizon, Sister Hazel, Third Eye Blind, Matchbox 20, etc, etc.  These bands are so damn forgettable, and their music all sounds the same.  Blah!          "

"            Tuesday Two, y'all, Tuesday Two, y'all.  Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday Two y'all!    1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    That's easy.  I would be Tiger Woods.  My hope that one day would be long enough for me to pick up some things from his golf swing and groove them into my muscle memory.  I could also know what it feels like to hit a ball 300+ yards and have people stare at me adoringly.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    For me it's a four-way tie:  Anything by Meatloaf (although he is rarely on the radio anymore), anything by the Violent Femmes (please die 'Blister in the Sun', please - it was great the first million times I heard it, and now I absolutely cannot stand it at all, not even a little bit and don't get me started on 'Do you like American Music?'  Arrrggghhh!).  That one song by the Suburbs that they play here too much...(when will it die?)...and that is similar to this one other song I destest by the Meat Puppets ('Johnny loves Janie, Janie love Paul womp, womp, womp, womp....).  It's horrible.  Horrible.  I'm upset just thinking about it.  Ick.  Meatloaf fans, let me feel ya'.         "
"            The Tuesday 2! Presented by DJS    1.    If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be?  Why?   I think I'd want to see what a day in the life of J.K. Rowling would be like.  Since she's the most popular author in the world, it might be somewhat interesting to see what she does in one day.  That way, I can feel better (or worse) about myself for not even getting published yet, let alone being a sliver as successful as she is with her kids books.  Maybe it'll put things into perspective, you know?  Well...probably not.   2.    What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?   That's easy: Dave Matthews Band.  The lamest, shit, frat-rock music ever.  If you like listening to DMB...then I'm sorry, I can't be your friend anymore.         "

"           Sorry for the lack of posts lately.  I can explain...   1.  We're having a bagel bowling bonanza tournament here in the office today.  Since I invented the game, I'm more or less running things.  Speaking of which, the finals are in a few minutes...  If you haven't done this in your office, you should.  It's a friggin' blast.   2.  I got Photoshop 7.  As evidenced by my appearance at the Hindenburg explosion, I've been spending a lot of time learning how to make it work.  Yeah, I'm not a full-on computer nerd yet...give it time.   3.  Nothing really exciting has been going on.  Really.  Once spring has hit us full on, maybe there will be some interesting stuff to blog about, but not much is new under the sun.   4.  I've been busy putting up the valence in the kitchen.  If you're ever in Woodbury and would like to see it (the valence, I mean) let me know.  It's beautiful.   5.   Friday Five?  No time.         "
"           Call me lazy, but I would prefer a Friday 2. I know that's not alliterative, but five questions is just too much commitment.   How 'bout we do a Tuesday Two and then a Thursday Three? That would be more manageable, and we'd have all five questions done a whole day early!  Of course, we would have to write our own - but they wouldn't be half as lame, I'm sure.         "
"            1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?   I would kill a good, kind and gentle man if it cut my phone time in half.     2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?   The Star Tribune called me; they want me to up my service.  I said 'how did you get my work number?' then hung up.  Was that rude?   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?   Two cordless; two cell. (Don't hate).   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?   I used to work for a U.S.S. who is a great guy and is now a Washington player.  When he was done talking, he would just hang up.  No hate intended, but rude city baby.  I said nothing to him about it (hello, I was an intern), but others worked on him a great deal.   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?   I would rather e-mail.  Although, sometimes the phone call cannot be replaced - people don't always understand your mood and meaning in writing.  The Friday Five is about to get kicked to the kurb.  We may have to make our own if they don't shape up really quick like.         "
"            I love the good old U.S. of A., but Not More than Booze and Snacks   During lunch, DJS and I had salad with lots of freedom dressing (it is the best, the tangy flavor the artificial orange color).  Anyway, we had an argument over whether it is wrong to freedom kiss on the second date (he said no - but he's kind of slutty).  I said yes...no freedom kissing until the third of fourth date.  Later, we discussed the merits of the freedom cut bikini.    Okay, that was sarcastic.  All I am saying is this:  without french fries and vodka, my life is dimished significantly.  So, if France and Russia veto U.N. Resolution 1441 and the patriotic thing to do is ban all things Russian or French, then I'm going to be one brie eatin', fry snackin', vodka drinkin', unpatriotic so and so.         "
"            Are you ready for the WEEKEND?  How about this lame-o Friday Five.   BTW, there are no rules this weekend except ONE: What goes on in the Twin Cities  stays  in the Twin Cities.  That's all I'm sayin'.   1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?  I like talking on the phone if I have juicy gossip or to plan an event for the weekend.  I usually don't call people just to chat.  Bor-ing.   2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  Kellie - we're excited to get the hell out of dodge and head to God's Country.   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?  One cordless, one cell.  Whatever.   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?  I absolutely hate people with call-waiting.  When someone says 'Hey, can I get this other call?' that basically means 'You're not important enough for me to talk to'.  I don't ever use the call waiting I have on my cell phone, and I don't have it on my cordless at home.  If someone really needs to get a hold of me and he/she hears a busy signal or gets my voice-mail, the person can call back or leave a message.  C'mon people!   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the situation.  If I'm dumping a guy, I try to call and let him off easy - it's the least I can do.  But Kellie likes to e-mail guys her 'Dear John' letters...she's a bitch like that.           "

"            Why I hate hotel gyms.   I kind of have a little ritual when I'm in NY, particularly when I have no plans in the evening.  I usually try to walk back to my hotel (about a 40-block hike), go to a deli for sushi or the salad bar, order a cheesy romantic comedy on my TV that I'd never pay for with my own money, watch it, and then at about 9pm I'll go to the hotel gym.  I go late because I hate working out when the gym is crowded.    So I was all alone two nights ago, until this short, stocky guy came in to ruin my workout time.  I was on the treadmill, minding my own business and listening to Coldplay (of course), and this guy starts up the treadmill right next to mine.  He had it going the fastest speed possible, and kind of gave me a look like 'check  this  out.'  I was not impressed.  He was running his little heart out, with me continuing my walk at a normal brisk pace.  I guess I didn't give him enough positive feedback, because he then proceeded to raise the incline.  I swear, I think his treadmill was almost at 90 degrees at one point.  By this time he was completely staring me down, wondering why I wasn't giving him a round of applause.  This totally wigged me out, so I just left.  Then last night, I went down at the same time, started my workout, and who showed up  again ...weirdo runner guy.  He gave me the stare down again, this time with a sly smile and wink that said 'I'm blatantly hitting on you'...so then I blatantly went back to my room.  Telling a guy like this off is usually no use.  But if I see him again next week, I'm going to punch him in the neck, or at least give him a piece of my mind.  And since I have longer strides than him, I'll run him into the ground for sure.          "

"            THE WEDNESDAY FIVE by DJS, yo.    1. What was the last song you heard?   You've Been Flirting Again  by Bjork It's an acoustic version I got on a bootleg CD.  Rumor has it, the Swan Princess is planning a North American tour (no dates set yet).  I've already decided that I'll go wherever I have to, just to see her again.  Can someone say ROADTRIP?  Or CYBERFARE, at least.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   Old School  - A comedy classic.  I don't know who I think is funnier: Will Farrell or Vince Vaughn.  Both of them are comedic geniuses who are extremely good at what they do.  If I were to cite a favorite moment, it would have to be when Will is shot with the tranquilizer dart and he's lying in a heap beneath some chairs at a kid's birthday party.  The best part is, he doesn't want to stay down and he gets up with a slow-mo groan.  Insert laughs here.   The Good Girl  - I've seen it already, but I bought it off of my brother for $10 on DVD.  I think the movie is sheer comedy genius.  Maybe a bit unbelievable, but then again: why see a movie if you expect it to be believable all the time?  I usually don't like Jenny Aniston, but she was pretty good in this flicky-poo.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  - A burrito from Chipotle for lunch yesterday.  Need I say more?  Mmmm....delicious. - Everclear's new album - Slow Motion Daydream.  I think I'm one of the few people on the planet that still really like these guys.  I'm going to see them in concert at First Avenue in a couple of weeks.  I can hardly wait. - Laundry detergent.  DJ LZ said we were low on the stuff, so I got it when I bought my CD.  Two jugs of Surf, comin' up!      4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  - Begin editing my 2nd book.  Yucka. - Shop for paint and such.  We're going to paint our last room.  The big 'un. - Install two lights in our upstairs hallway. - Work out a schedule where I can: write, read, workout, learn how to play guitar, play video games, and get everything else done.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?   Jeremy the German  - The IT guy who is repsonsible for installing the time-consuming yet fun Photoshop on my PC.  If there's been a lack of posts from me, blame the good people at Adobe.  It's tre fun.  Terri the Mexi-Canadian  - She's my neighbor at work across the aisle from me.  Amazingly, she's shown up for work everyday this week.  Then again, it IS only Wednesday.  Liz the Caucasian  - The supervisor for the CCS team delivered two delicious roast beef sandwiches to my cube, no C.O.D. required.  I guess I'll catch her on the flipside or something.  I offered to cut a check.  Offer refused.  Cim the Irish(?)  - She's out today because her little guy is sick.  I'm not sure if she's Irish or what, but her hair is reddish and it IS almost St. Patrick's day.  Mike the Fat Blob of Shit  - He waddled by and asked if Cim was out today.  I told him she was.  See above.  (I don't think we have any Jews working here.)          "
"           Because I took a sick day on Friday I almost forgot...   THE FRIDAY/MONDAY/TUESDAY FIVE, by Panda.    1. What was the last song you heard?   God Put a Smile Upon Your Face  by Coldplay I'm really excited to see this band again this summer...I've been listening to this album a lot...not as much as Hal, though.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   The Safety of Objects : Excellent.  Cool twist at the end. Tremendous cast - including the hottie drug dealer guy from the movie  Go .  Plus Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek cutie) plays a paralyzed guy.  That's weird.  All the Real Girls : Sweet movie, sad ending...you'll cry your eyes out if you have ever been in love.  Hell, you'll cry your eyes out anyway.  Paul Schneider is the next big thing.  You heard it here first.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Oatmeal w/banana at 'Sushi Deli Flowers' this morning here in NY.  Salad and a pack of gum at 'Terry's' for lunch.  I guess that's 3 things, albeit boring.  I plan on going shopping after work today (I can't pass Sephora in Times Square without twitching) so there will be more things added to this list later.     4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Drink, shop, laugh, and...drink.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  Suketu (sits next to me) My lady boss (she's a high-maintenance Jewess - I swear, she is always eating) My man boss (he's a wimpy little fella - wrote a haiku about him once) Myself (I think people are looking at me funny...) The Fella (he makes me smile and likes to cook stuff for me - next meal: Vegetable Biryani, an Indian delight!)          "
"           Stoner,  HAL and I had a little discussion last night.  We will go somewhere other than Half Time under 2 conditions:  1) You get down on your knees (this was HAL's idea).  2) And you utter 5 simple words....    'GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE.'    It's that simple.          "
"           Friends,  I'm in agreement with Ms. Stoner.  I'm all about the good times, so I'd like to avoid a high-volume crowd if possible.  If it gets to the point that we can't even move or talk to each other, fun times will not be had by all.  Tis' true that EVERY bar is an Irish bar on St. Pat's day.  As for singing, I'm down with that.  I'm just going to hope that a couple of you kids will rock the mic as well.  What's the worst that can happen?  And yes...I think burritos are in order for PBJ2.  Mo' definitely.          "
"           I'm not so hot on the Half Time idea...I know, Irish and all, but every bar is Irish when it's St. Patrick's Day. I want to go somewhere with karaoke, so I can see DJS perform again.         "
"           And by the way, if there  is  a jig re-match, let's hope we don't have to compete with the likes of  urlLink these guys .  They would win for sure.          "
"           Stoner, I talked to HAL on Saturday and this is what I know:  Friday: You are taking us out to dinner. (You're just leading, not paying - no worries!)  Then HAL is meeting up with us when she gets in.  Girl's night - ow!  Saturday: PBJ2!  HAL suggested Half Time.  I don't care, as long as there's beer.          "
"           All:  Is PBJ2 on Saturday night? I'm assuming it is, due to the traveling agendas of most of the Pandyland crew. I also have a perhaps more important question - is there going to be karaoke? A jig off rematch? Burritos?  Please send deets as they arrive.  Thanks, Stoner  p.s. Sorry Duf, but I am not posting the new cell number. I've gotten enough strange phone calls.         "

"            1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I read fiction 99% of the time, but I like non-fiction and poetry too.    2. What is your favorite novel?  It is almost impossible for me to answer that question.  I have so many favorites (ask HAL).  But, if I had to pick one book, I would pick  Moby Dick .    3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Why Regret By Galway Kinnell  Didn't you like the way the ants help the peony globes open by eating off the glue? Weren't you cheered to see the ironworkers sitting on an I-beam dangling from a cable, in a row, like starlings, eating lunch, maybe baloney on white with flourescent mustard? Wasn't it a revelation to waggle from the estuary all the way up the river, the pirle, the kill, the run, the brook, the beck, the sike gone dry, to the shock of a spring? Didn't you almost shiver, hearing the book lice clicking their sexual syncopation inside the old Webster's  New International  - perhaps having just eating out of it  izle, xyster  and  thalassacon ? What did you imagine lay in store anyway at the end of a world whose sub-substance is ooze, gleet, birdlime, slime, mucus, muck? Don't worry about becoming emaciated - think of the wren and how little flesh is needed to make a song. Didn't it seem somehow familiar when the nymph split open and the magfly struggled free and flew and perched and then its own back split open and the imago, the true adult, somersaulted out backwards and took flight toward the swarm, mouth-parts vestigial alimentary canal unfit to digest food, a day or hour left to find the desired one? Or when Cassonova threw the linguine in squid ink out the window, telling his startled companion, 'The perfected lover does not eat.' As a child didn't you find it calming to think  of the pinworms as some kind of tiny batons giving cadence to the squeezes and releases around the downward march of debris? Didn't you once glimpse what seemed your own inner blazonry in the monarchs, wobbling  and gliding, in desire, in the middle air? Weren't you reassured at the thought that these flimsy, hinged beings might navigate their way to Mexico by the flair of the dead bodies of ancestors who fell in the same migration a year ago? Isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?  [please don't sue me, Galway]   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The great works of Russian Literature.  Up next:   The Brothers Karamazov  and  War and Peace .  Yep, Duf' is serious.    5. What are you currently reading?   The Body Artist  by Don Delillo. Up next:  rereading  Lonesome Dove  by Larry McMurtry.          "

"           Wow, Stoner.  That's a weird and creepy story.  Good luck with that new number.  So I've been doing some field research on an oddly fascinating phenomena:   Golden Tee games are almost always right next to the jukebox in a bar.   And this gets me in trouble...mostly because of another fact I've uncovered:   Guys who play Golden Tee are total chachis and have no hope of ever sleeping with a woman.   Last night I was at a local tavern, enjoying some free beers because one of my friends won a free happy hour.  (cha-ching!)  Of course, I made a bee-line to the jukebox in order to dominate the song choices for the evening.  As usual, there were a few frat-boy chachis gathered 'round Golden Tee.  They were all giving each other high fives and other such frat guy behavior.  I was just ignoring them, and picking my usual song favorites.  Then one of these guys decides to be a smart ass and rips on one of my choices...it happened to be a U2 song.    He had no idea what he got himself into.  Even while sober I probably would have let him have it, but since I had a few cocktails by that time, it was no holds barred.  'Hmmm, thanks for sharing your fine opinion on music with me.  Sorry I'm not as cool as you and didn't pick some lame-ass Dave Matthews song.  Oh, and by the way, you've just proved my theory.  Guys who play Golden Tee really don't have a penis.  Thanks!'  Needless to say, he was pissed, but didn't bother me for the rest of the night.  Stupid, stupid boy.          "
"            I had to change my cell phone number today.    Since I got it in late December, Ive gotten about two no number calls a day  they never leave messages. I assumed it would taper off as people realized that Im not the person theyre looking for. Twice, Ive gotten messages from the parents of a girl named Amber, asking her to call home. I dont know the number for home, so cant call them back to tell them Im not Amber.   After my vacation, I had a message from a woman named Sharon. She didnt give me the reason for her call, she just sounded very professional and left an 800 number. I thought my finances were in trouble or something, because she works for some sort of bank. When I spoke with her, she said she found my number in her husbands wallet. Hes a trucker, and she knows hes been messing around with hookers  and she assumed I was one of them. We cleared up the confusion when I said I get calls for a guy named Dan and a girl named Amber  apparently the scrap of paper in her hubbies wallet said Amber on it.   The last straw, though, came last night. I got a creepy voicemail in a heavily-accented males voice that just said I know who you are I decided I didnt want to know who he was. So I switched it.   I wonder who had my new number last? Hopefully, not another hooker         "
"            I have no self control when it comes to chocolate.    All day long Ive been trying not to eat it  not because I gave it up or anything, but because I eat entirely too much of it. Ive been scarfing it down on a daily basis since about a month prior to Halloween. Here, the candy stream never stops.   Right now theres a whole bunch of FastBreak and KitKat and Almond Joy and other wonderfully delicious mini candy bars, all about 10 feet away from me. Every time I turn around I can see it. The only time I dont think about the bag o chocolate is when I am in a meeting, behind a closed door and distracted by the topic at hand. B  ut now it is 4 pm and my other coworkers are going home, and that means I am going to be alone with the bag. After 4 pm is when it gets the worst. I start to get hungry for dinner, and the mini candy bars sound better and better.   If I have to use the fax machine, Im screwed. Its right next to the bag. How can I hold myself back?          "

"           Thanks Hal.  I feel much better.  So I've been thinking about what I should 'give up' during the Lenten season.  This is a lot of pressure - I mean, I already have to stop eating meat on Fridays, and then there's the whole Easter Vigil thing on Holy Saturday which is just about the longest mass in existence.  When I still sang in the Cathedral choir, this was the Big One...the one we all dreaded because it meant we had to stand for 3 hours straight.  And we didn't get to stand in the choir loft in back, but smack dab in the front, in front of the entire congregation, sweating to death and feeling like we're all gonna faint.  So, yes, Lent is a lot about sacrifice (considering everything JC did on the cross and all), but why does it have to be?  Instead of 'giving something up', I'm going to try and be a better person...at least for 40 days.  How am I going to do that?  Well, I'll start by buying all my friends in Minneapolis a round when I'm in town next week.  And then I'll try not to yell at old ladies in the bus anymore.  And then for the finale, I will make sure to (try) and keep my mouth shut when I see someone dressed like a slut.  It's the least I can do.  In other news, if anyone has been keeping score: Mike Walsh of  urlLink 'Bowling Roadtrip'  fame, has finished bowling in all 50 states.  He is also the first person in history to have ever bowled in Alaska AND Hawaii  all in the same day .  Congrats Mike and welcome home...and good luck writing the book.          "
"           Hi Pandys...  Panda, while I feel that guilt is usually a pointless emotion, I feel that it's especially true when considering Ash Wednesday service.  God really doesn't care if you're there or not.  He's got like 6 billion people to worry about, and so he stopped tracking church attendance ages ago.  Unfortunately, he's been keeping this info on the down-low, so not a lot of people are aware of this.  Plus, The Church doesn't even consider it a holy day, so even the bureaucrats don't care.  On the plus side, Santa is still keeping a naughty/nice list, so the pure-of-heart are still rewarded, while the evil are punished.  Yesterday I went to Ash Wednesday Mass with Duf and Anjali (I thought it was nice that they joined me).  It had a 'centering' effect on us (or at least me), but it was quickly lost on Duf when he later had a little run-in with the valet at our hotel.    BTW, sorry DJS, there were no photos taken of me with ashes on the fo' head.  But I could probably recreate the look in MN with some dark eye shadow, if you like.  Later friends, Hal         "

"            Ash Wednesday: not just about walking around with dirt on your forehead   So I got this e-mail from my mom this morning: 'This is a day in the Church of Fast (no meat) and Abstinence (no eating between meals). Start to prepare for Easter, the holiest of seasons in the Church.  Join the Holy Father and pray for world peace!!  In case you  urlLink do not get to Church !'  My mom can be a little overbearing at times, God love her, but she means well.  I read this feeling a tinge of guilt knowing I probably  won't  make it to mass today, but thank God she put the little clause in there - I can just click on that link and all worries are gone!  So I'll pray for world peace, and I'll even abstain from eating meat, but no eating between meals is going to be tough...especially considering my mom just gave me 5 boxes of Girl Scout Cookies and they're sitting on my desk right now.  Damn Thin Mint temptations!  This is going to be a rough day.          "

"            First off, welcome back, Stoner!    Second off, here's my F5 on a Monday...    1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I'm always reading something, but the bulk of it is newspapers and magazines.  My favorite newspapers are the NY Times and the StarTribune.  My favorite magazine is Vanity Fair, and Entertainment Weekly is something I'll eventually have to wean myself off of.  I also like reading both novels and non-fiction books.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My two all time faves are The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Life After God by Douglas Coupland (though I dont think this one is technically a novel).  I also have to site To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee as a sentimental favorite  Ms. Tyson read it to us in seventh grade, and it taught me that books read in school can be cool.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Okay, its not exotic, and probably says more about the fact that I saw The Outsiders at an impressionable time in my life than anything else but here goes:  Natures first green is gold Her hardest hue to hold Her early leafs a flower; But only so an hour Then leaf subsides to leaf So Eden sank to grief So dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Im a slow reader and I have to have great interest in anything to read it, so I have a pile of books that I swear Ill get to but I never will, and books that I made it 1/2 way through, and I swear I'll complete.   5. What are you currently reading?  Tender Is The Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I told CK2 how much I liked The Great Gatsby and she told me that I would like TITN even better.  So Im being obedient.  I just started it, so its too early to tell if its as good.   Third off, I'm in a ridiculously good mood this morning... I don't know why.  It is Monday, fer chrissakes...          "

"           I highly recommend booking a last minute cruise to the Caribbean in the middle of winter. Its cheap, you get to eat tons and tons of good food, and you get to sit in the sunshine.   Here are five of my favorite things from the trip:   1. Trying new foodstuffs.  I ate escargot for the first time in my life, and was introduced to guavaberry rum  which is really tasty in guavaberry coladas.   2. St. John  the island.  This extremely beautiful place is over 90% national park, which means its clean, not chintzy at all, and the snorkeling is cheap. Which brings me too   3. Sea Creatures.  Snorkeling was a blast  we saw stingrays, a shark, crab, squid (possibly) and an incredible range of tropical fish.   4. Folded towels.  Every night, our cabin steward gave us fresh towels shaped like animals  including a monkey, wearing my sunglasses.   5. Last but not least.  I thoroughly enjoyed having super-extended honey time. It was nice to not have to go to work every day, just to play and do whatever we wanted. And I was very happy to find out that after 7 nonstop days, I still cant get enough of the guy.           "
"           Kellogg's sent me a quick response.  Thanks, Rosemary:   Thank you for contacting us about your suggestion for Kellogg's(R)Special K(R)Red Berries. While your idea is not new to us, we appreciate your interest and the time you took to submit this idea.  Our company devotes a great deal of time and effort to developing new and improved products, packaging concepts, promotions and merchandising ideas, such as recipe ideas and alternate serving suggestions, to make our products the best on the market.  When this product was first produced Kellogg Company tried different fruit additions.  From the information we have received the name originated because there were more than strawberries added.  Due to consumer review strawberries were chosen as the only fruit to be added.  We are happy that you are enjoying the product.  Again, thank you for contacting us; we appreciate your interest in our company and products.  Rosemary Consumer Affairs Department   On the bottom of Rosemary's very unremarkable retort, there was a push to remember to eat breakfast...   National School Breakfast Week is the perfect time to remind parents of the importance of eating a good breakfast.  Findings from studies conducted by nutrition research organizations continue to support the fact that children who eat breakfast do better academically and behave better in school than those who do not.  The key reason...not eating breakfast means that blood sugar levels remain too low to allow for proper concentration.  Adults can suffer the same problems when they skip breakfast.  So, remember to treat your children...and yourself...to a nutritious breakfast each and every day.  Our cereals and meal-on-the-go products can help!  Go to the Nutrition section of www.kelloggs.com to learn more.   It's looks to me Kellogg's so-called 'studies' are just pushing people to buy more of their product.  My brother always ate breakfast when we were growing up and that never made him 'behave better.'  What a crock.           "
"            Waging War   I've had it and I'm now officially standing up for my cause.  If any of you know me very well at all, you'll know I have a severe distaste for smokers.  I won't bother listing all of the things that bug me about the filthy habit because it's been said before.  But let's just say this: some people are passionate about peace, other about animal rights.  This time I'm not fighting the smokers for myself or any other human being.  I'm going to war for the tree.  Across the street from our building is a lone pine tree that has to sit at the edge of the property.  It is this tree that every smoker from across the street gathers to engage in their ceremony of stink.  All kinds of pigs waddle across the lawn to get to this poor tree to light up, bitch about work, and smoke to their tar-stained heart's content.  Now, if you know most smokers (like I do) they don't bother disposing of their filthy habit properly.  Take a drive on the freeway for example.  How often do you see some asshole fire a butt out the window because he doesn't want to 'stink up his car' or 'surround himself in his disgusting weakness?'  The same applies for the poor pine tree.  They fire their butts on the ground and pollute the poor tree with their rancid smoke screens.  So, what I'm doing is making signs that I'm going to put in the ground next to the tree.  They're going to be high-quality signs that will be laminated, fastened to a pointed stick and inserted into the ground.  The signs are going to have little messages on them that will (hopefully) make the smokers feel like gruesome beasts and remind them of what social lepers they are.  One sign will say:   Hey Smokers!  This is the Pine Tree Talking:  PICK UP YOUR BUTTS. I dont want to suffer because  of your filthy habit.   Another one says:   Mmmmm.Delicious Cigarettes.   You know what else is delicious???  CANCER. Enjoy Your Day.   -The Tree   I'm planning on making 12 different signs.  I will plant them one week from today and let the fun begin.  Of course, I'll keep everyone up to date on what happens.  I can see the tree and all of the sweathogs that go down there to smoke from my desk.          "
"           Last night, I saw Pete Yorn play live.  In addition to being a looker, the guy puts on a good show.  In fact, it exceeded my (admittedly modest) expectations.  As DJS might put it, me likey.  Speaking of DJS, Pete sang a song called 'burrito'.  I can't believe he's not DJS's soul mate.  On the surreal-in-a-good way front, I ran into a friend from high school at the show.  Its always really weird to see someone youve barely known since you were both 17 telling you that shes been married for 3 years.  Plus, she works in the same industry as I do, and thus actually understands what our company does no small feat.  The music, the blast-from-the-past, the nicotine and alcohol all spun together to make me quite woosy.  Im having a groggy morning.           "

"            Shit.  You'd Think I Never Posted Anymore (mostly I'm afraid of Stoner bringing up Justin Timberlake again)...by DJS Inc.    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  Since I don't watch much TV, I have to back to Wednesday.  I watched the last half of a show called 'Extreme Makeovers.'  It's about how 2 ugly people (through the miracles of science and plastic surgery) get to be okay-looking.  It was gross.  One woman had lips to Rhode Island and the other had a face that looked like it'd been caught in 12 violent hailstorms.   2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  That I couldn't remember a movie I'd wanted to see (and possibly buy) at Suncoast.  I figured it out, Duf.  It was called  urlLink Series 7 .   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  Wow.  I think it was yesterday.  I told my bestest, lovey, honey-bear, snookums, tender-morsel (DJ LZ) that I thought she looked cute.  And she did.   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  A half hour (more like 45 minutes) going to the MOA (Mall of America) with Duf Daddy.  We had time to burn, friends.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  Shit.  I don't know.  urlLink FARK?           "

Im not even wearing pants today.    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  I flipped between the Today Show (Ive still got something for that Matt Lauer) and Good Morning America (or GMA to those of us in the know).  Katie (ugh) was interviewing Al Pacino, and Diane (love her!) and Charlie were chatting about reality TV.    2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  I didnt vocalize it, but this morning I was upset about how long the wait was at Caribou.  I thought to myself there has to be a way for this to be more efficient.  Most of these people are headed to work!  I shouldnt have stopped.  Yeah, I should have.  Next time I should go to Dunn Bros.  Sebastian Joes is usually quick too Maybe its just slow because its Friday  Something along those lines.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  It was indirect  last night I was working on a gift for a friend and I wrote that I felt lucky to know her.  We havent given it to her yet (its a group gift) so she has not yet received the complement.   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  My O.J. container, and my coffee cup.  Dont know which went first.  I drink a lot in the morning.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  The Internet Movie Database.  Im a junkie.          "
"            Hal is the Center of My Universe or Sits Near Me, You Decide The Friday Five by Duf Fer    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  Fox 9 News - I was desperate (I feel like this gives the wrong impression of my television viewing habits).   2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  I complained to Hal about co-workers who were complaining about a co-worker when the complaining co-workers are very far from complain-proof.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  All of my answers are giving the wrong idea, but I told Hal that I liked her pants (in a HR friendly way, or at least I think it was an HR friendly way - I wasn't leering or anything).   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  A note to Hal asking her about her availability for golf the week of May 12 (with our boss and a bean counter who works with us).      5.

I drank some for a few days, and got terrible headaches, until I realized I was WRONG in my assumption that black tea has just as much caffeine as coffee. As it turns out, this stuff has half as much. So I started taking Advil to mask the pain.   I decided I want to kick caffeine a while back, but really cemented the decision on a recent trip to my honeys hometown. I realized its kind of pathetic to have to make a special trip to Burger King for coffee. (No Starbucks in his town  too small.)    Plus my doctor told me to cut back in order to reduce PMS.

Kerry, and, most of all Sen Harry Reid of Nevada (former employer).   2. Who is your least favorite?  Osama Bin Laden (for obvious reasons) Jim Carrey (sorry, I don't get it - I never have actually) Lleyton Hewitt (the tennis player - still haven't gotten over the racist comment directed at James Blake in the 2001 U.S. Open, I will root against him until he is dead; he makes me hate Kim Cjlisters (his girlfriend) and he give me reservations about Australia) Alanis Morissette (I can't explain it, I'm a total hater.)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Met is a strong word seen is easier.  I bumped into Oprah as faithful readers know.  I saw Alison Janney at the L.A. Arboretum (no bra!) and John Ritter at Amoeba Records (uncombed hair!).  I just saw Nick Collison (graduating forward for the Kansas Jayhawk basketball team) at Yello Sub (best subs in the lower 48) in Lawrence, Kansas (the 23rd street location, not the Jayhawk Boulevard location).  Rick Fox small forward for the L.A. Lakers at (then) Dayton's in downtown Mizzapolis.  I talked to the poet Anne Carson (stared at my crotch the whole time - 'hey, poet, I'm up here!').  I've seen Duante Culpepper (Vikings Quarterback) and Stephon Marbury (Phoenix Suns guard) at the airport.  I talked to (former Vice Presidential candidate) Geraldine Ferraro in her office for about 15 minutes (couldn't take her eyes off my crotch BTW).  I've met and talked to Maya Angelou (writer, poet) and Gordon Parks (photographer, artist) and Jesse Ventura (wrestler, governor).  I saw Prince driving a Ford Taurus in Minnetonka once.  George Steinbrenner at a Yankess spring training game.  I sat on a plane next to General Westmoreland (commanded the troops in Vietnam -   loves   his gin gibsons BTW).  I rapped with Jesus once in college (vey, vey drunk, friends, vey drunk).  A few Presidents (the elder Bush (S.A.C.), Gore (counting as President) and Reagan)...My contacts have all been so slight that I'm sure I'm forgetting some.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   Not even for one second.  I'm not sure I would want to be rich.  I definitely would not want to be powerful, and of the three, the one I want the least if fame.  What a burden.  If I had to choose one between rich, powerful or famous, I would reluctantly choose rich.  I'd put them in this order rich, powerful, famous.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  Tiger Woods - for the golf, baby.  I know it's boring, but I cannot tell a lie.  I would pick Tiger for the golf.          "

Bono (for his music, sex appeal, charity work, and for pissing off DJS) Kate Hudson (could she be any cuter?...plus, she's the poster child for flat women everywhere.) J. Lo (not so much cuz I like her, but because she always gives us crap to talk about) Claire Danes (she's been in some great indy films and was in the best show on TV - My So-Called Life) Vince Vaughn (love the funny, smartass attitude.  Ms. T partied with him in LA and said he was even cooler in person)   2. Who is your least favorite?  Saddam Hussein (for obvious reasons) Renee Zellweger (I have no idea what the fascination is) Britney Spears (that carnie-looking wanna-be virgin freak) Jennifer Aniston (she always looks like she's constipated) Any Super Model (eat already) Andie MacDowell (worst actress ever.  stop your whining.) Mariah Carey (no-talent slut) Katie Couric (hiding behind that crazy smile is a cuckoo liberal bitch)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Never met, just seen.  I saw Sarah Jessica Parker while I was shopping in the village.  Queen Latifah when I was dining with Thong (v. embarrassing).  The guy from the B-52's while walking through Soho (don't even know his name).  Rosie Perez was in front of me in line at the friends-and-family sale at J Crew on 5th Ave.  For the record, she was not looking good without make-up...and she bought about $400 worth of clothes.  Wait, one more...I saw Elizabeth Hurley in Marshall Fields on State St here in Chi.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?    I think it would be a blast.  I'm a sucker for some good drama, so why not get the paparazzi involved?  I'd invite them shopping with me.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?

I'll even admit to getting into a bidding war with some Kraut over an picture of her framed with an autographed CD in there.  The final price ended up being $312.00.  Guess who won???   2. Who is your least favorite?  I've got a bunch.  Here goes (in no order)  1. Oprah Winfrey (see earlier posts) 2. Dick Clark (there's a reason people call him 'Dick') 3. Jennifer Garner (have no idea why she's famous) 4. Horse-faced Julia Roberts (no talent, big-toothed psychopath) 5. Bill Cosby (mugging, annoying, holier than thou jello-eating jerk) 6. Dave Matthews (yodeling frat-boy rock idiot) 7. J Lo (phony, over-exposed head-case) 8. Sean Connery (egotistical wife-beating drunk) 9. Rosie O'Donnell (head like a medicine ball, loud-mouth freakshow) 10. Avril Lavigne (it upsets me that I even know her name) 11. Michael Jordan (retire for good, you has-been) 12. Dale Earnhardt Sr. & Jr. (one down, one to go) 13. Justin Timberlake (I want him dead.  get an identity, white-boy) (to be continued)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?  Yep.  I've met Brendan Fraser (nice guy), Uma Thurman (she touched me 3 times), Timothy Hutton (asked me how I was doing), Michael Rappaport (prick), Steven Wright (my mom embarassed him in an elevator), Emilio Estevez (bumped into him), Joel Coen (shook his hand and introduced myself).  People I've just seen: Natalie Portman, Martha Plimpton, Queen Latifa, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jean Claude Van Damme, Joe Pesci, Joshua Jackson, Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, Kid (from Kid N Play) there might be some more but I can't think of 'em.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   I don't know if I'd want to be famous because t would suck for everyone to know who you are.  The minute you do something stupid, everyone knows about it.  I guess I wouldn't mind being well-known, you know?  Like if one of my books takes off and people on the street say 'Hey, aren't you the guy who wrote...?'  That would be pretty cool, I reckon.  Yeah.  Well-known.  That'd be all right with me.  Oh...and rich, too.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  We did this question already, but I'll pick someone different this time.  I'd want to trade places with Steven Speilberg.  In one day, I'd green-light all the projects that came over from a certain DJS and I'd ask him if I could buy the rights to his children's book so that I could make it into a blockbuster family film.  If I was Steven Speilberg, I'd avoid Kate Capshaw...I don't know, tell her I was busy at work and wouldn't be able to come home.  That woman scares me.  Plus, she ruined the 2nd Indiana Jones movie with her horrible acting (dis)abilities.         "
"            Bestiality Discussion at Work   Thong has gone waaaaay too far this time.  Today she somehow got onto the subject of her dog's crotch.  And how her and her husband play with it.  I'm not kidding.  'He was laying on the couch with his legs spread, and I wanted to see what his balls felt like so I grabbed them.'  'My husband said 'Hey Thong, check this out.' And then he pulled back his foreskin to see the red lipstick.'  I seriously need a supply of airplane sickbags at my desk, because I feel like I'm going to vomit everytime she opens up her mouth.  Word of advice: don't tell your coworkers about playing with your dog's nads.  I think Rob wants to submit a haiku.          "

Any Eminem sightings, and I'll be sure to tell you.  I don't think I'd say 'I love you' to him if I do see him, but we'll see.          "
"           Hal, in this case, when the L-Bomb is used with a celebrity (b-list or otherwise), it never means 'in love'.  Like when I told Bono I loved him at the U2 show we were at (well, I didn't tell him as much as hollered  at  him).  Bono and I are not at that 'level' yet.  So it just means I like him a whole lot.  With that chachi Jaime from the Bachelorette, telling him I loved him was a desperate attempt to get him to talk to me.  I wasn't really feelin' it.   You  saying it to Bono, on the other hand, is a whole other story.           "

That didn't seem to get me any points, so then I desperately told him I loved him.  (Yeah, good move.  Because most guys are so turned on when complete strangers tell them they love them.)  He said 'Thanks.'  And then ran away as fast as he could.  Hmmmm...did I come on too strong?             "

"            We Must Be Popular (nah...that's not it)   You may be wondering why there's sometimes a high-quality (snicker) picture up above and why sometimes there's nothing but an empty space and a little red X.  I know I did.  Well, it turns out that the place I use to host pictures only lets the page be viewed a certain number of times before they say 'Eff this.  You're taking up too much bandwidth.'  Bandwidth is nerd-speak for computer power.  So, one would deduce that our crappy little site is becoming somewhat popular because a bunch of people must've stopped by and caused the Sopranos picture to go away.  Anyway, long story short, I made a new picture (by request) and it should be up top tomorrow morning.

"           Ive been remiss in reporting on my recently viewed movies.  So here goes:   urlLink This  was REALLY great, thanks to Duf for the recommendation.  I especially enjoyed the Parker Posey segment.  She rocks.   urlLink This  was okay.  I had heard it talked up a lot, and I am a sucker for Campbell Scott (ever since  urlLink Singles ).  He had me at I just happened to be nowhere near your neighborhood.  Anyway, it was just too big on the smug, and too little on the clever.  Even with that, it was much better than   urlLink This movie .  Panda and I spent most of the flick going what the?, and not it a good way.  Im no sucker for Mickey Rourke, so I had no love for him as a drug cook.  Needless to say, if you like Jason Schwartzman, just watch  urlLink Rushmore  again.  Then your heart will not be broken.  This movie sucked.  Unless youre into John Leguizamo wearing only a sock.  Than this is the flick for you.  There.  Now I feel much better.          "

"            1. Favorite drink?  That's easy:  it's vodka and tonic.  My favorite vodkas are, in this order:  Grey Goose, Belvedere, Stolichnaya, Absolut, and Ketel One.  I'd also like to give a shout out to the vodka martini up, eight to one with an extra olive and to the Manhattan.    2. Favorite bar?  W.A. Frost in St. Paul is my favorite Twin Cities haunt.  Johnny's Tavern in Lawrence, Kansas, my favorite spot of all.  I also have to give a nod to two bars in D.C.: The Hawk and Dove and The Sign of the Whale.    3. Most hungover  When I was in college, one night I got so drunk that I kissed a man (not on the lips, yo), walked off a porch and fell into a thorn bush, and then had a hard time keeping my vision clear (so drunk I had blurry vision).  The next morning, I woke up drunk with a stabbing pain in my head.  That was because I 'fell asleep' on the bathroom floor with my sunglasses on and they were pressing into my cranium.  Anyway, I went to register for class and pay fees. It was the beginning of the fall semester, so all these parents from KC were escorting their youngsters through the process.  I was waiting in line for my scholarship (with my wayfarers all the way on and my high top fade haircut faded very high, thank you) and the urge to purge fell on me (all the way on me).  I went to the bathroom and it was packed.  Every stall was taken and every urinal too.  I could not wait and got sick in the trash can while fathers and sons looked on me with disgust.  It was the beginning of a hangover that almost did Duf' in.           "

"            Allow me to apologize...   Im sorry if we didnt call you, and Im especially sorry if we did call you.  My memory of Wednesday is very vague.  I am not yet aware of why we were on the phone so much to begin with, but Im sure Ill remember soon.  That said, this is an ironic set of Qs.   1. Favorite drink?  Gin and Tonic.  Specifically, Tanqueray and Tonic, and for those special occasions, Tanqueray 10 and Tonic.  I also like vodka  Panda introduced me to flavored Stoli, which is very nice.  Im not a fan of dark booze, like whiskey or tequila, though I do like a rum and coke one and awhile.  I also adore beer and wine.  Wow, now Im thirsty.   2. Favorite bar?  Easy.  The Hangee Uppee in Chi-town.    3. Most hungover  24 hours ago.  Picture waking up in a hotel room with the lights and television on, and shaking.  Then realizing that you have to pack (!!!), go into work (double !!!), and then get on two airplanes (hello, aisle seat!).  Luckily, I am never drinking again, so I dont have to worry about hangovers anymore.         "
"            1. Favorite drink?  Ive always loved the Captain Morgan  along with some delicious Coke. Other faves include, but are not limited to, bloody Marys, Newcastle Brown Ale, Sangria, cider, all types of wine, vodka martinis (with really good olives  mmmchipotle stuffed olives), Leinies, Harp, Miller Lite, amaretto sours, and mimosas.   2. Favorite bar?  That would have to be the Hart and Spool, our pub from Borehamwood. I also really liked the bar we went to in Portland, which was a converted elementary school (even though it creeped me out a little  something about being in a school at night while drinking).    3. Most hungover  Ouch. I get hungover pretty much every time I drink nowadays. I havent puked for a while though  which is good. The last time I puked, it was after a moderate night out. The phone rang, I jumped up, answered it, said I gotta go, and then ran for the bathroom. I like not being lil sicky though          "
"            Sharing Too Much Time with DJS    1. What's your favorite drink?  Why?  Wow.  This changes almost daily.  I'm a simple man with simple mean, so I enjoy the occasional beer.  If I were to go to the store right now and pick up a 6-er, I'd probably get Miller High Life which, as you all should know, is the Champagne of Beers.  I don't know.  Every since Dirty and I went to Milwaukee to see Tenacious D and enjoyed the brewery tour, I'm sold.  It's delicious.  (insert white trash jokes here)  If I'm going to have a drinky-drink, I'd go with a Vodka Sour or possibly a citrus-y drink mixed in with Bacardi Limon or O.  Those give me my 'O' face.  Oh, oh, oh...   2. What's your favorite bar?  Tell me about it.  Even thought I haven't been there in ages, I'm going to go with The German Bar or Gasthaus Zur Gumitlikeit (or some shit like that)  They play polka music, serve beer that I don't really enjoy drinking, and it's usually crowded and hot as hell.  Why do I like it?  It's usually a pretty good crowd.  You can do snuff, drink beer from a boot, the bartender there gives me a free shot EVERY time I go in there, and the waitresses are cool.  They wear funny wigs that look awful on them.  One of the waitresses even danced like a crazy woman with me one night.  She kind of reminded me of a poor-man's Bjork.  God bless her.   3. When was the last time you were really hungover?  Discuss.  It's been a while.  Oddly enough, I don't drink nearly as heavily as I used to.  Call it old age.  Whatever, jerks.  But, I'd have to go with the pub crawl in November of 2001.  I was between girlfriends at the time, and I had my sights set on 3 different potential female prospects.  Well, we started drinking waaaaaaaaay too early.  By the time I caught up with any of the women I had my eyes on, I was completely shitfaced and made a fool of myself.  I ended up making out with my (at the time) best-friend's girlfriend (she started it) and I fell asleep in my car with some girl I went to high school with outside my other friends house.  No, I hadn't been driving, but I was dog tired and full of booze.  Does anyone understand now why I don't drink so much anymore?  Thanks for your time, friends.         "

"            I like The Drink   Last night, over a low-ball glass of Makers & Coke, I was thinking about how much I like the Drink.  Now, I'm not talking about liking that drink in particular, but The Drink.  The Booze.  The Pint.  The Occasional Snootful.  The Elixir.  Then I thought  why ?  Why do I like it so?  Let me tell you.  The drink makes you feel powerful.  Sexy.  Vulnerable.  Relaxed.  Crazed.  Energized.  Sad.  Depending on what you drink, you can feel all these things at once.  Margaritas make me feel festive.  Wine makes me feel calm.  Beer makes me laugh.  A Vodka Tonic is my equivalent to speed.  So along those same lines, here's the  Thursday Three :   1. What's your favorite drink?  Why?  Flavored Stoli and Tonic.  I was  way  into this before all the cheap versions of flavored vodka came out.  What I'm really saying is, I invented this drink.  Stoli-O and Stoli-Razz give me the jump-start I need for a night on the town.   2. What's your favorite bar?  Tell me about it.  There is nothing glamorous about Monsignor Murphy's.  Basically, it's a dump.  It has Golden Tee next to the Jukebox (as you know, my biggest pet peeve).  It has cheesy sports paraphernalia on the walls.  Hal once posed with one of their numerous dart trophies.  BUT...they do have a beer garden in the summer, and they have one of the BEST jukeboxes in the city (Lots of U2 = Great Jukebox), they sometimes give me free shots, the bartenders have funny nicknames like Ziggy (although I've been known to call him Skippy when I'm hammered).  You also don't have to dress up to go there.  It's where everybody knows your name...or at least your favorite drink.   3. When was the last time you were really hungover?  Discuss.  I bet you I can guess it's this morning for Hal and Duf.  For me, it was about a month ago after my friend had a party at the Schoolyard Tavern.  The party was on a Thursday night, making the hangover feel even worse because I was supposed to go to work on Friday.  But I didn't.  I took a totally legitimate sick day.  And watched TLC all day long. Nothing can cure a lil' sickie hangover like 'The Dating Story.'          "

"            Those Voice-Mail Sluts   I got a choice VM from those 2 trouble makers last night too.  (and here I thought I was  special ...)  I was at the Green Mill, so it was difficult to hear what everyone said, but it was pretty similar to what Stoner decribes below.  I called back and got Duf on the line.   His response: 'You DO love me.'  Yes, Duf.  Very much.  Hal of course had to get on and give her 2 cents: 'I am SOOOO drunk right now.'  Do I detect a pattern?  Or did this just start after her corruption in Chi-town?            "

Hal: Hello? (blowing wind) Hellllloooooo? Hello? (more background noise) Hal: Hi-Stoner-I-was-going-to-leave-a-message-but-I-can't.

"            Happy Friday!    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  My parents house, Dowling Hall at UST (4 years, 4 different rooms), Borehamwood, SLP, and now my current place.  That makes a modest 5 (not counting the multiple Dowling abodes).   2. Which was your favorite and why?  Gotta go with Stoner  Borehamwood, baby.  It was also the lowest-quality housing Ive ever lived in Stoner didnt mention the mini-fridge (shared by all 7 of us), the lack of a clothes dryer (thats what the room heaters were for) or kitchen floor, and the mountain of garbage piled on the side of the house.  Not to mention dodging the television license people for 6 months.  Its kinda sad, but I wouldnt last 2 days in a place like that now.  Honorary mention goes to the apartment I had in Dowling.  Rent free, furninshed, plus free cable (and nearly unlimited C-Store access).  It was good.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  I can think of few things I hate more.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Location.  Hands down.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  I dont have a complete picture  but its an old place (and since this is a dream, I have the money to maintain it, and modernize it where needed).  Im within a walk to a coffee shop, a little restaurant, and a place to buy milk and I have cool neighbors.  There is no pool, but there is central air The bedroom is a good size, with a master bath hmmm I have to think about this more, I can come up with better stuff...          "
"            1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  House on Temple Court, first house in Woodbury, house in WI, townhouse in Woodbury, house in Woodbury, Dowling Hall at UST (four different rooms), flat in East Finchley, 107 Cleveland, house in Borehamwood, Carriage House on Summit, Somerset Oaks (that address is still on my drivers license), Westlake Estates (for one month), and now right by Lake Harriet (yet spending quite a bit of time in White Bear Lake).   That makes 16. Look out Duf - I'm almost caught up.    2. Which was your favorite and why?  House in Borehamwood  three guys, four girls, and over 30 guests in five months. Who could forget the jungle bathroom, the shed, the washing machine we had to keep closed with a broomstick, the skylights that blew into the neighbors yard every time the wind picked up, the psychic landlady who healed Christine and made us reupholster our own furniture, and the characters we met at the Hart and Spool.    3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  They used to be nothing but exciting  when I could fit all of my belongings into one car, and do all of the moving myself. Once you start roping people into lifting furniture, etc. it gets a little stressful. But I love unpacking and deciding where everything gets to go.    4. What's more important, location or price?  In my younger days, I was all about location. But now that I am older and increasingly poorer (yet wanting to live in a house someday, instead of an apartment) I am all about price. When it comes down to it, every location has its benefits. Inexpensive housing is a big one!   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?   My pie-in-the-sky dream house has plenty of windows, is near a lake, has a nice big yard for my non-drooling, non-pooping St. Bernard, and a sanctuary-like home office where I work on projects that make me happy, plenty of space for my kids to play  without the risk of choking, drowning, or electrocution  and the best damn shower in the tri-state area.            "
"            1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Are you ready for this?  The green house in Kansas City, the brown house in Kansas City, my grandparents house in Wichita, the apartment on Rock Road, Wichita, the condo on Bramblewood in Wichita, the condo on Woodlawn in Wichita, Joseph R. Pearson Hall, Lawrence Kansas, Roger Templin Hall, Lawrence, Kansas, an apartment on Fourth Street SW, Washington, D.C., the blue apartments in Lawrence, the brown apartment in Lawrence, the co-op in Dinkytown, the house on 7th street, Minneapolis, the apartment near St. Anthony Main, the townhouse uptown, the house in Golden Valley, the apartment uptown, the house on Chicago Avenue and the house in St. Paul on Iglehart.  Thats 19, friends (which means I have not averaged two years in any one place Im a nomad, a gypsy).     2. Which was your favorite and why?  A house is made of brick and stone, a home is made of love alone.  I would pick my current home as my favorite.  Awwwwwwww    3. Do you find moving houses more exciting or stressful? Why?  My goal is to move twice more in my life.  I would like to move into a home that I will raise a family in, then I would like to move when we empty nest.  That is all.  I HATE moving.  I find it stressful and tiring.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Right now I live in a very inexpensive house (purchased pre-bubbleif I told you our mortgage payment, you would all pass out), and I would gladly triply my mortgage for a better location.     5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  Gee, I have never thought about it (wink, wink).  There is a nice view (a lake or a city scape or wetlands.  I always liked wetlands).  And a wrap around porch (Cape Cod style, y'all).  Everyone has their own bedroom, plus there is a guest room and a separate study/den, there is a balcony off the master suite, all closets are walk in (there is an over-abundance of storage space, all bathrooms are so huge they border on gaudy  I have my own sink, basin and medicine cabinet), the kitchen is large enough to eat in, but not too large.  There is a dining room with seating for 12, there is a living room (no TV) and a family room (with a color TV so I can see, the Knicks play basketball), there is a media room (High-Def, DVD, stereo, those couches that shake with the bass), and a built-in stereo with speakers in all the key rooms, including the fitness room.  There is a finished walk-out basement with an 8 foot slate pool table.  In the backyard, there is room for a nice garden and for a putting green surrounded by sand traps.  There is also a writing studio that is topped by a greenhouse.  There is a tennis court, with basketball rims at each end, and there is a phat-ass garage.  The whole house is powered by on-site solar and wind energy and has a whole bunch of windows.  Last, there is an underground bunker supplied by its own independent filtered oxygen source and accessible from any floor in the house where we can escape when the terrorists attack (instead of duct taping plastic all over everything like suckas!).

"            Friday 5:  Done and....Done.   Sponsored by DJS    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Oh, sweet bearded Christ...there's the St. Anthony house with ma and pa shovelpants, then the apartment in New Brighton, then the shithole in Los Angeles, temporarily back to mom and dad's when I moved back, to the house behind Elsie's in Nordeast Minnecrapolis, then to the house in 'upper Nordeast', then a temporary stay in an apartment in Uptown, then back at mom and dad's (transitional), then back to the house in Nordeast, then to another apartment in Uptown, then another, then I moved in with DJ LZ on the busiest intersection in Uptown (Franklin & Hennepin) then finally to the townhouse in Woodbury where we're living happily ever after...until we move in about 3 years.  Lucky 13, baby.  But I'm counting each move.  That's how I do.   2. Which was your favorite and why?  I like our place in Woodbury.  It's ideal in every sense of the word.  Don't have to shovel snow, cut grass or any of that garbage.  Can't.  Busy.  Also, we can park both of our cars in the garage, we get to do laundry a mere 20 feet from where all of our clothes go and last but not least...it's quiet.  I don't hear filthy fat pigs riding around on their stupid Harley Davidsons, firetrucks at 2am, or drunken assholes stumbling out of Liquor Lyle's calling out to their equally drunken friends.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  Stressful as all get-out.  It's the worst thing in the world to do.  I'd rather have someone drop kick me in the ball bag than move my stuff every other year or so.   4. What's more important, location or price?  I concur with my friend, Panda.  Location baby.  Unfortunately some of my locations have been less than stellar.  Hence the moves.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  I'd love to have a big old office/library where I could work on my latest literary masterpiece.  Attached to that, I'd like a nice big dark room so I can pretend that I'm a big shot photographer too.  A pool would be okay, too, but more importantly I'd like to have a big old spa attached to my kickboxing gym where I'd have heavy bags, speed bags, lots of kicking shields and a full-size ring where I could have my very own fight club.  Oooohh...I'd also like to have a video game arcade where I could have all of the classic vids that I enjoyed growing up.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the deluxe stadium-seating home theatre, too.  Perfect for watching my asspocket of DVDs and playing video games until my eyes were as dry as chicken tenders from Arby's.  Yeah, I said it.          "
"            I like this Friday 5, so let's do it    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Hmmmm....the white house in Madison, the brown house in Madison, the yellow house in Appleton, the brick house in Appleton, the dorms in St. Paul, Crouch End flat in London, 87 Cleveland in St. Paul, Cle-Mar in St. Paul, 3 BR Three's Company situation in Uptown, St. Louis Park place, studio on Lake Shore Dr. in Chi-town.  That would be 11.   2. Which was your favorite and why?  Crouch End flat for obvious reasons...some of my best times EVER were in London (and Stoner was there, she can vouch for me!)...even though those damn kids would wake me up practicing their violins.  87 Cleveland (w/ AM and Jillios) ranks up there too - ask Hal about cleaning the floors.    3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  The most stressful experience I can think of.  That's why I haven't moved out of my tiny place in over 4 years, even though I constantly complain about its size.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Location, location, location.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  My dream house would have a pool, but only if I was in California, NOT the Midwest.  In Chicago you could only use a pool for about a month.  Oh, and I would need a cute pool boy to clean it.  I would also like a home gym, but only if Rico (that Fubu wearing hottie) was my personal trainer.  Sorry, TG.          "

"           Geez....someone's crabby.  (see post below)  But seriously, HAL, when is a good time to schedule you to meet my cat?  I'm sure Kato's owners are flexible as to when people can come by to see how un-cat-like the little fellow is.  After all, he is America's Favorite Cat. Did I mention that he's got a crooked tail?  It's so adorable...there's no doubt in my mind that you'll stop hating cats.  I guarantee it, friend.  And oh...that reminds me, I've got to stop at Sam's Club for a 2 pound bag of Chex Mix.  Nummers!  That aside, I feel it's my civic duty to report I've found my CD of the year.  Yes, it's only April and early April at that, but I don't care.  I think I've found the next album that's going to remain in the truck for basically the rest of my days.  It's  urlLink The Exies .  They opened for Everclear last night at First Avenue (rollicking, sweaty good time) and I've got to say these fellows rock like none other.  The best part?  Their CD is only  $7.99 at Target this week .  I scooped it up on Tuesday so I'd be prepared for last night's show when Duf and I went out to score the latest White Stripes CD and I've got to admit...DJS likey more than the WS disc.  I never thought I'd admit it, but it's THAT GOOD.  If you're in the office (Duf, HAL) you must stop by to watch the video that's included on the CD.  Just damn good all around.  Side note: Barrio Barb bought it on my recommendation and CK2 is going to scoop up a copy, citing:  'The lead singer is HOT.'          "
"            Morning Rant   DJS, Im sure its a great cat.  But why are cat people so defensive?  If someone says I like cats better than dogs they dont get a response like you have to meet MY dog hes great, and totally unlike all other dogs.  Hes more of a turtle, really.  Whereas every time I say I dont dig cats, someone has The Exception Pet that I would surely love.  I dont get it.  Something else I dont get  there is a new Sams Club opening in Bloomington on 494 any day now.  I know this because my parents have brought it up at least once every time Ive spoken with them recently.  Im like, what is your obsession with Sams Club? and my mother went on about how its near a Home Depot, and much more convenient than St. Louis Park.  Didnt answer my question, but I guess its a response.  I just dont understand why any two-person household needs to buy in bulk.  Its not like theyre caterers!  Anyway, today my dad brought it up AGAIN (!!!), and I said does mother know that Wal-Mart is not allowing their employees to unionize?  His response was silence, and then, your mother is not a liberal.  No, shes not.  But at least shes got an 18-month supply of corn flakes.         "
"            When you go to the zoo, what animal are you most excited to see? Why?  Ugh...the zoo.  I'm not a big fan of the zoo.  In my opinion all of the animals look tremendously sad and I feel bad for going and looking at them.  Before anyone jumps on me and says  'Jesus, you crumudgeon (sp?) lighten up!  The Minnesota Zoo is great for the animals.  They totally feel like they're right at home in their cages/pens/whatever!'   No they don't.  Seriously, take a survey and see which ones like living a confined life and which ones would like the get their ass outta Minnesota.  That being said, I guess I'll have to go with the tigers.  Just seeing the look they give the people who bang on the windows of their cage.  It's like:  'I could soooo eat you if I was out there.'     Come on now, cats or dogs? Why? (Yes, Hal, you have to pick one)...  I'm going to plead the 5th on this one.  For my living situation, I have no choice but to like dogs better (DJ LZ is allergic), but I had the greatest cat in the world before she came along, so I feel I'd be betraying his species if I didn't say I had a soft spot for cats as well.  Ah Kato...I hardly knew ye.  I gave him to a good home and he's happy where he's at.  If I had my cat still, I'd invite all of y'all to take the Pepsi Challenge with Kato.  He was a cat who didn't know he was a cat.  Affectionate, would fetch stuff and did this cute little dance whenever I came home.     Okay...that's enough.  I miss my lil' buddy.         "

"            An April Fools Joke on Mrs. Duf Fer  By Duf Fer  Background:  J is my mother in law.  R is my brother in law and our financial advisor.  About 5 months ago, I tried to make a case for buying United Airlines stock.  Mrs. Duf Fer was reluctant and so was R.  This is the message I sent Mrs. Duf Fer about 5 minutes ago:   This morning, I was reading that philosophy book that J gave me and happened upon a quote that really made a lot to sense to me.  Keep the quote in mind as you read this e-mail:  A person really is less free once one learns servitude.    - Goethe  I have been thinking a lot about our financial futureand here goes    This morning, I called your brother to talk about college basketball.  We got to talking about United airlines, and I asked him to purchase 4,000 shares of United Airline stock for us.  He agreed to do it, and the purchase will be made probably by 11:45 this morning (he was preparing some other buy tickets and thought he could have it done by then).    R was not too in favor of this purchase (Merrill analysts are saying short term is sell and long term is sell, but I really have a lot of confidence about this, and you know how conservative money managers are about the airline industry  Warren Buffet wont touch it).  Im sure you remember that United was trading at about $2.50 a couple of months ago when I originally had the idea. Today it is trading at 81 cents (so maybe you were right that we should not have bought it then).  Anyway, it is obvious that now is the time to buy.    The federal government has indicated that it might loan airlines some money so I think thats a good sign.  Also, even though the United machinists union refuses to re-negotiate salary, Im sure they will resolve with massive layoffs (like Northwest just did).  There are indications that United will embrace this strategy to get the costs savings they so desperately need.  Remember, United is the number two airline in America (in terms of routes) with key routes in the central transportation infrastructure and the OHare hub (which is a jewel).  Also, United is the official airline of the Oprah Winfrey show.  So, lets look at the upside here.  Pre- September 11th, United was trading at about 30 dollars a share.  To be conservative, lets assume it will go back to half that amount to $15 per share.  That means our investment today of about $3200 will turn into $60,000 for a profit of about $56,800.  Imagine what happens if it returns to $30 per share (which Im sure it will).  We will end our financial servitude and know true freedom (focus on the Goethe quote; I think the answer is there).  Yes, there is a risk, but whats $3,200 to us  its just sitting there mocking us  begging to be spent.  Dont you think buying the stock is a better idea than buying a new sofa (given the potential return)?  Also, if you look at our portfolio, we dont have any risky stuff.  We have overloaded on conservative investments, so this risk gives us better balance.    I think the part that may bug you most about this is not talking about it first.  Okay, I can explain that.  I feel so good about this decision that I just knew you would say yes anyway.  Also, when we talked about it before, you kind of said yes, so I felt comfortable giving the go ahead.     If this all blows up (which it wont), I will give up half my allowance until the loss is returned to us with interest.  If you really dont want to do this, call me by 11:45, and I will try to cancel with R.  Love,  Duf'  P.S.  Focus on the first letter in each word of the quote.  I think it's a code of some kind.         "
"            Stoners Review of Omnifest.    My sweetie and I have officially gone to half of the movies at this years Omnifest at the Science Museum. (I feel so cultured.) Weve seen Adrenaline Rush: The Science of Risk, Ocean Men: Extreme Dive, and The Great Barrier Reef. I was most excited for the last one  but unfortunately, I think it was filmed in the late seventies/early eighties. People actually laughed out loud. The narrators voice was very familiar  I remember it well from documentaries in eighth-grade science class. And it was extremely dramatic. Throughout, there were interviews with a couple who looove the ocean, and call the Great Barrier Reef their second home. Theyre very concerned about the damage that humans are doing (as they pull themselves along on the coral and step on it) and have befriended many fish (which they pet  these are fish  they have no fur). My sweetie and I agreed, most of the aquatic life around them looked terrified. My favorite quote of the movie came when the woman (who looks and sounds just like Olivia Newton-John) picked up a sleeping fish. As it started to wake up and freak out, she shoved it back into its sponge-y hiding place. In this very surreal, sweet voice she said see  you can pick up the fish and they hardly notice. This one is starting to stir a bit. Perhaps when it wakes up, it will think this was all just some horrible nightmare. (Insert sweet, Glinda-the-good-witch smile here.) Yes, she must really love those fish.  Whoa. That was quite the long post. Im impressed with myself.   Must...rest...now...          "
"            Rant   So I'm sitting here on a Friday night posting to a blog...God, I'm a rock star. Anyhoo, I've got a few things on my mind and I often stop to think and reflect about the things that I have seen, experienced and hope for the future. I've always been a 'heavy thinker' so much so that my mom told me when I was young that one day I might grow up to have an ulcer. (All right! Something to look forward to!) I had a very 'heavy thinking' week this past week. I get bogged down with people's expectations of me, my expectations of others, and my fears and insecurities. I've realized that this isn't a good time. I don't want to think about those things so much anymore. This is easier said than done, but I'm trying. Take a deep breath, trust in God and just let it go.   Sorry to get a little heavy on you, but I feel better. Thanks.  And on to the F5:  1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I think being a kind, loyal soul would be nice. Oh and the effing hot chic bass playah this town has evah seen...rock.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   At this moment: don't worry, be happy.    3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Moving past bad relationship moments and finding joy in loving someone.    4. What about the past ten years?   Oof...there are a lot of big and small victories over the past 10 years, can't point out just one. I would say the most meaningful moments have come from relationships - finding love, enduring love, losing love and starting all over again. It's humbling and empowering in the same minute.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   Don't be afraid to jump in with both feet. Oh and if you aren't a rock star, you're nobody. rock on.           "
"            My movie comments and 5 -    Right on, Panda,  Keeping the Faith  is one of my (not so) guilty pleasure movies.  It's no masterpiece, but I really loved it.  It totally lacks cynicism, and I think that's why it stands out.  I also saw  Rules of Attraction  not so long ago... I thought it completely sucked.  Sorry, but Dawson on the crapper does not equal art.  I read the book (for some reason I am repelled and yet strangly attracted to BEE's books, but that's another post for another time) and it wasn't much better.  Last night I  urlLink watched this  and found it to be excellent.  It has been so raved about in the press that I was ready for a big let down.  Go see it.  Claire Danes is BACK!  Also, a few nights ago I watched a couple of episodes from season four of  urlLink Sex and the City .  It was a lot of the same (Big or Aidan, Aiden or Big, etc.), but there was one episode that was beyond great - Miranda's mom suddenly died, and the three other girls go to Philly for the funeral.  I was blown away by how good it was (and I cried like a baby...).  It said more about not only female friendship, but how we deal with grief than anything I've seen before.  That show is a good one.  On to the q's...   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   You mean I get to pick?  Alright  remember that Im kind and funny.  Make that very kind and very funny.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   It is what it is   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   About 9 months ago I was part of a work shake up that felt like a very big deal at the time, and now seems like so little so long ago.  I learned a lot from the entire experience (I still am, really), and that feels good.   4. What about the past ten years?   In the last ten years I have graduated from both high school and college, and done all those other things that one typically does from the age of 17 to 27.  They are pretty meaty years as far as personal growth and achievement cant pick out a small list from that.  But suffice it to say  Im happy with where Im at.    5.

"            The Heavy Five and that Ain't No Jive [with closed circuit comments to PB]  By Fer, Duf   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   Being a nice person and the father of the first person to land on Mars or cure cancer or both (like cure cancer with cancer-fighting gel discovered while exploring Mars).   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   [PB, I loved your quote.  My grandmother used to say 'in order to really clean up, you have to make a mess.']  But the quote that best fits my outlook is '...isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?'  Because, to me, it speaks to the need to find happiness in the real world and the everyday and in the bonds we all have with others, be they friends or lovers.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Nearing full implementation with a challenging project at work.  Close second:  last year around this time, I got an eagle on a long par five (three wood, four iron and 15 foot putt).   4. What about the past ten years?   No question:  becoming a father.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  [PB, not to get all heavy on you, but I think it is impossible to have a relationship of consequence/depth and not make someone cry. Could we add the words 'ever mean to' in front of 'make you cry'?].  My advice:  'always make the decisions that make you happy, that limit hurt to others and that give you the most options; if you pursue nothing else, pursue happiness, but don't do so selfishly.'  Close second:  'stay sucka free, baby.'  SSH (sorry so heavy), Duf'         "
"            It's Been a Movie Marathon   I've watched a ridiculous number of movies this week.  Let me separate the good from the bad for you, in case you find yourself in the video store this weekend and don't know what to rent:   urlLink  Secretary  : liked it a lot.  I actually cried a bit at the end even though it was a creepy S&M type love story.  But I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable.   urlLink  Slackers  : good, but not that memorable.  I rented it because of my love for Jason Schwartzman.  He plays a very convincing stalker.   urlLink  Vulgar  : disturbing on so many levels.  Being a Viewaskew production from Kevin Smith, I had high hopes for this film.  Especially with Brian O'Hallaran (Dante from Clerks) as the wacko clown.  If it wasn't for the cameos from Kevin Smith (as a gay TV producer - really funny!) and Jason Mewes (as his slacker-self), I would have turned this off after the first 15 minutes.   urlLink  Pecker  : my favorite of the rentals.  Funny and quirky.  Memama's (the crazy grandma) obsessive idolatry put me over the edge.  She made a Virgin Mary statue talk, using her own voice ('Full of Grace!  Full of Grace!'), and claimed it as a  miracle .  I think even my mom would laugh at that one.   urlLink  Blue Car  : good, but depressing.  Saw this in the theater...I'd call it 'Lolita-lite'.   urlLink  Keeping the Faith  : I was surprisingly delighted by this.  Edward Norton and Ben Stiller make a great combo.  My favorite scene was when Edward Norton's character set himself on fire when using the insense-thingy in church.     urlLink  Rules of Attraction  : funny to see the usually squeaky-clean WB actors turn towards the dark side.  Unsettling, but oddly intriguing.  These kids take debauchery to a whole other level.  Dawson Leary as a drug dealer?  F-ing great.         "
"            Too heavy for Pandyland?  What the hell...   The Insomniac's Friday Five  by Panda   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I would like to be remembered as a risk taker who always loved bravely, laughed loudly, and lived without regrets.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   I remember my grandfather once saying, You have to plan for the good times, because the bad make their own arrangements.  When you have things to look forward to, life cant get any sweeter.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   There are 2: getting my MBA and walking away from a wedding/marriage that was bound to make me miserable.   4. What about the past ten years?   With each year, comes less guilt about not meeting my parents expectations of me.  This has been a long process, but I am finally starting to figure out what I want out of life, without looking for the acceptance of the people around me.  Sometimes its not easy being an over-achieving, people-pleasing, Catholic girl.  And on a side note: when thinking about all the crazy shit Ive done in the last 10 years, Im just glad Im still  alive .   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  In general, you should always listen to your gut instinct.  99% of the time, its right.  To all the girls out there: No man is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.          "

"           Hal, that's funny you bring up that important topic.  T and I went to my  urlLink new favorite neighborhood bar  last Saturday.  Since I had spent the whole day on a boat, steadily drinking, I vowed to T that I would only have a salad and Diet Coke and we would just 'hang out.'  I did order my salad and DC, and we were just hanging out, until some guys came over to talk with us, one of them strikingly resembling Prince William. (Of course, I had to tell him that fact.  At first he thought I was talking about Prince Charles...'No!  The hot son of the late Princess Diana, you fool!')    All of a sudden I had the urge to order a round of shots for everyone.  Must be something about royalty and alcohol.  It's like a drug for me.    The night only got messy after this.  We ended up stopping by a sex shop, and we learned the lesson that it's illegal for women to go to 'the back of the store' - where the peep shows are.  For some reason, that seems ass-backwards to me.  Then, when we got to Monsignor Murphy's, one of the guys we were with decides to perform his own  urlLink 'Puppetry of the Penis'  (the ancient art of genital origami) show for a bunch of 40-something women.  Nothing like mixing tequila with penis tricks.  And his fiance thought it was a riot.  Hal, you have to move to Chicago, if only for the stories.  But to answer your question, I'm a Wills Girl...or at least A Guy Resembling Wills Girl.          "

"            To The Strength...To Go The Length, Thinking You Are First When You Really Are Tenth?     1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I like going to the ocean.  I know that's pretty general, but it's true.  I don't care if I'm in Oregon, Ca-li-for-ni-a, or even on the east coast, seeing that much water crashing into the delicious land does something for me.  But, if I were to make a full-on decision, I guess I'd say I like seeing the ocean from the Santa Monica pier.  I've been there a bunch of times and I find it pretty difficult to turn around and go back where I came from.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not very well-traveled...yet.   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)   I remember going to California when we were kids and believe it or not, the trip to the actual state aboard the plane went without a hitch.  It was when we landed and tried to find (in my dad's words) the 'son of a bitchin' hotel.'  I kid you negative when I say we spent a good 2.5 hours in the car, exhausted from the flight, listening to my dad go apeshit in the front seat while he told Mama Shovelpants 'he knew where he was going, goddammit.'  Other than that, I've got nothing horrible to report...at least to that destination.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)   I've got a few.  Philidelphia - I took a roadtrip with a previous girlfriend and we made all of our hotel arrangements over the phone.  I never understood how this was done because you never really know what kind of place you're getting yourself into.  So, we were going to Philly to see Madonna on her last tour and we booked a room in a hotel that was like 3 stars or something.  Not bad, right?  Wrong.  When we got there, the place was being totally renovated...and not for the better of the hotel.  The swimming pool (which it announced online as being open and beautiful) hadn't had any water in it since 1973.  The elevator up to the room looked like it had been shot up with bullets and beaten with a sledgehammer.  It creaked and farted as we went up to the 10th floor.  I thought, 'Well...at least our room will be okay.'  Right?  Wrong again, suckerhead.  I am not even kidding when I say it looked like there had been a homicide in our room.  There were unidentifiable stains on the carpet, a real mildewy smell to the place, ratty bedspreads, shitty artwork from a dying/starving artists sale, and a view of the 'hood.'  For a couple of very white-bread 20-somethings, this wasn't good.  The kicker was that I had driven straight through from Minnecrapolis to this shithole with about an 1.5 hours of sleep.  This was supposed to be my oasis...my pot o' gold at the end of the interstate rainbow.  'Twas not to be.  I looked the place over and was horrified at what I saw.  Old chips and shit under the bed intermingled with dust-bunnies.  Behind one of the pieces of art, I noticed some maroon-colored splatter marks.  I've read a lot of true crime books, kids...I know what that is.  Blood.  From the looks of it, someone blew their brains out all over the wall and the cleaning staff must've given it a quick wipe with a Wet-0ne.  Needless to say, we got the hell out of Dodge and found a nicer, more expensive hotel.  We even got free cookies.  The second one was when I helped my friend Jay move to Orlando, Florida.  Not only did I get a $212.00 speeding ticket in Sconie (oooh, I hate that) but once we got into Florida, we got in possibly the worst (and almost deadly) accident ever.  In the left lane, some ass-clown hit (and killed) a dog.  He slammed on his brakes and came to a complete stop.  As such, the cars behind him (us included) we screwed.  To Jay's credit, he swerved out of the left lane and saved us from a nasty rear-end collision.  The bad part is, we clipped a minivan which sent us spinning across 4 lanes of busy Florida traffic.  Let me repeat that.  We SPUN across 4 lanes of traffic.  At one point, I could see the cars coming down the freeway directly at us as we spun off and landed ass-backwards in the ditch.  Neither of us was hurt and amazingly, no one else, save the dog, was killed.  No doubt about it, it sucked.  The thing that made me most mad was that the asshole who started the 7-8 car pileup drove off before the cops came.  Some people...         "
"           Yeah, I don't really agree with Maddox's review at all.  I thought some of the crap he said was pretty funny, but all in all there really wasn't any basis in his qualms with the movie.  But yeah...no one needed to see Keanu's ass.  That's just irresponsible.         "
"           DJS, I can't imagine you would agree with  urlLink this .  Except maybe the Keanu part.         "
"            1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  When I havent been home in awhile, I love landing at the Minneapolis airport and feeling like Im home again, or if traveling by car, exiting from the freeway and being almost there.  Sometimes its more exciting than leaving in the first place.   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)  Im probably jinxing myself, but I have incredible good luck in travel.  The glaring exception was on a commuter train one night in London.  Because of a problem with the tracks earlier in the day, the Thameslink train we used to get from central London to our burb was unbelievably packed, even at 11:30pm on a weeknight.  The platform was jammed, and when the second-to-last train came up, it was chaos trying to get on.  None of the four of us could fight our way onto it.  When we realized that the last train was on its way, we were ready to kill or maim our way onto it, as the alternative was waiting at the cold station until the first train at 4:30am.  We risked massive internal injuries, shoved past even the most jaded Londoners, and barely squeezed onto the train.  It was a claustrophobics worst nightmare  flying through underground tunnels in an over-packed train car.  Once on, the four of us shared looks of great relief, even if we could hardly breathe  the ride from Kings Cross to our stop was just 17 minutes total, including a handful on stops in between.  We figured the worst was over  we were on the train, and the crowded situation could only improve with each stop as people got off.  Unfortunately, things got much worse before the first stop.  Some guy a couple feet away from me had enjoyed too much red wine (from the look and smell of it) and started puking.  Some lady cried out, OH, GOD! and then there was massive groaning, and then I remember the stench hitting me.  Horrible.  One of my companions, Mikey, was closer to the action and he looked as though he was going to die.  Somehow in that impossibly tight space, the drunk puker was given his own open space.  I still dont know how this was physically possible.  People must have crawled onto each others shoulders.  Eww.  It was the worst 15 minutes of travel Ive ever experienced.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  Again, Ive been pretty lucky.  The worst places Ive stayed have been some lower-end youth hostels (others were not too bad), and while they were not nightmares, I remember showering in a gross hostel in Rome and realizing that I was somehow getting dirtier.  On that same trip we were accosted a few times in various cities by little gypsy girls.  It was totally sad  they were obviously well trained at a young age.  And no matter how mean these kids were, you just cant up a smack a little girl.  Which is probably why they clean up as thieves (or at least they did with us).          "
"            1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?   Thailand.  Why?  The people are some of the friendliest on earth, the food kicks you in the ass (in a good way - spicy!), there are mountains  and  beaches, everything is dirt cheap - from hotels and food to fake Burberry purses, and the great live sex shows.  (Just kidding about that last one...although, according to the 'menus' I was presented with, you'd be surprised what those women can do - pussy shoot banana anyone?)   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)   Oh my God.  Until recently, y'all know I've been traveling at least 50% of the time for my job...that ups the odds that  something  horrible could go wrong.  The first winter I traveled for this job, my plane was late (coming AND going)  every single time .  One time, they brought us out on the tarmac (this was, of course, to keep the stat of 'on time departure').  We then sat on the runway for 3-1/2 hours.  They only gave us water.  People were irate.  It was anarchy.  We ended up not even taking off and drove back to the gate.  The flight was delayed until the next morning and there were no hotels available.  Absolute nightmare.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)   9/11.  Saw the second building get hit and the horror in people's faces.  We couldnt fly, so I roadtripped back to Chicago with 2 guys (a 50-year-old flaming homosexual and a chain-smoking Columbian) I didnt know from our LA office and we slept in the same hotel room together (the only one left) in Toledo, OH.  Enough said.          "
"            1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I would say Alaska.  I like that there are different rules there (the shortest distance between two points may not be a straight line; you can golf at midnight sometimes), and I love that everything there is so big, so grand and so unspoiled.  I have only been once, but I would like to go back.  I not a big repeat traveler, and I would like to go to so many other places, but it is difficult for me to imagine a time when Alaska does not hold a special place in my heart.    2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)  Not really except that I learned the hard way that the shortest distance between two points in not necessarily a straight line.  When the 'highway' I took originally was jam packed with potholes that you could sink a basketball in (no, I'm not kidding).    3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  One, I got pick-pocketed in Chicago.  I called the police, and they were all like 'what do you want us to do?'  When I got back to Kansas my wallet was in the mail (with all of it's credit cards and none of its cash) with a nice note saying 'I saw a man throw this in a trash can and thought you might like it back.  Happy New Year!'          "

I'm seeing Old School at the Vic tonight after dinner (again, more training), will possibly be on a boat on Saturday if the weather cooperates (this is when the training is brought up another notch - the 'long run', if you will), Girls' Night on Saturday (sprint training), the Sox game on Sunday  afternoon at Comisky (slow & steady training starting at 1:05pm), and my day off on Monday (maybe catch an indy film).

"            No Friday Love   What's up with the no posts today? Are you guys actually working? Here's a Fun Friday 3 to get you a-postin...  1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  Las Vegas is one. I just love staying in fun hotels with lots of amenities and things to do. Vegas has TONS of them, so I've always stayed in a new hotel each visit and each one so far has been distinct, from the kitsch-y, cheap Imperial Palace to the luxury of the Mirage. Another favorite destination is Hawaii. Now I've only been there once (just a few months ago!), but I can definitely see myself continually going back. It's gorgeous and relaxing, but save your pennies...   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, ridiing bus, etc.)  I've been pretty lucky with travel services so far in my life, but during one Christmas vacation a few years ago I was driving to see my boyfriend who lived in Chicago. I decided to drive from Mpls by myself. Unfortunately, a snow storm started on the day I left and it was awful. Normally, an easy drive down I-94 averaging about 75 mph and getting there in about 6 hours, was turned into a drive down Hell's Alley. Ok, maybe that's a tad dramatic but it's pretty hard to drive 40 mph, by yourself, gripping the steering wheel tensely the entire way, and no more than half mile visibility in front of you while passing cars and trucks turned over on both sides of the road. It took me 12 hours to arrive in chicago. oi.    3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  When I was in college, I took the typical 'Spring Break 95!' trip to a sunny Mexico destination. The hotel was a hot bed of college co-eds, unfortunately the hotel pool was an indication of how hot the hot bed was. GROSS. yick. ew.              "
"            1) Tell me about your neighbors.   We live on the end of a string of four townhouses, so there's only a neighbor on one side.  I don't think the two women who live there, like us all that much.  Here's my theory:  On Monday nights a group of my friends (okay, two) come over and we play video games.  DJ LZ heads upstairs to the safety of our bedroom while we hash out our battles, quests, typical video game nerd shit.  During the course of the evening, I've been known to holler: 'You whore!  Son of a bitch!  Oh you piece of shit!  F--- You!, etc.'  You get the picture.  Sometimes, I slam my hand down on the couch in frustration and I groan like the world is ending.  I think they might think that the Soon-To-Be-Mrs. Shovelpants and I are in an abusive relationship.  It probably didn't help that I would kickbox out in the garage either.  The only other neighbors I'm aware of is the guy who has so much crap piled up in his garage that he literally has a narrow corridor that leads to his back door.  He walks his dog to the mailbox, where it pisses all over the side of the box.  He doesn't want to damage his yard, you know!  Then there's the guy who puts on his Rollerblades to skate to the mailbox to get his mail, then rolls on back.  At least he says 'hi.'   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Best - The weather.  (sun, warmth, etc.) Least - The weather.  (rain, gloom, filth, etc.)   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).   That's easy...in lieu of Salma Hayek, I prefer a mate of the female variety who has big striking blue eyes, a smile that almost makes you want to cry because she makes you so happy.  One with rotten taste in music and movies.  I find that so damn cute!  My mate would be from Mankato, have one brother, one sister, drink watery Michelob Golden Draft Light, pronounce 'hot dogs' funny, steal all my good lines, 'set' puzzles instead of 'put them together', have every line of 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' memorized, and would be a whiz with budgeting and keeping my shit in check.

"            Thursday 3 in the hizzause...My first questionnaire!   1) Tell me about your neighbors.  I have neighbors on one side of my apartment. I'm on a corner unit. And they seem like nice folks except for the loud music at very early hours. They also have a friend that lives in the building who comes by their apt. to visit quite often and rings the doorbell whenever she stops by. It's kinda like a dorm for them...ahh dorm life *nostalgia surge* the days when you could stumble 'home' after a drunken adventure by simply following the hallway walls.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.  Most favorite: I have to agree with Panda. I love the smell in the air -- lilacs especially. And it's the season before my favorite, Summer. What can I say? I like it hot.  Least favorite: my work building turns on the air conditioning in spring, so it's not only sometimes cold outside, it's freezing inside all the time. I hate it. My fingers are losing mobility as I type...this...now.   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).   I'm a sucker for musicians, big time. The creativity, passion, focus, and drive are all highly attractive qualities for me. Actually it doesn't necessarily have to be music. A spark for something creative is a turn-on. Something that puts a 'fire under his butt' (Credit: Christine) I also like it when he turns that passion into a life-goal and makes it a priority to perform. It's such a treat to watch someone perform well. Other qualities include being a warm personality, genuinely nice person and organized. A good conversationalist and a down-to-earth guy who's interested in my mind  and  body. ; )          "
"            What do they do with the stuff that they cut/pump out?  BB, thanks for bringing up 'Extreme Makeover'  I guess someone had too.  I actually like the show as well although I have to look away whenever they show a nose job being performed - its just too much to see them hammer and slice away.  I also agree that its well done considering that when you boil it all down, the message of the show is that if you just looked better, you will be happier.  But you know what?  The fact of life is that these people are going to be treated differently by the world as 'afters' then they were treated as 'befores'.  Im not against plastic surgery (unless youre Phyllis Diller) and Im certainly not against reality TV.  So why not 'Extreme Makeover'?  On to the serious business   1) Tell me about your neighbors.  Well, theres not much to say  the weirdoes across the hall got evicted, and there were the only neighbors that were really on my radar.  I guess that makes me a bad person  I need to reach out to the many others on the second floor.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.  Best, the longer days.  Least, that road construction is just beginning   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).  Oh, dear.  Faithful readers may remember that I couldnt describe my dream house and I dont think I could do any better with describing my dream guy.  Suffice it to say, I know when I see what I like.  Take, for instance,  urlLink Michael Vartan ... just a random example, of course.          "
"            1) Tell me about your neighbors.   Our neighbors are Henry and Carlotta.  They are retired.  They are very, very nice.  They drink a lot. They are pack rats, but they are very, very nice.  There has been a racoon stalking around our neighborhood.  Two nights ago, Henry shot her with a .22.  Can I get an Atticus Finch casting call one time?  Our neighbors to the West...not much to say except I have never (as in not once) seen them open their curtains.  Once they brought over mail that was delivered to them inadvertently, so if they are chopping people up in there, I would tell the TV news 'I'm shocked..they seemed so nice...they kept to themselves and always mowed their lawn in a timely fashion.'   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Most: It is the beginning of golf season.  For me, that is the best part by far.  I also like the baby animals that are around, the return of flowers, and the fragrance of lilacs in the air.  But don't kid yourself, it's 98% golf.    Least:  It ends with summer, when it is too darn hot (can I get some AC up in this mug?).   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).   I can fantasize here, huh?  Easy for you to say!  Let me just say I like the maternal type, gardeners get extra points, a woman who will golf with me and tolerate my foolishness and sloth.  I favor girls from small college towns who have strong local family ties and a fiscally conservative bent.  They should be about 5 feet 8 inches tall an laugh at my jokes (selectively).

"            I'm a Junkie   I can't get enough. I'm addicted. I'm hooked. I need my...Reality TV. Last night I spent 2 hours happily flipping through American Idol, The Bachelor and Extreme Makeover. And I was depressed when it was all over and it was time to go to bed. I'm pathetic but I'm enjoying these shows so I don't care if you think I'm pathetic. The world is a harsh place and find happiness where you can is my motto. (I have a motto now!?)  American Idol was interesting for the last 15 minutes when they cut the crap and announced the winner. But I must disagree with Panda in that Clay did not get robbed. He clearly is a talented singer and I think he would be perfect for Broadway and theater. But he always reminds me of the kid from MAD Magazine when I look at him, with a delivery that was a bit too dramatic for me. I was happy when Ruben took the title as I enjoyed hearing him sing in every performance.   The Bachelor was good. I won't bore you with the deets. It's been my guilty pleasure this spring. Don't hate.  And finally, the most enjoyable hour is Extreme Makeover. Have any of you seen this show?? It's awesome. They take real people who have been unhappy with their body, bone structure, teeth, hair, makeup, everything and make them over. Now you must be wondering 'Why would Bass Babe like such a superficial show, promoting looks over personality?' Why? I'll tell you. The people chosen are normal, everyday people, not rich, snobby types who need to look younger for their television careers (Joan Rivers, a perfect example of hideousness.) The people chosen are folks you would know in your neighborhood who have some serious problems and have dealt with ridicule & shame their entire lives. Now you can say 'Hey who cares what people think! Be happy with what God gave you!' that may be true in an ideal world, but c'mon we've all felt uncomfortable with our looks at some point and these people feel uncomfortable ALL the time. They can get anything they want if chosen for this show: plastic surgery, lipo, dental work, Lasik, personal trainer sessions, fashion, hair and makeup consultants. and it's amazing the transformations. They are so happy that it kinda makes you get a little teary. And in the updates of previous winners at the end of the show, all are still so happy and have made real efforts in changing their attitudes and confidence. it's pretty cool. So I ask you fellow Pandylandaz, would you ever consider changing your looks (body and/or face) in the Extreme?  Me: If I were chosen and I didn't have to pay anything, I  might   get my nose worked on, as I've never been real happy with my fleshy button nose. I'd also get my teeth straightened and whitened. I'd like the fashion, makeup and hair too.   sorry for the long post.  BB           "
"            I Think I'm Going to Hyperventilate   I just found out tickets go on sale on June 7th for the Ben Folds/Tori Amos show here in Chicago on Sunday, August 10th.  Never in a million years would I have put these 2 on the same stage, but I suppose it makes sense since they both play piano.  OK, I gotta go breathe into a paper bag or something.

"            This Damn Insomnia Strikes Again:  Tell Me - The Thursday Three  by Panda   1) Tell me about your neighbors.   Ive had many neighbors throughout my years here on Lake Shore Dr.  There used to be a guy next to me I called coughing guy who sounded like he was coughing up a lung throughout the night.  Right now, the guy who lives next to me I call LP Trixie guy because he always has some dumb broad(s) over whose voice wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Like, do you remember that scene in Happy Days, where  No lie, I just heard the Trixie say this and it sounded as if she was actually in my apartment  it was that audible.  He also has a lot of sex with these chicks.  Thats the last thing I need to hear right now.  Then, of course, who could forget bald, gay, drug-dealing Bill who used to live across the hall from me.  The clowns who live there now share something with Bill  they just got an eviction notice taped to their door a couple days ago.  Good riddance; their Rottweiler-sized dog scares the crap out of me.  Then theres bird guy down the hall whose bird is always squawking when Im waiting for the elevator.  Old Guy, on the other side, has lived here even longer than I have.  We both are early-risers and often make small talk in the elevator about the weather.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Best = The smell in the air.  Its glorious.  And I love the first pedicure of the seasonthats when you can truly say good-bye to old man winter.  Least = The fashion confusion.  I never know when I can officially start wearing Capri pants and sandals and am not allowed to wear wool sweaters anymore.  On the really weird weather days Ill pair wool pants and flip flops together.  Im a mess.   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).   First things first: hes gotta have a quick wit and make me laugh hysterically.  The rest is just frosting on the cake.  Spontaneity is important considering my uber-planning ways; it helps even me out.  Theres nothing sexier than a guy who can take a last minute trip or spontaneous sick day with me.  Having a lot of the same musical tastes always helps.  He would also send me flowers at work (or maybe meet me for lunch with a single dendrobium orchid).  Having been very close to getting married, I know having the same life goals really goes a long way as well.  I usually go for guys who are a little awkward, but not in a hes a project sort of way.  More in an endearing wayhis pants might be a little too big, or he wears Chuck Taylors with shorts, or he may have goofy sideburns, or he may trip when he goes to open the door for me.  I definitely do not like slicksters.  You know, the guys who are so smooth and know all the ways to woo a woman into the sack.  These guys make me really uncomfortable and I can smell them a mile away.  I also dont fall for money (although it can be fun for a while).  Stability and security is important, but all that 'stuff' is just temporary.  What would you do if he lost his job and it was just you, him, and an empty room?  He better be able to entertain me with nothing.  Thats what I want: to be able to be in an empty room with him, with no distractions, and have everything I need.           "

"            The Profundity of Parenthood  By Duf Fer  TinyE, the pride and joy of Duf and Mrs. Duf, has entered a new phase.  She loves music.  Loves it!  But friends, she does not love the same music as Duf yet (she turns her nose up to Radiohead.  Radiohead!  Young people today...but I digress).  She loves children's music (and lots of it).  It can be pretty cool.  For example, Putamayo has a collection that plays like the best cartoons - it works on a level that kids really respond to, and there is substance for the adult audience too.  But, sadly, children's music (like children's lit) can also be lousy and horrible like Chinese water torture (drip, drip).  For example, Mother Duf (TinyE's grandmama) bought TinyE a collection of songs, rounds and spirituals including such classics as 'Clementine' (I could little describe the extent of it awfulness)and 'Are You Sleeping Brother John' and 'Shanandoah' (which I must confess is a Duf' favorite - both on the disc and otherwise).  The problem with the collection from Mother Duf is that it has 61 songs on it (not a typo, that's 61 - under the 'O', six, one), and it is like nicotine for the toddler set.  Once they start on it, there is the initial coughing fit and burning sensation and then they're hooked.  Here is a sample of one song:  Go-d said 'Noah There's going to be a floody, floody' Go-d said 'Noah There's going to be a floody, floody Get Those Chil- dren [clap] Out of the muddy, muddy... Children  uh-of the Luh-ord!'  And it's exactly like a song that a co-worker whistles or hums or sings that gets stuck in your head all day.  ALL DAY!'  From the Putamayo collection though, there is a really great song called 'Just Keep Goin' On.'  It is sung by a Blues artist named Eric Bibb. It has a verse I like quite a lot:  Just keep goin' on Just keep goin' on Just keep goin' ah-on Just keep goin' on Treat every knock as a boost and every stumblin' block as a steppin' stone Lift up your head Hold your own Just keep goin' on  That's what's in my head today.  Call me, I'll sing a verse.         "

Breakdancing contests.  Why?  Because you just know some genitals don't always have that fresh smell to them.  I'd be constantly washing my hands and well...my gentials if that were the case.

"            Truck Stop Transvestite Cock-sucking Whore   That was the name of one of the songs an 'open-miker' played last night.  Before he sang this 'ballad', he explained how he was divorced twice.  Gee, who couldn't live with a guy who was  so  eloquent?  But I digress...let me tell you about  urlLink the greatest movie I've seen in a long time .  Now, before you start rolling your eyes thinking, 'oh Lord, we've heard this before,' (Hal, I  know  you're thinking about 'The Fast Runner' - Inuits rule, btw) you have to hear me out.  Absolutely tremendous.  And it was rated G.  It's a documentary that follows 8 different kids on their way to the National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C.  Maybe I loved it so much because I could relate. (I won our city-wide spelling bee.  I remember by dad hollering words out of the dictionary to me while I got ready for school in the morning.  I ended up not being able to go to regionals, the runner-up had to go in my place, and she lost on 'potato'.  Spelled it with an 'e'.  Talk about CHOKING.) Or maybe I loved it because each person's story was so unique and quirky.  One rich girl wanted her 'au pair' to come to the competition with her.  Another wanted her father, who didn't know a lick of English, to go to Washington DC for the first time in his life.  I laughed (mostly), and felt a tear here and there, but it was also exciting...yes, a  spelling competition  kept me on the edge of my seat.  You felt each kids' nervousness and pain when they lost.  You spelled along with them (ok, maybe that was just me).  It really drew you in.  I don't think  Spellbound  is playing in the Twin Cities, but keep it in mind the next time you want to rent a fantastic flic - good for the whole family!          "
"            Does this happen to you?   In our cubicle culture, soemtimes people will come into my workstation, see that I am on the phone (I am always on the phone) and then have a seat.  I will sometimes stretch my arms out to let them know that I'm well hung...er...I mean...on a lengthy call, but there are a couple of thick customers who will just sit there anyway.  It's getting to where I think I should get some muzak and outdated magazines for my cubicle as waiting room ('Duf the hygienist will see you now, scrape, scrape - why don't you floss?' - but I digress).    So, what I do is hit my mute button, explain my sign language (universally known around the globe and the whole world over for'well hung' or 'long') and ask if I can check in with them when my call is done.  Today, in a stroke of pure dullness, one of our slower colleagues replied by saying 'oh, okay, it's not important, I'll check back with you later.'  Which begs three questions:  if it's not important, why didn't you leave when I flashed you the 'long' sign?  What the hell's the matter with you?  And, how do you navigate complex tasks like brushing your teeth or unlocking a door?         "
"            Tell me about your first love (& loss).   Her name was Tempest.  I couldn't believe she liked me. She was gorgeous, and she had a dark reputation.  I was a squeaky clean nerd, and I kept not knowing what she saw in me.  I was awkward around her much of the time, and she did not respond well to my number one source of comedy...sarcasm (I've outgrown that sarcasm thing BTW).    We rode the same bus, and she lived not too far away.  She was older than me (a trend) and a Leo (another trend), and I was crazy about her even while I was confused (still another trend).  Tempest ushered in a new era for me.  Prior to hanging out with her, I was a model rocket (Dr. Freud white courtesy phone please...Dr. Freud white courtesy phone) fiend.  But after Tempest, it was all girls, all the time (trend).  Sometimes she would come over to go for a swim.  A couple of times, I would ride my Schwinn the two miles to her house (her mom hated me).  I got a car while we dated, and though I had a restricted license, I drove to her house once or twice too.  We hung out for a few months, and I learned a lot.  Some things shareable, some not. She eventually broke up with me to date a guy with a better body and a darker reputation (trend), and I remember being both heartbroken and pragmatic (I couldn't imagine us running away together or anything) (trend).  I still have a hair ribbon that she wore to my house one night, and I still remember that she used to wear this body spray that smelled wonderfully. Right now, I can't remember what it was called (three initials like FDS or something), but it was ATR when I was a school boy.   Sometimes, every once in awhile, I wonder where she is and what she is doing (trend).         "
"            Open Mic Night   I finally went to watch Open Mic Night at Friar Tucks last night, after much prodding from a guy in my buildinghis name is Diesel (real name, Dror)  hes a diamond importer from Israel who plays soccer, loves sexy women (those are his words), and goes to night clubs.  I told him the only reason I came to Friar Tucks was for the $2.00 bottles of Iron City.  And Tim the bartender.  He played an acoustic version of  Where the Streets Have No Name  and sang into the tinny-sounding microphone.  He may be an even bigger U2 fan than Hal.  He yelled at me because he said my friend H and I were more interested in talking to the bartender than listening to him play, and then he asked me about my weekend.  I told him I had a date on Friday.  When he asked about him, I told him we had a sort of interesting and convenient arrangement.  We never called each other during the week.  Hes way too set into his routine: works out Mondays and Wednesdays, always gets his massage on Sundays.  (What guy does  that , btw.) Works during the day on Saturday.    Its a nice arrangement, actually.  No false pretenses, no expectations, no feelings that youre in a job interview during the date because he needs to get married.  He e-mails me and we just do nice things together.  He wants to take me to Charlie Trotters and on his boat.  Diesel said all that butterfly bullshit is temporary anyway.  It fades, and you better make sure that person is your best friend in the end, because thats all you're going to ever get or need in the long run.  He told me I was a good friend and was funny (not sure if he meant funny ha ha or funny weird) and cute and interesting.    He gave me a U2 bootleg when we got back to our building and a copy of his demo.  Im supposed to give him my opinion on it, but am afraid to listen to it for fear of laughing.  Not because it might be bad, but because that sort of thing makes me uncomfortable; so I laugh.  Diesel didnt understand why I laughed so much.  Maybe I need to explain that to him.          "
"             Monday One     Tell me about your first love (& loss).   Matt was a goofy, Irish, dark curly-haired guy.  He made me laughthats what I remember first drawing me to him, and thats what makes me smile when I occasionally think about him today.  He also wrote the best love letters.  Matt gave me roots; he gave me wings.  I had no roots or anything to leap off of (or compare to) before him.  All I had was the burden of my dreamsMatt taught me how to build a bridge between my dreams and who I am.  Let me say that again: we must build a bridge between our dreams and who we are.  Thats why most people never find love, because our dreams get in the way.  Love is about acceptance.  Its about settling.  Settling is the real triumph of love.  Its  easy  to find a great man if you can find one and if he loves you.  But  real  love for  real  people; that means loving  despite .  After we broke up I couldnt get out of bed.  I just kept thinking, if only I had kept a different perspective, if only I wasnt so youngI would understand the significance of needing to have it end later.  But at the time, I just wanted to die.  But then, after recovering from mono (oh, the dreaded kissing disease), something happened.  I went to class.  Everyday, I continued living, going through the routine, and suddenlya month, a summer, a year passed.  And before you knew it, I was ok.  Sure, I missed Matt.  The sadness was gone and it was ok, it made sense to me.  Not the actual break up, but the way things get left behind, the way things get out of youlike the way some things pinch your skin and cling to you forever, but others wash away, just disappear without a rinse.  People, things, places, they can just wash away.  And what is left is a sense of peacefulness.  And relief.          "

Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  My vegetarian chili is the reali deali.  I also like to make vegetarian lasagne and vegetarian grilled cheese sandwiches.

"            Lazy Friday 5    1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?  I prefer bottled water since it's portable.

What are your favorite flavor of chips?  Sour Cream and Onion Baked Lays  especially with a meatball sub from Subway.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  As far as desserts go, Id give myself rave reviews for my apple crisp and peanut butter balls (during Xmas only).  For entrees, I can cook up a mean beef stewand my mac & cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches are both especially nice because I add lots and lots of extra cheese.  Thats the Sconie in me.   4. How do you have your eggs?  Scrambled with cheese, fried in a sandwich.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?  My dear mother made some excellent orange chicken on Mothers Day.  Having been a former home-ec teacher, the woman is an amazing cook plus she was cooking for 35 people on  her  day.

"            As I admitted to Heather last night...Giving Duf' Tone!   I thought Dawson's Creek was the name of the town.  I never saw an episode.  Sucks to be me, I guess.   On another note, people keep giving me tone!  It all started on Monday when the business sponsor for my lead account returned from vacation 'crabby' and gave me tone.  Then, during a conference call, I got into a squabble with our tech lead (we'll call her MJ).  MJ wanted to tell Large Institutional Client A that if we prioritized work ask they have asked us to do, then we would have to revise the timeline for Large Institutional Client B (Large Institutional Client A and Large Institutional Client B are competitors - which means that LICA could give a phlying phuck what happens to LICB's timelines and would think we were morons for even presenting it as a discussion point). When I asked her to stop, she gave me tone; then she called me after the conference call and gave me more tone!  Last night, instead of watching Dawson's Creek, I was doing testing for an implementation and one of our Project Managers gave me tone.  Then, this morning, one of our vendor managers gave me tone.  Everywhere I turn, people are giving me tone!         "
"            Pacey Wins   I was able to catch the last hour of 'Dawson's' last night, although I was a little confused how everything went down exactly, since I missed the first hour.  How did Jen get sick?  How and when did Pacey's brother and Jack get together?  What was with Dawson's hair when they showed flashbacks from the first season?    My fantasy ending of the show would have been like this: 1) Dawson would finally come out of the closet and end up with Pacey's brother.   2) Jack would realize he was only being gay to 'mix it up' in Capeside, reveal his true heterosexual love to Jen, they would get married, she wouldn't die. 3) Pacey and Joey would end up together (wait, that happened). 4) Dawson's mom and Joey's sister would die. (they are so damn annoying) 5) Gran would become mayor of Capeside and live to be 113 years old (like she doesn't already  look  that old). 6) The dorky dropout guy Joey was dating in Boston would move to Capeside and work at Pacey's restaurant.  (Just so I could continue to see more of him...hot!)  And for those out there who still don't know who Katie Holmes (Joey) is,  urlLink here's a still  from one of my favorite movies that she was in: Go.  Hot or not?          "

"            1. What is your favorite magazine?  Vanity Fair.  It takes dedication to get through it each month, but its so worth it.   2. What is your favorite television station?  Wow, tough question.  I have cable, so there are so many to choose from.  Non-network, Im usually on MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, or E!, filling my head with complete nonsense.  On my B list, theres Oxygen (for the Isacc Mizrahi Show), WE (just for the Felicity re-runs God, I love that show).  For all that I enjoy cable, though, I could definitely live without it, which means that favorite channel selection leaves me with ABC, CBS, NBC, WB and Fox to choose from.  If I only have one channel with reception, I go with ABC, because I need my Alias.  But Alias aside, I go with NBC for its collective quality.   I used to like the WB, because of the great shows (remember when they had all the good stuff?).  But now its a sorry shell of its old self.  That said, Im all over the last episode of Dawsons Creek tonight.  Joey had better pick Pacey.  Panda, I love him too.          "

"            Billygoat is Comin' Through Chi...God Help Us All   Just got a last minute e-mail (would you expect anything less) from BG, saying he's coming to Chicago on a red eye from Cali at 6am on Saturday morning for a Bachelor party that night.  He's wondering if he could come right to my place so we could catch breakfast and a 'nice walk through the park.'  I'm all up for a little breakie, but 6am...damn.  I don't even get up that early for work, let alone ex-fiances.

"            It's Tuesday on Wednesday    1. What is your favorite magazine?  I've discussed this before...my guilty pleasure mag when I fly is US.  I adore it...and I have recently stopped hiding it because I don't care who knows that I LOVE celebrity gossip.  When I have to go the brain-fulfilling route, I would say I enjoy Smithsonian (loved the Frida article a few months back), Business 2.0 (esp. nice for a young-professional techie like myself), FastCompany (progressive business-speak), and Entrepreneur (to keep my dream of someday owning my own business alive).  For music, I can't get enough of Q Magazine, although, since it's imported from the UK, the price is high and you can't get the special attached CDs cuz they get lost when shipped over.   2. What is your favorite television station?  I be like Duf...no cable in my humble home.  So I must resort to the more mundane network and local stations.  I really like Public Television (channel 11) on a Saturday afternoon, esp. when they show the entire Anne of Green Gables series.  The WB is something I'm embarrassed to say I enjoy from time to time.  I'm missing the last episode ever of Dawson's Creek tonight, and I forgot to set my VCR, so I'm really bummed (I like me some Pacey, baby.)  Right after work I turn on UPN (channel 10) and watch Blind Date (makes me feel REALLY GOOD about my dating life), and then switch to Fox at 6:30 to watch Seinfeld.  Wow, this sounds like I'm anti-network, which is probably true.  Who in the hell could watch yet  another  episode of Fear Factor or Survivor anyway?  If I had cable, my favorite station would be TLC...hands down.  And maybe Lifetime for the Golden Girls reruns.  Don't get me started again about Bea Arthur.          "
"            The 2sday 2 Because It's 2sday Somewhere!  By Duf Fer   1.  What is your favorite magazine?  Well, for me, I have loved many magazines.  I used to subscribe to  Rolling Stone .  I have also had subscriptions to  Spin ,  Golf World ,  Harper's .  When I fly, I am likely to pick up a copy of  The Economist .  I think  Newsweek  is okay for a corporate sellout publication.  I like  EW  but could never keep up with all the issues..  My only subscription right now is to the only magazine that I think I cannot live without, the  New Yorker .  Friends got me a subscription to  Book  magazine, and I liked it for a year and had no problem letting it lapse.  Lately, i am buying a magazine called  Adbusters  a lot (very, very progressive:  they had an issue called 'I want you to curb your consumption'; but not political, they have barely mentioned the war).  It comes out every other month, and I get it at Whole Foods for the phenomenal price of $6.50.  Still, without question, my favorite magazine is the  New Yorker.    What is your favorite television station?  Okay, for me, the main reason I have a television is sports.  I don't really watch much else.  I want to see  Bernie Mac , but always forget when it is on.  I like  Scrubs , but have the same problem with it - I usually look up at 8:05 on Thursday and realize I missed it.  I am absolutely nuts about  The Simpsons , but am prone to missing it.  The 'Fer family  don't got no cable and we's dishless too (I wonder what percentage of homes have neither cable nor a dish...), so my favorite channel on our TV is CBS.  They do the best job of covering sports (even on a crappy TV, high def is noticeable; their coverage of golf is sublime, friends, absolutely sublime).  When I have access to cable, pretty much all I watch is ESPN.  Therefore, my favorite channel is ESPN.          "
"            A Slow Day at Work   ...but not in the news.   urlLink This  sounds like something that would happen at a wedding Jim Anchower would attend.  Good grief!          "
"            Is it Too Lateis She Gone Forever?   A few weeks back I went to a rock showbut this was no ordinary rock show.  It included all the bands Stoner loves.  In fact, it was a  Tribute to Stoner .  She had been moshing at a Matthew Sweet concert prior to this.  Now, who on earth would  mosh  to Matthew Sweet?  Well, a true fan wouldand thats how we lost her.  A huge blow to the head was all it took.  So in attendance at her show were her other favorite artists: India Arie stood up to say a few words about her long-lost soul sistah, Justin Timberlake dedicated an entire dance number in her honor (of course, he was wearing her favorite fedora), and Dirty Vegas got everyone to chill out and remember the good times; the times when Stoner would tell all of us about her encounters with chocolate and caffeine or her latest tales with her sweetie.  Of course Mr. Sweet arrived to give his condolences and offered to sing his song Ive Been Waiting, because weve all been waiting; waiting for something, whether it be a post from an old friend, a long overdue visit to Chicago, that burrito at Chipotle, Liz Phairs new album, or just a nice warm day (for a change).    I dont know about you, but Im sick of waiting for all of it.            "
"            The Shape of Things  turned out to be excellent.  I found myself laughing and smiling (perhaps devilishly) throughout the entire film.  The men in the audience were not doing the same, however.  Same writer and director as  urlLink In The Company of Men , another rather controversial flic, but this time around, the female gets her turn.  Evelyn takes turning a man into a 'project' to a whole other level.  I don't want to reveal too much...just go and see it; if for no other reason but to crush on the adorable Paul Rudd (of  Clueless  fame).  Guys - you can stare at Rachel Weisz, but you might end up just hating her guts.  She's  my  new role model.  On a side note, I have always been in love with Liz Phair, but  urlLink this song  made me fall in love with her all over again.           "
"           Best... stories... ever!  I've been through a lot with Stoner, but never inter-galactic battle or rollerblading.  Now I feel like I was there, too.  And DJS, nice photoshop.  Get help.          "
"            We Lost A Great One Over The Weekend...This Is Stoner's Story   I know we never talked about this before, but Stoner and I are part of a squardon called Freedom Force Five.  Don't bother looking it up, it's a top secret faction of the Star Tyme Federation where we defend our planet (and neighboring planets) from hostile situations.  Remember that big asteroid the size of Texas that was heading for us a couple of months back?  Well, let's just say we handled that skirmish with tact and a firm resolve.  We've been a crack force for as long as you've spitting up all over yourself, and I was beginning to think that our squadron was indestructible.  Until last night.  I got the call and rushed to the jump station, where, true to form Stoner was already strapped into her flight suit.  She had a patch of Papa Smurf sewn onto the arm of the navy blue jumper.  Not regulation, but when you're busy saving the world from The Goztok Armada, rules don't always apply.  We high-fived and put aside our disagreement on whether Oprah is a vital member to society or a money hungry ho, and took to our starships.  No time for a long drawn out overdramatic countdown...our nimble little cruisers leapt into the stars, unnoticed by the thousands of people on the surface.  They were too busy watching American Idol, or Survivor or some other drivel.  'Stoner, DJS...good of you to join us.'  I spotted the rest of the F3 Squadron and tilted the flight stick to the left, doing a barrel roll into formation.  Always looking to one-up me, Stoner launched into hyperspace, froze time and materialized her ship into the line-up.  The stunt had Turk and Whippet clapping in their flight suits.  The commander, Topside, wasn't having it.  'Save the manuevers for the fight, Stoner,' he scolded.  Deep down he always thought of her as 'the special one' and let infractions like the Smurf patch go.  I tended to agree with him, though.  She was always the one you wanted on your wing in a pinch, even if she did play that damn teeny-bopper music over the headsets.  We flipped our radar scanners to 'battle' and waited.  The Omni-scan picked up something, otherwise we would be sleeping only to go to our Joe jobs in the morning.  Something was out there.  Since my suit rode a little tight in the crotch, I took the opportunity to grab the groin of my suit and give it a no-nonsense tug.  As I did, my flight stick was knocked forward, sending me into an unexpected nosedive.  'There goes, DJ,' Whippet cried over the helmet-comms.  'He's been hit.'  Before I could protest, and right my starship, the largest Goztok Armada ship I'd ever seen rose from behind the moon.  It made everything rumble, and knocked our targeting systems offline.  I gasped as I saw the enormous laser cannon mounted on top of the ship.  'You've got to be shitting me,' I whispered, pulling back on the throttle.  I was in a tight spot and with my slip of the control, I left my squadron unprotected.  With no time to rejoin the pack, the Goztok ship unleashed hell.  Now, I know none of you have ever been in a space fight, but let me tell you.  When you're in the thick of it, you don't have much time to react.  It's not like the shows on TV or the movies where you get a couple free screw-ups, your shields hold and you can get the power up and save the day.  It's not like that at all.  'Arrghghghggh,' was all I heard as the ships above me exploded into a ball of fire.  Just like that, Topside, Whippet, Turk, and yes...Stoner were all but a memory.  'Noooo,' I shouted and pulled myself up into the thick of battle.  'You sons of a bitch...that was a Pandylander!'  I spun my Hot-Wing into the fight and did my trademark barrel-roll-while-I'm-shooting trick.  The twin-mounted, coolant-cooled laser cannons erupted and spit laser-ific death up on my enemies.  The giant Goztok ship just seemed to absorb the shots.  I increased the power of my front-quarter shields, and swooped beneath the monster ship.  It looked like a steel burrito, but laden with laser cannons.  On my malfunctioning Omni-scan, I picked up a reading.  If I wasn't mistaken it was...  Stoner!  I don't know if I was delirious from the tears in my eyes at seeing the crack team of star fighters reduced to nothing, or that I was happy to see Stoner still alive in her crippled ship, but it looked to me like her flaming vessel was on a collision course with the Goztok mother ship.  'For mother....earth,' she gasped over the helmet-comms.'  'No!  Stoner, it's not the only way.'  'Only...way...I know...how...'  Before I could do another thing, Stoner's ship disappeared into one of the small cargo bays inside the Goztok ship.  A second later, there was a small explosion, followed by another, and another...and then the big one.  As I turned and manuevered back toward the Earth, the Goztok ship erupted into a ball of flame, sending chunks of metal, alien carcasses and debris all through our solar system.  As the only member left of Freedom Force Five, I wiped back the tears and collected myself.  Sure we'd only saved the world a couple hundred times together and there was always the danger of permanent retirement, but Stoner inspired me that night.  I dialed up her dance-y music and listened to her favorite little teeny-bopper sing about girls and dancing until I reentered the atmosphere.  Damn if it wasn't catchy.  And yeah...wherever she is, Stoner can be my wing woman anytime.          "
"            Reminiscing or Rage Against the Dying of the Light or Nothing Gold Can Stay or Where the Fuck is Stoner  By Duf Fer  One time, me and Stoner walked around Uptown (coffee at Dunn Brothers, brunch at Figlio (her the omelette with cured proscuitto and brie, Duf a Bloody Mary and two eggs scrambled with Rosemary potatoes on the side), tried to get tickets for a matinee, but it was sold out, brother  never let it be said that the Twin Cities dont appreciate Almodovar!  Anyway). We talked about renting a canoe, but ended up getting Rollerblades at one of the local skate shops and doing a couple of laps around Calhoun.  It was a perfect day except at one point either my feet or her feet started hurting so we stopped skating for a moment and just chilled.  The way people just chill sometimes when chillin is all you need. After a healing moment or two, Stoner and I sat at Calhouns edge and hung our toesies in her pristine tides. It was one of those nights where initially the water was cold, but then, as you adjusted to it, it seemed perfect, you couldnt have imagined it any other way.  As the sun set, casting a perfect orange hue over the majestic lake, we commented on the restorative power of the water, downtown reflected on its stillness, the sun in harmony with its body, with us.  We skipped stones and traded stories.  I think we even talked about our dreams. We both conjured a day when we could meet on the World Wide Web as part of a larger community and expound on the mundane and trivial; we felt questions and answers should be a part of it so someone might ask:   what do you think happened to Stoner?    And the members of the community would all answer.   I confess, it was more her dream than mine, but man, what a great night.  Eventually, the absented sun left behind a sky studded with stars.  We saw one in particular  so bright it didnt seem real.  Its presence made that night, the kind of night when friendships are cemented, even more awesome.  Anyway, looking back on it all now that Stoner has left the land, Im only thankful that I got a chance to know herto really, really know her.  Reminiscing on that night and thinking about Stoner, I wonder if some stars just shine too brightly and then, fade too soon.  Sometimes I wonder if Stoner was that star.  Other times, I wonder if Pandyland is the star and Stoner was the sun.  Then, I wonder if Pandyland is the lake upon which all these images are reflected, and Stoner is downtown with clouds in the way so we cant see her.  Then I realize it doesnt figure that Ill know everything that day meantI just miss her, man.  Im not going to cry or anything  I shed my last tear over it this weekend, when I logged in for the 33rd time and still there was nothing.  I just think that if she is under a rock with no knife to cut her arm off with, and it is taking her a really long time to post because of having to type with one hand and fight off pain and passing out and stuff, then, wellat least we had that one night, you know?

"            Playing Hookie (kind of)   My cold became a little out of control over the weekend, and I'm sure the drinking and getting 'sleepy' on Friday night around the bonfire and on the beach did not help things.  T and I had a good weekend in Sconie...other than getting hit on by some chachis on Water Street and them not understanding sarcasm.  'Don't you get it, clowns? We only talk to guys who have hot tubs.'  'But my buddy here has a hot tub in Pewaukee.'  My brother then chimed in: 'I think she was thinking more of, you know,  urlLink Sybaris ?'  So I woke up this morning, hacking my insides out, and called in sick.  As luck would have it on a 'sick day' the sun came out in all its gloriousness.  So now T (who is also taking, as she would say, a 'mental health day') and I are going to the movies.  And we're going to see  urlLink this .  They just started chanting 'sit down whore' on Jerry Springer.  What a great day.          "

"            The Impossibly Difficult to Answer Five  By Duf Fer   1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.   'Jack and Diane' By John Cougar (Mellencamp).  So many memories from the summer it came out; including my first job as a dishwasher and cranking it up in the kitchen whenever it came on the radio.  I will always love it.     2. Name two songs that always make you cry.   If I were to go the silly route, I would say 'Blister in the Sun' by the Violent Femmes and 'Paradise by the Dashboard Lights' by Meatloaf because I HATE those songs so much.  I really, really hate them.   But, to play it straight, the songs that move me almost to tears are 'I Know' by Fiona Apple '...and you can use my skin, to bury secrets in...' and 'MLK' by U2.  There are many others that touch me deeply.  I can think of only one time that music made me cry.  When I was in high school, I woke up one morning looking for something on the telly.  Nothing was on, so I settled for some old guy playing piano at an ornate concert hall.  As the concert went on and I watched him more, I could tell he was sincerely moved. The audience was moved too, and the music was so perfect that when it was all over, I wept.  To me, the guy looked so old that there was no way he could play  that  fast and  that  perfectly, but he was amazing.  The depth of feeling is unmatched for me by any musical event I have ever seen.  Nothing comes close.  So, yeah, I cried, and no, I didn't let a tear go, I broke down. It was so amazing and sincere that I fell apart.  I learned that it was Vladimir Horowitz and that he was returning to Russia for a series of concerts after years of exile.  Somehow I think I knew that from the music...    3. Name three songs that turn you on.   'Music Sounds Better with You' by Stardust -preferably the club mix, but whateva' you got.  'Ecstasy' by PJ Harvey - preferably the 4 track demo, but whateva' you got. And (don't laugh): 'Violet' by Hole.     4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.   'Only One I Know' The Charlatans UK, 'Boys of Summer' by Don Henley, 'Walt Whitman's Niece' by Billy Bragg and Wilco and 'Wonce Again Long Island' by De La Soul.  I could add a zillion more, but I will just add two:  'Clap Your Hands' by the Black Eyed Peas and 'Everything's Not Lost' by Coldplay.   5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.   Like Hal, I am on a desert island with albums:  'Dry' by PJ Harvey.  'Mermaid Avenue' by Billy Bragg and Wilco.  'The Unforgettable Fire' by U2.  'Stakes is High' by De La Soul.  'Horowitz in Moscow' by Vladimir Horowitz.          "

"            The Straight Dope From America's Favorite Cauc-izzy: DJS    1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.   Just about anything by DMX.  He's got this ego thing that kind of bugs me and he acts like he's such a friggin' tough guy, but at the same time his songs pretty much kick ass.  I hear his new song 'X Is Gonna Give It To Ya' and I want to seriously go out and fight people.  It's that good.  And yes...I'll probably end up buying his damn CDs now.    2. Name two songs that always make you cry.   Weird.  I don't think there are any that make me cry instantly.  One that I can think of would be 'Cats In the Cradle' (not sure who sings it).  I'm sure that when the day comes that my dad isn't around anymore, it'll make me cry like a lil' bitch.  I think there might be a couple of Johnny Cash numbers that make me sad, too.  That one that's on his new CD that Sting wrote called 'I Hang My Head.'  That's a sad one.  Yep.   3. Name three songs that turn you on.   'D'Yer Mak'er' by Led Zeppelin, but only the Sheyl Crow version.  Her voice is all scratchy and HOT, HOT, HOT.  'Please God' by Ana Voog.  Yes.  The local Minneapolis girl who has that webcam at  urlLink Ana Voog.Com  has a hidden track on her album.  It's somewhat naughty.  DJ likey.  Last but not least, I guess I'd say 'The Love Boat' theme song.  Love....exciting and new...   4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.   Oh, good Christ.  'Battleflag' by the Lo Fidelity All-Stars.  'What I Got' by Sublime.  'I Left My Wallet In El Segundo' by A Tribe Called Quest.  'Rotten World Blues' by EELS.  I don't know.  This changes constantly, so check back with me next week.   5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.    'Aurora' by Bjork.  'Untouchable' by Garbage.

"            I Haven't Posted In a While.  That Doesn't Mean I Don't Love You.   The Boomsticks (the softball team I'm on) has their first game tonight.  I'm predicting a Boomstick loss since our infield needs some major, major work.  We had a scrimmage in the rain on Sunday against another team associated with our company and that didn't go so well.  Not that we're not a good team, but they were short handed and we ended up giving them a few people from our squad to fill in their gaps.  Of course, they were a couple of our better players.  First of all, the team we played, call themselves Rage.  Yeah...totally gay.  They look like they're stunt doubles for the Addams Family and after a few innings I could see why they named the team Rage.  The catcher who has something totally fucked up with his eye, spent the bulk of the time yelling at the pitcher.  Why?  I don't know...maybe it's because we were hitting everything he put over the plate.  The funny part was seeing said catcher up at the plate.  When he wasn't popping up into the infield, he was swinging the bat like he was at the 'ring the bell' thingy at the carnival.  You know...swinging down and swatting the ball as opposed to swinging nice and level.  Wow...I sound like a total sports nerd.  Don't be deceived.  It rained, we played anyway and I think I yelled a little at how horrible our infield played.  People were bobbling balls, overthrowing, and missing easy outs.  I think at one point I shouted:  Looking good Boomsticks, looking real good.   I need to take it down a notch.   In other news:  the girls that sit next to my cube here at work say the word 'girl' once every 3 words.  I am not even kidding.   'Girl, his basement was all flooded and he ran downstairs to save his Sega Genesis, girl.'  'Girl?'  'Girl, it's so frustrating and girl, I told him that he needs to fix that shit, girl.'  'Oh girl.  You know they never listen, girl.'  'Girl, you feel me?'    This is the inside of my head:   girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl....         "

"            Keep On Truckin': Why Not to Waste Your Energy on People Who Suck   Some people are energy vampires.  When you are with them or after you depart, you feel drained or depressed.  They are emotionally insatiable; no matter how much attention or time you give them, there is always one more thing they need.  If you try to help them feel better, they resist and argue for their problems.  They don't recognize their ability to generate joy, love, or prosperity for themselves, so they look to others to sustain them.  Watch out for anyone who says, 'I have so much love to give and no one to give it to.'  Immediately translate that into, 'I am the emotional black hole of the universe, and I will suck every ounce of life force from you if you let me.'  Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.

He cut the hell out of my cuticles (they were bleeding).  He painted 'outside the lines'.  There wasn't even a much-awaited hand massage.

"            Not Enough Time for a Proper Post   I miss you.  Last night we went out drinking to 1) celebrate the dysfuntion of my team, and 2) celebrate the fact that a friend of mine graduated from the Port Authority police academy.  #2 was much more fun, but #1 was free, so I can't complain too much.  After #2, my coworker D and I went to an Italian restaurant/bar so she could buy me a b-day drink.  Here we ran into some (mostly) foreign waiters/bartenders.

"            The Thursday3 Brought to you in DJX Setraphonic Siz-ound.     1. So, what's your break-up story?  My previous girlfriend was a mess.  When she wasn't 'hanging' out with her previous boyfriend, she was calling me at work threatening to cut herself if I said I'd break up with her.  Yeah...a real keeper.  Well, we were on and off and when we were back on, she decided that she wanted to go on a 'business trip' with her ex-boyfriend.  You know...just as 'friends.'  I wasn't too crazy about the idea.  When I grilled her about the accomodations, I learned that she was indeed staying in a hotel room with him with only ONE bed.  Her logic was: 'Yeah, but you've stayed with your friend in Oregon and she's a girl.'  For the record, I slept in the bottom bunk of her kid's bed.  Not even REMOTELY the same thing.  Despite my pleas for her to not go, she went.  When she came back, I promptly dumped her like a visit to the restroom after eating at Khan's Mongolian BBQ.  The following is an e-mail conversation that transpired weeks after the dump-age..    Crazy:  I'm sorry I called you so late last night. I just wanted to tell you about this dream I had that you were in....blah blah blah blah...   DJS:  What part of 'I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU EVER AGAIN' don't you understand?   2. Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?   I used to.  I've got this thing in my genetic code where I don't want to let people down, including ex-girlfriends.  The previous story (and yeah, there's a lot more to it) was the exception to the rule.  I don't give two shits about that psycho now.   3. Stevie Wonder says 'there is superstition.' Discuss.

"            The Return of an August Tradition: Now in Stereophonic, Quadraphonic Technicolor! The Thursday3 By Duf 'Bling Bling' Fer    1.  So, what's your break-up story?  In college, I had a girlfriend (well, more than one, but I digress), we'll call her BP.  One night, drunk at a party, BP got mad at me and threw a bottle of Heineken at me (Duf ducked, bottle breezed by).  I ended it because she clearly had an anger management problem.  She called me a lot and even waited for me in my bed one night (scary).  Eventually, we reached an understanding (or so I thought).  One afternoon, I was at home watching Jeopardy (With Alex Trebek - a Canadian) after a vigorous academic schedule.  BP comes down the hall walking out of my roommate's room.    BP:   I just *&^%$# your roommate. Duf:   Who was better? BP:   He was by far. Duf:  That's funny, your mama said I was.  BP remains silent then throws herself at Duf and beats him about the head and neck.  Offending roomate removes BP from the person of Duf.  Eventually, Duf, roommate and BP reach an understanding.   2.  Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?  No, I pretty much tell the truth.  However, I have broken up with someone from the (edge of the) bed of someone else so that I would not 'cheat.'     3.  Stevie Wonder says 'there is supersitition.'  Discuss.  Stevie hasn't been so right since 'Master Blaster.'  I try to get the same hotel room if I was in it during a good business trip (or if it has a great shower) (Hal calls me princess for this).  When my team is in the NCAA tournament, I try to watch all the games in the same place and wearing the same things I wore during a (usual) first round win.

"            How to Make an Ass of Yourself  by Panda Bear  Last night I attended an event with my grad school alumni association.  Not only was this going to be an important networking experience, but I was also going to be inducted onto the board of directorsso I had to be on my best behavior.  However, theres one detail Im leaving out here  the event involved  wine tasting .  I was doomed.  I started drinking a nice white wineand it was going down way too easy.  I was greeting people as they came inDont worry though  I wasnt using my Country Bar technique.  No one was getting his/her chest strokedbut I was getting pretty chatty, especially when I met some people who could potentially get me a job.  I met a guy who worked in Orbitzs marketing department and talked to him for a while.  More wine was tasted.  I then talked to the Dean for a while, but at that point I remember telling myself Panda, keep your shit together.  Just smile and nod.  Dont say anything stupid.  By the time the wine class was supposed to start, everyone was lit.  The poor lady who was supposed to teach us about all the wines hated us.  We were all talking (very loudly) during her entire presentation.  (Mental note: at the next event dont let the attendees DRINK before the presentation.)  We had more wine, and more wine, and well, you get the idea.  The event ended at 8pm, but of course that was  way too early  for me to go homeso I suggested to my friends (at that point, EVERYONE was my friend) that we stay and buy some more drinks.  The Orbitz guy and I were pretty tight by then.  I thought I was definitely going to get a job offer from thisuntil I realized he just wanted to get into my pants.  Do you want to go out sometime?  I think youre really cute.  Wait, I thought I was networking.  Instead, me talking to him was mistaken for flirting.  The good news is that within only a few days Ive found potential job prospects (at Target and Orbitz), but the bad news is I have to date these guys first.  Fuck me.  I shared a cab with the Orbitz guy (would you believe he lives down the street from me  in IANs buildingJesus) and right when I got into my place he called.  I could tell you were into me at the eventblah, blah, blah.  Sorry, friend.  All I wanted was your business card.         "

"            The PBJ3 (Sans Burritos, BB, & Duf) and Those Crazy Dancing Fools   PBJ3 started out innocently enough.  HAL and I showed up after DJS and Bob (not his real name) had already ordered some delicious, but unhygienic, burgers and fries at the  Country Bar .  HAL and I waited for what seemed like an hour for our first drink(s): a bottle of ML and a well drink happy-hour special  rum and coke (definitely the clearest rum and coke Ive ever consumed).  First, the  singing .  We initially got the book of  b-side karaoke hits .  We chose a few numbers and since the place wasnt being run by the  karaoke Gestapo  (please refer to PBJ1 October archives), Mark and DJS got called up to sing a rousing rendition of  Brass Monkey  by the Beastie Boys.  The crowd fell in love, and couldnt wait for more.  Yours truly got up to dedicate a number to the Country Bar  Country Bar, this one is for youThank You for everything.  Yep, I brought things down a notch with  a Dido tune . We soon found the  Karaoke Bible , and thank God we had time for a few more cocktails before DJS and I were called up to sing a duet of  Total Eclipse of the Heart .  This brought tears to the eyes of most of the patrons.  Mark then made the crowd holla with the classic sensation,  Runaround Sue .  Second, this summary could not be complete without discussing the  bar full of boozehounds . (Ourselves included.)  I felt it necessary  to greet everyone who came into the bar .  They either got a good  chest stroking  (guys only), or a very enthusiastic  Welcome to the Country Bar! greeting .  I wanted people to feel comfortable while smoking, drinking, and singing various ditties like  Gin n Juice  (sung only ONCE all night, btw.)  In the case of Kool Kirby, however, he got a nice  leg hump  to remember the evening by.  Im not quite sure if those coming in were terrified by this display, or if they stayed just because of it.  Baby Got Back brought out the worst in everyone, especially  a guy with gold teeth  who told me I had a little back.  One fella came right from work at Outback Steakhouse,  wearing his bling  (or as HAL pointed out, more appropriately,  his pieces of flair ).  I also witnessed a terrible crime   a classless sluts thong  was sticking out and was just begging to be snapped.  This lead me to meet a guy named Lee.  For those who are wondering, DJS made sure to ask whether or not he wore  Lee Jeans .  For the record, I dont even think he was wearing pants (probably prompted by DJS plea for everyone to  take off their pants ).  Finally, the evening was concluded by  eating pizza at Dulonos .  More American Flag glasses could have been stolen, but that seemed inappropriate to DJS who couldnt complain enough about  our salad pizza .    We missed Duf and BB, but photos are in the process of being developed as I type.  2 roles, in fact.  But the summary above should not overshadow  Saturday Night Fever .  Mells Beauty Bar ended up being a complete bust  only one manicurist for the entire establishment?  Forget about it.  This got us in the mood to  get our groove on  at  Drink , not a place we would normally frequent, but it seemed just right for that nightespecially when everyone heard  their favorite songs  and we got a choice spot to dance,  right in front of the window .  After Marc danced for 2 bachelorette parties, we annoyed the cops, we got elbowed by falling-down-drunk couples, we broke the glass, and smacked each others asses,  we left on a high note .   In other news   Its a good sign when:   he calls (when he says hes going to call) and we end up talking for almost 2 hours.  Its a bad sign when:  you find out his friends have given him the nickname of Chachi.          "
"            Will You Take a Visa with My Mother's Name on It? The Friday Five on a Rainy Monday By Duf Fer    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   I have the original natural hair:  the afro, and I keeps it low, yo.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?   When I was eight, I had an afro (power to the people with no delay), that I would corn row on weekends (corn rows hurts BTW).  I had a Philly fade in college (a.k.a. the high top fade, a.k.a. the kid-n-play lite), but other than that, I have had the same style pretty much my whole life just at varying lengths depending on how lazy I am about my barber visits.     3. How do your normally wear your hair?   Low like a marine (Semper Fi, yo).   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   I would wear a long ass beard and dreadlocks (seriously), but the corporate world is not ready for a Rasta Manager.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Two:  when I was in high school, the clipper fell off and I was bald, baby, bald.  But I got the next cut free.  What is up with the next cut free deal anyway?  I want the current cut an the next three cuts free.  The other hair disaster was when I lived in D.C. (Marion Barry - best mayor ever - if you like crack and prostitution and late buses).  I went to a salon to get my hair cut.  I got a serviceable cut and some pretty rude treatment.  I was a poor as hell college kid, and when they told me the fee (BB, PB and H will yawn, but you have to understand that at that point I had never paid more than $10 for a haircut) was $50, I almost wept.  I think I ended up charging that to Mother Duf.         "

"            If There Was Ever A Night That I Needed To Drink 5-8 Beers...It's Tonight.   I'm a corporate trainer/communications expert by day.

I know somewhere betwixt jack and shit about all this network, internet, router stuff that computer nerds eat for breakfast.  I've spent the bulk of my day on the phones with clowns in California who have been trying to replicate a problem we're having here at work.  It's cut into my 'normal' work time and I don't get a penny more for doing any of this shit.  To quote Dirty:  Happy Friday friends...and fuck me.   And now...The Friday Five brought to you in part by DJS Industries, a subsidiary of the Soft Drink corporation.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   It's short, but kind of long on top right now.  I don't know that it's necessarily wavy or curly, but it's thick.  It's like a goddamn brillo pad.    2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  The biggest thing I notice is that I've gotten a lot more gray hair over the last 5 years or so.  I'm only 30 years old, but I fear that by the time I reach 40, I'll look like Phil Donohue.  I guess I can be grateful that I won't ever, ever, ever be bald.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?   As low-maintenance as possible.  I'm a guy for Christ's sake.  I don't need to mess with that kind of shit.  I do hate it when it gets too long.  You see, I'm cursed with a large head (physically, you twits) and when my hair (thick hair) gets long, my head size grows exponentially.  That's when I need to cut 'er down, yo.    4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   The gray would be gone.  Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.  Well...maybe a cowlick or two would get outta my sight.  Sometimes I get the Alfalfa thing going on in the back.    5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?   I had some broad in high school cut my hair for me.  She had a shaver but no guards.  I told her 'who cares, cut it anyway.'  She applied the shaver to my head and slipped.  Bzzzzzzzzzzzt!  There was a three inch bald spot in front of my ear.  I shrugged and said 'well, you might as well make it even.'  This was back in the mullet days, so she proceded to shave the side of my hair, leaving it long in front and long in back.  I looked like some kind of crazed Indian brave with a thick mohawk.  Two days later, I had my picture taken for my health club membership.  I could never get away with it now, but it looked kind of rockstar.         "

I might even get past my  urlLink Vin Diesel  aversion and see the original.  Maybe.  For those not in-the-know, Mr. D was not in the sequel.  On a side note, when I googled the words 'I hate Vin Diesel',  urlLink KMC Forums came up .  I can't make this stuff up.         "
"            The FF in full effect.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Naturally wavy.  Medium length.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  Its gotten darker (from light blonde to dishwater brown, but I color it enough to deny my brunette-ness).  Its also gotten curlier.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  I get lazy often.  I like wearing it up so as not to deal with it.   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  I would love a good haircolor.  Really, I would.  I spend a fortune on getting it done, and it kills me because each time I leave the salon with okay results.  For the money and time that goes into it, I should want to marry my hair.  Or at least sleep with it.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Im not risky enough to have all-out disasters, though like any girl, Ive had my perm regrets.  However, last time I got my hair cut, Danielle (her real name) decided to give me bangs.  This despite the fact that I have a cowlick that denies all bangs.  So I had to bobby pin the bangs away for the longest time (I still have to, almost 3 months later!).  Im afraid to go back.          "
"            eBay Scare   I like to mix it up, especially when I'm bored at work.  So I was talking with my coworker and we thought it would be a great idea to have a ping-pong table here at work in our corner office.  I said 'That's easy - we'll check 'em out on eBay!'  That was a mistake.  We went on eBay and looked up ping-pong tables.  A slightly used one popped up on the screen for less than $100.  For shits and giggles, I bid.  I was immediately overbid, which made it obvious that someone was Proxy Bidding - I assumed they put a maximum bid in for $100, so the site automatically puts in another bid for them when someone else bids.  So I put in another bid.  And won - I was now the top bidder.  Which immediately made me panic.  Two seconds later, though, someone put in a higher bid.  Relief!  But wait....5 minutes later?  They retracted their bid.   I was on top again.   Our first reaction: 'Fuck.'  Initial concern: how in the hell would we ship it here (the seller required the buyer to pay for shipping).  More important concern: if our NY office would find out we had a ping-pong table, we'd be fired for sure (but I suppose I can think of worse ways to get let go...).  So I performed an eBay no-no.  I retracted my bid, with the consequence of now having a negative record on eBay for the next 6 months.  Oh well.  It would have been pretty cool to have 'Ping-Pong Tournament Fridays' though.  That would mix well with our Friday Beer Run.  Who woulda thunk eBay could almost give you a heart attack?         "
"            A Friday Five Close to my Heart    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Now it is naturally wavy and I straighten it everyday.  And it is short...but I'm growing it out which is taking forever.  I am very impatient.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  When I was little, my hair was stick straight and my mom insisted on the 'Dorothy Hamill' haircut = a.k.a. the 'Bowl Cut'.  I was already a tomboy growing up, but that hair cut made me look even more masculine.  When my little bro and I would be out together, we would be referred to as 'those cute little boys.'  I think this gave me a huge complex.  Then one day in grade school my mom agreed to take me to the salon and get me a perm. (Remember when this was actually cool??)  This started me down the road of  hair hell .  The perm never went away and I had naturally curly hair (Felicity-type curls) all the way through high school.  I also grew my hair out in high school giving me a horrific 'poodle look.'  In college I really started experimenting with my haircuts and color.  I was a hair model for a while which means that I would get my hair done for free or at a discount if I let them do WHATEVER THEY WANTED.  Please refer to question #5.  2 summers ago, my hair was the shortest it's ever been...even shorter than all y'alls' (with the exception of Duf's...his is pretty short).  But now it's finally to where I want it to be.  Yep, it took me 28 years to finally get it right.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  Like I said above - straight and sometimes behind my ears.  I like to keep the cut very 'wash-n-go.'   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  I always wanted really, really straight hair like those Vidal Sassoon girls.  I love those angular type haircuts.  Remember that band from the Eighties -  urlLink Swing Out Sister ?  I love her hair.  I guess you always want what you don't have because you don't know how many times (when I still kept my hair curly) people came up to me saying 'What I'd give for your hair.'  Hell, you can have it.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  I have had way too many disasters, but I have only cried once.  I always remember to keep in mind that it  will  grow out.  I think Bassy can remember my experiments with out-of-the-box hair color during college.  She was my roommate at the time - my hair had a nice purple hue for a few weeks, and then it turned a weird red-orange color.  My biggest consistent mistake has been getting it cut too short.  One time, when I was still going to a transsexual hair stylist here in Chicago (another story for another day), I was shaved up the back and had spit curls cut on the side.  That was wacky.  In the past few years, though, I've been much more conservative.  If I was working in a record store and not for a software company who knows what I would look like right now.          "

It's because of people who use search engines to scour the internet for porn.  'Sexy Animal Sluts' is the big one.  I'm not kidding.

I know this sounds tre gay, but I'm on the Entertainment Committee and since we've done Bagel Bowling 3 times already and we've cooked breakfast for people more often than we care to remember, I thought it would be kind of fun (and stupid) to have people get into it and rock the mic on the rooftop of our parking garage here at work.  And they bought it.  There are going to be around 9 performances today starting at 1pm.  We'll be eating mouthwatering hotdogs, delicious chips, and savory soft drinks.  I'm performing with a friend here at work and it's going to be abso-fucking-lutely crazy.  There will be pictures and I will post them here on Pandyland, since I know our ratings have been slipping.

"            Counter-Counter Point  By Duf Fer  Two weeks ago I bought a skirt (mini no less) at Anthropolgie, and I have been tickled pink.  It frames my ass beautifully, hangs at the same level in front and back, and is really easy to hike up at the urinal.  It is well worth the $125 I paid for it.  Now I can just find a matching bag (Kate Spade, please) and shoes (Jimmy Choo, please), I'll be all set.    If there is a cat fight between Hal and PB at PBJ3, I'll cry and cry and cry that I missed it.         "
"            Counterpoint:  Do Buy a Skirt on Sale   With all due respect, Panda, your first mistake was shopping for clothing at Anthropologie.  Sure, they are a great place to find a $50 knick-knack, but let's be realistic about their clothes.  I think you said it all with your reference to a $90 piece of cotton with straps.  Do I really need to point out that this item was probably made in a Taiwanese sweatshop from scraps that the Urban Outfitters people didn't want, at a cost of $0.13?  Give me the right sales price to justify this - 50% off?  75?  Sorry.  While I feel for you and your frustration, I think you're a smarter shopper than that.  You can do better.  I think you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as it were.  One cannot stop purchasing skirts on sale simply because her friend bought a piece-of-crap burlap sack at Anthropologie.  Sorry, friend.          "
"            Don't Buy a Skirt on Sale   So I go to  urlLink Anthropologie , a store known for it's over-priced merchandise.  I skip looking at the full-priced clothes (a tank for $90? yeah right.) and make a bee-line to the sales rack.  I found a choice long, brown, linen skirt with these weird rips on the bottom...it had a sort of edgy look that I liked, plus, it was half off.  Sweet no?  This skirt sucks.  I wore it for the first time today to work.  The skirt fits strangely - it clings to my ass, but has a loose waist, so when I walk it slowly creeps down.  My ass was pretty much hanging out of it in the bus today.  Lord help me if I've turned into Thong.  When I walked the 2 blocks from where the bus drops me off to where my office is, I was pulling it up the entire time.  I'm sure everyone who passed me thought I had major problems.  Moral of the story: most of the time you get what you pay for.  But I still wouldn't buy a tank for $90.         "
"            3concerts8days  By Duf Fer  In the past 8 days, I have seen 3 concerts.  Not bad for a married man (props to my lady).  Last Monday, I saw Coldplay at the University of Illinois - Chicago Civic Center.  On Friday night, I saw Wilco at the Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden.  Last night, I saw Pearl Jam at the Xcel Energy Center.    If I ranked the bands among my favorites, I would rank them thusly:  Wilco Coldplay Pearl Jam  [Coldplay and Pearl Jam are almost indistinguishable in my ranking; I like Wilco quit a bit more than the other two, and I love the other two.]  But I would rank the concerts:  Pearl Jam (best show I've seen in quite awhile) Coldplay Wilco  The show last night was phenomenal.  The band was tight.  The crown was hyped.  They did covers (including 'Driven to Tears' by the Police and 'Rockin' in a Free World' by Neil Young).  The energy was electrifying. The Xcel Energy Center turned the house lights on (meaning 'you don't have to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here'), and the band played on.  It was political.  Humorous (a fan joined the band for a rousing number).  As the years have gone on, the band has only gotten better.  They even waxed nostalgic about not having been to MN for five years (I saw the last show as well - I saw both with my friend Renee - a faithful Pandyland reader - we waxed nostalgic about all that has changed (and not changed) since the last show).  So, I found myself, a couple of times, remiscing about my turbulent 20s.  Thinking about love and loss and those crazy times.  I thought about grundge and the whole Seattle scene and Kurt Cobain and there was emotional force to it all for me.  I didn't cry or nothing, but it added layers to a show that, even without them, would have slain me.    I mean, even  urlLink the opening act  rocked.  The cherry on top of a great night:  we kinda sorta partied with Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist 'Jack' after the show.    All in all, a magical evening.           "

"            The I-Don't-Feel-So-Well Monday 5 by DJS      1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  Visit Egypt.  Ever since I was a young-in (and I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark) I wanted to head out to Egypt and check out some pyraminds, tse tse flies, and some delicious artifacts.  I used to actually read up on all of the ancient lore and I was convinced that I could find the lost ark of the covenenant.  Now that I'm older and a bit more agnostic, I'm not sure it ever exists.  But...it was fun while it lasted.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   I'm a guy, so this doesn't happen too often.  Sometimes DJ Laura Z will ask my opinion (and yes, I get the 'is my butt too big in these?' question) but I'm usually pretty straightforward.  I guess I don't remember a time when anyone, Duf included, asked me what I thought of his pants or his haircut.  So, I guess my answer is: when applicable, yes.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   No, not really.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I know I sound like a total nerd, but I think it would be cool to be Neo from the Matrix and just kick all kinds of ass all the time, fly whenever you wanted to, love Carrie Anne Moss down, and hang out with Lawrence Fishburne.  Jesus...who wouldn't want that?     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   There's two.  I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument.  I've got an acoustic guitar in my closet just dying for me to learn how to play it.  I also wish I had the ability to go without sleep for as long as I wanted.  As a busy 30 year old, I find I don't have enough time in each day to get my shit done, so I'd like to chip into my sleep-time hours, with no negative drawbacks and regain that 1/3 of my life that's just being wasted.  Did I mention I don't feel good?  F this...I'm going home.         "
"            Dont Hate  I Was Out of Town   Everyday is Like Sunday 5  by Panda   1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  Climb Mt. Kilimanjaro.  I was supposed to do it on my honeymoon, but we all know how that turned out.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?  I have been accused of being brutally honestbut with hair, outfits, etc, I can be like a guy in that I dont notice subtle differences.  Especially with hair colorwhen Thong was still in the office she was getting her hair highlighted at least every 3 weeks (it was gross) and she  always  asked me if I liked it.  Instead of saying yes or no, I usually told her I couldnt tell.  This was true and not too hurtful (?).  I have had some interesting hairdos over the years, and I usually appreciated peoples commentsunless it was some asshole guy telling me they like girls better with long hair.  Those guys can go to hell.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   A friend once told me how a guy  really  felt about me when we were going out.  This I did  not  need to know.  Does this even answer this question?    Actually, I guess I found out 2 things from this: 1) the person who told me this bit of info is not that great of a friend, and 2) that guy was a total shite.    4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Dylan (Drew Barrymores character) in Charlies Angels.  She kicks ass and looks good doing it.    5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?  To be a psychic would be fantastic, but I wouldnt want to know when people were supposed to die.  Too creepy.          "
"            1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   Skydive.  Thats one.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   Nope.  But I dont feel that Im all-out lying.  If someone gets a perm, I might not like it because I feel that its not my style, but I can appreciate that someone else might like it.  Therefore when I say it looks nice, Im really saying that someone must like it.  But maybe its just not my thing.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Yes  many times.  There are many categories for this.  First off, there are the times that someone tells you something private or secret about another person, and you know that they shouldnt be telling you.  An example would be Jane told me her deepest secret  want to hear what it is??  and it kills you that this person actually tells you.  There are also the times that friends make decisions that you wouldnt make, and all you can do is support them and shut up.  Something like, Im going to invest in Worldcom - I would rather just not know about it.  Yet a third type is when you are told something that puts you in a dilemma  to tell or not tell.  I really dont like those.  Dont tell Jane, but her car is getting towed or Dont tell Jane, but Im about to sleep with her dad.  Alright, so car towing doesnt usually create a morality crisis, but you get the idea.  In case you cant tell, Im not a fan of secrets.  Ignorance is bliss.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I wouldnt mind being Buttercup in the Princess Bride.  Some pretty cool stuff happened in that book.     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   I would love any kind of musical talent (take note, Bassy), be it singing, playing an instrument, conducting, or anything of the like.  Instead, I make mix tapes.          "
"            The FF by BB, yo yo.    1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   Play with a killer band in a sold-out, big huge arena outdoors, like Soldier Field in Chicago. On a more realistic note closer to home, I'd like to play the main room at First Ave.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   No. I try to minimize hurting people's feelings so I try to find something positive and confusing to say. Them: 'Hey do you like my haircut?' Me: 'Haircuts are indicative of change and I find that change in this life is good. Sometimes change can ruin your life for awhile, but most of the time it turns out ok. People can learn a lot about themselves in times of change. You're learning a lot about yourself now.' Hopefully I will have lost their attention by using big words and long sentences, all the while conveying my true feelings about their haircut.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Ok, I've been stuck on this question for like 20 mins now and I've got nothing. If something comes to mind, I'll post it latah.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Since I don't play video games, I'll go for a board game. I would like to live in Candyland. Why? Because everything is sweet and edible and the name rhymes with PANDYLAND! reason enough right there.   5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   3 Way tie: (1) Be a bad-ass volleyball player. (2) I would like to sing so lovely that it brings tears to people's eyes and goose-bumps to their skin. (3) I would like to sweet-talk my way in and out of any sticky situation.          "

"            Once I was out with DJS  By Duf Fer  Lost my login info, but just found it.  What's new?  Here's a blog for my peeps.  Once I was out with DJS and he said that someday, when he has a little critter [or little critters] of his own, he would not mind waking up in the middle of the night for feedings and gentle rockings to sleep.  This is my prayer for  DJS:  that he never actually has to test that statement.  My prayer is that he will have a child [or childrens] that sleeps [be sleepin'] through the night because friends, I am so tired today, my whole body hurts.  Here's how it happened:  TinyE (the pride and joy of Duf and Mrs. Duf), who can now crawl out of her crib,  went to bed around 8:30 .  Duf and Mrs. Duf went to  bed at 11:00 .    Mrs. Duf was reading a thriller by a Scandanavian author who puts the 'er' in thriller.  Duf was working one a poem about elevation from disgrace and despair through the enjoyment of a near perfect plum.    Anyway,  at 1:30 , TinyE woke up and came walking into the marital bedroom where nothing much was going on but a bit of the old in out, in out (known Chez Duf Fer (pronounced 'doo fair') as inhaling and exhaling, also know as catching flies, also known as snoring (for those of you who misunderstood me to reference that wonderful 70s icon  A Clockwork Orange )).  Anyhow, TinyE woke us up, and Mrs. Duf, who does most of the heavy lifting on the graveyard shift (and otherwise) coaxed her back to sleep.    PumpkinCountryBumpkin (also known as TinyE)  woke again at 3:00  and DadDuf did  not get her back to sleep until 3:30 .     At 5:00 , she woke up, and she was done for the night.  I needed her to go  at least until 8:00 .  I  would have taken 7:00 .  I'll admit that  6:00  would not have lead to a blog, but would have allowed for some gripin'.   But 5:00 ?  Ouch friends, ouch.         "
"           Music Competitions have reached a new  urlLink pinnacle .         "
"           Glad to hear y'all had a good time with ColdPlay. So I'm curious about the all-girl 14 yr. old band....were they one of the openers for Coldplay? Why were they horrible? Could they not play their instruments? I'm hoping you will say 'yeah they could play but their songs just weren't for me.' otherwise, I will be disappointed to learn that yet another crappy band is getting good gigs and continuing the perception/belief that female musicians aren't so good on instruments. (It's hard to escape that belief when it's presented to people many times over.) Maybe I need to stop the negativity here and remember what's important....she looks good in a tube top.         "

"            Cold (n' Hot) Play   HAL, I am sorry to break it to you, but that show was all for  me .  I know I told you I had to 'catch a flight' at 4am, but it really was to meet Chris without hurting your feelings.  It's unfortunate you had to find out this way.  Yes, the show was great, but the time we waited before Coldplay came on was clear proof of who were the biggest fans.  We started about 10 layers of people back from the stage when we first arrived at 6:15.  There were 2 (yes, TWO) opening bands before Coldplay finally made its appearance.  What we survived: feeling really, really old; standing for over 3 hours with no water (or BOOZE - it was a 'dry arena'...Duf and I would have downed at least 2 more cosmos otherwise); a weirdo who kept staring (without blinking) at HAL's chest and then asked me about my monkey shirt ('So, what's up with the monkey?'  'Who are you tryin' to get crazy with, ese? Don't you know I'm loco?'); some pot smokers from Sandwich, IL ('I like Jewish ass.'  'Wait, you know  I'm  Jewish.'); a horrible, all-14-year-old girl band called Eisley ('Please visit our website.  Please!'); and lots and lots of sweatiness.  We ended up only 4 people back from the stage once Coldplay started.  It was awesome.  To whoever's foot I totally stomped on while jumping up and down and screaming like a lunatic: I'm  very  sorry, but this ain't Madonna, bitch.          "
"           Hi kids,  I've had a nice collection of days off - over the weekend I was in my friend 'Kat's' adorable wedding.  Though the event was great, being in the small town freaked me out.  I actually saw a bumper sticker that said 'First Iraq, Now France'.  And that's not the only nutso political expression I saw.  Ewwww.  Then on Monday, Duf and I drove to Chi, met up with Panda and spent a couple of beautiful, intimate hours with Chris Martin and his band.  You might know his band as 'Coldplay'.  I know them as 'HAL's Collection of Future Husbands'.  Thanks to Panda's efforts, we were on the floor just a few feet from the stage.  I thought Chris did a great job of playing the show just for me, while not making the rest of the crowd feel completely ignored.  I thought that I did a great job of expressing my enthusiasm, while not earning a restraining order.  Chris is a good guy, and a great dancer.  He wasn't as goofy as he was in Phoenix (no boy-band falsetto impressions this time), but all was forgiven when he got on his guitar and did his 'back and forth' move.  For me.  After the show, we caught a few zzz's before heading back to Minneapolis yesterday.  Panda was again the true trooper - she went to bed at 2, and got up at 4 to catch her plane to NYC.  She's my hero.  I love rock and roll.         "
"            As a tumbleweed rolls past the site known as Pandyland...   I'm listening to the  House Party Motion Picture Soundtrack .  Just thought you might want to know that.   'They come from miles around...to check out the sound.  Watch the walls come tumblin' down...'          "
"            Some Real Characters   T, Nish, and I ran into some total cuckoos over the weekend.  As a quick preface, we went to Capturing the Friedman's on Friday before we hit the bars.  A fascinating documentary, with some twists and turns: at the end you didn't know who to believe.  As an added treat, the director attended our showing for Q&A after the movie.  He originally started filming the documentary with the theme of 'NYC Party Entertainers.'  This turned into something  urlLink he never imagined .  It won the Sundance documentary prize.  See it if you can.  On to the retard recap: 2 fellas came up to T and I in an Irish pub, one of them we called 'Hans without Franz' because he was pumped up, wore a white muscle shirt, and was covered in bling - gold chains, bracelets, and earrings.  Total chach if we ever saw one. His friend who we coined 'St. Matthew', approached us with the line 'I used to be an altar boy at the Catholic school down the street from here.'  How does one respond to this?  We told them both we were lesbian yoga instructors.  This fascinated them to no end.  'So, are you 2 lesbians with  each other ?'  The next place we went to, we were first confronted by a guy who was with a bachelor party; and then dissed by 2 of his friends from the East Coast who attended Yale med school. 'Hey, friends, I want to introduce you to these 3 stunning ladies...'  Yale Asshole: 'Um, don't you see we're having a  conversation ??'  Needless to say, we found out these guys were on a bank role from their rich parents - when you can go to Yale med school w/o student loans, the assumption is you're loaded.  They were assclowns anyway.  At the next bar (yep, we were crawlin'), T ended up talking to a guy I nicknamed 'Sporto Spice.'  He looked like he just got off the soccer field...he had a blue and white jersey and looked like the type who would wear a visor indoors.  He was nice enough to take her drunk ass home.  The next night, after the Yo La Tengo show (killer, btw), we were innocently eating a nice meal at Clarke's diner, when our waitress came over with 2 glasses of milk.  'Those 2 guys over there ordered these for you - they insisted on one chocolate and one plain.  Enjoy.'  When we glanced over at their table, they gave us the ol' 'wink and point.'  Hilarious.  Then a few minutes later they sent over an orange and on their way out of the joint, they stopped by our table to tell us that it was important we consume it. 'The vitamin C in that orange really helps with your stomach enzymes.'  Whatever, dude.  Always a story, friends.  Always a story.  Sometimes I feel like I'm on some fucked up episode of Seinfeld.          "
"            Nigel Update   Nigel is alive and well in Appleton, WI with my 'rents.  He's been staying with them in their guest bedroom since my studio is too small.  I think my mom is getting annoyed with him because he doesn't like her home cooking...either that or the fact that he has a sock in his speedos (mom thinks that's inappropriate).  Since I am moving into my new (bigger) place soon, he will make his return to the big city soon enough.    I will most likely welcome him to Chicago with a doo-rag.  It's an appropriate head covering for summer.         "
"            MIA  Sorry to be outta da loop lately, just busy is all. I must say that I'm lookin good (maybe a little butch?) as a bass fisher-woman. Excellent work, DJS. Weekend was non-eventful. lots of church gigs and I actually rented some movies. Saw 'Catch Me if You Can' and 'Good Girl' Liked them both very much. Catch Me was a fun movie but what I liked most about it is that it's based on true events. Some teenager in the 60s actually posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer & teacher. talk about cahones. It shows what the power of donning a uniform and talking authoritatively can do for you. It's all acting, baby. In the DVD special features, you meet the actual guy who did all of this and listen to him talk about his experiences, I thought it was pretty fascinating because I can't imagine actually doing any of those things. The guy racked up about 5 million in forged checks and bank fraud, landed in jail for about 6 years but has been working for the FBI in catching criminals like himself for the past 20 years and he's paid huge amounts of money to design new security features for check companies. talk about the american dream alive and well.   King Nigel is a great name for your puppy, DJS. Panda and I once had a half-mannequin man named Nigel. He rocked. Dressed in blue speedos and hats that correlated with the seasons. Panda, what happened to poor Nigel?         "
"           Love that.  So great, DJS.         "

"            Well, this just in...   I'm like you Panda, I like giving them real people names.  I had a little dog like the one I'm getting, but he looked more like the Taco Bell dog, just much...much cuter.  One of the original names I threw out was Bill and that got shot down.  Ironically, I just suggested Nigel not too long ago, too.  I like that one too.  Right now, we're both in agreement on  Kenobi .  I'm serious.         "
"            I like King Friday, but how about...   Some dog name suggestions  by Panda  If I'd ever get a dog again (Smokey, RIP ya trooper), I'd name it a ridiculous person name.  For example, the name Clarence always cracks me up.  That and Stanley.  Some others:  Bob Clyde Dennis Dave Miles Ned Cliff Shamus  Nigel Rodney  Caesar Calvin Wolfgang Lamont Harvey Lorenzo Hector Hank  Those are just a few I thought of...there are always more.

"            Didn't Bother With Friday Five...Instead, Here's a Self-Serving Question...     1. If you could pick a name for, say, a small little male dog...what would you name him?  Why?    I'm partial to the name Friday for my dog, but it's getting the thumbs down from my partner in crime.  She wants to call him something like Max or Jake, which I think is too common and not very inspired.   But DJS, why Friday?   The lady we're driving 4 hours into Sconie and 4 hours back from has been calling the little guy 'King.'  Like I mentioned, he's the tiny runt of the litter that only weighed 1 pound a few weeks ago.  Since I think that's kind of cute, I thought I'd combine both King & Friday together.  That makes King Friday, the puppet king in Mister Roger's Neighborhood.  Plus, who wouldn't like a dog named Friday?   'Hey, there's DJS...but what's that creature walking with him?'   'Oh, that's his dog, Friday.'  Am I crazy?  Lemme hear ya Pandylanders!!!  This isn't the kind of post that will do me much good after today!!!  Holla!         "
"            Spanish Villa   I've been cleaning out my apartment tonight (getting ready for the big move, what can I say - I'm a dork.  I plan ahead.).  In my cleaning, I stumbled across some of my old piano music and guitar tablature...specifically the lyrics to a song that was performed by a band Bassy and I were a part of during our good ol' college days.  The name of this band?  '5 Below.'  (There were 5 of us.  Gay, we know.  At least we didn't call ourselves 'Serendipity', one of the other choices.)  Anyway, looking at these lyrics again made me laugh out loud.  The song was written by our good friend Nemo (not to be confused with the new animated Disney character).  I never paid much attention to the meaning of them, but looking at them now, it seems he was having a, shall we say, 'lovers' quarrel' with someone.  The 'Spanish Villa' refers to an apartment building that was close to the UST campus; a building inhabited mostly by college students, in this case - Nemo.  When you read these lyrics, imagine a Spanish-style guitar rhythm.  If I would have had a sombrero at our gig, this song would make dancing around it appropriate.  Here they are [with my comments, of course]:   What will you find? It cannot be alive the anger in your eyes,  For life  [he's pissed!]   I won't even try to understand why these feelings arise,  Again  [doesn't rhyme, but whatever...this was always an awkward stop in the song.]   Chorus:    It comes out at night, right beyond Marshall's lights;  [that would be Marshall Ave. in St. Paul]  It's a fear that I can't control Some things never change, some things I can't do Why don't you just follow your heart?    Leave me here to die  [in front of the Spanish Villa he could have gotten shot, I suppose?]  Just do it polite  [how does one leave someone to die politely?]  Go flee this night You lied  All I can try to believe is my life I didn't try to lie Again  [another awkward pause.]  (Chorus)   It's not a crime to see the signs the anguish in your eyes  [first anger, then anguish in her eyes...this girl is all over the place.]  Tonight  Oh yeah, I tried to be on your side I really did lie Again  [wait, I'm confused.  First he said he didn't try to lie, then he really did?  And she lied too?  Liars!]  (Chorus)  End.  Bow.  Gracias amigos!  Si, si!          "
"           I like small dogs.  It's true.  Panda... why didn't you say you had a pool?  I'm going to visit you ALL THE TIME.  That's sweet!  By the way, have you thought about why you went over there the other night?  I mean seriously... it can't just be the t-shirt and dessert pan.  I have nothing else to say.  Sorry.  But congrats to you two on your recent successes...         "
"           That's a miniature pincher.  Anyone who says: 'That's not a real dog!' gets their teeth kicked in.  I like all dogs, big or small.  Turns out, we live in a townhouse and will stay there for another couple of years.  It would be grossly unfair to have a big dog in a place where we don't even have our own yard.  We haven't thought of a name for him yet.  But yeah, he's tiny.  At eight weeks old, he weighed one pound.  He should top off at a whopping 5-6 pounds.          "
"            It's Official   After 4-1/2 years in the same studio apartment, I'm moving in August!  It's currently a renter's market in Chi, so I took advantage of the good price on a one-bedroom...just down the street from where I am now and still only a block from the lake.  Finally, I will have more space, and can have more than 2 people over at one time.  Plus, there's an indoor pool (not that I'm actually going to use it, but it's a cool thing to have, I suppose).  Another bonus: my apartment number is '311'...like the band.  Won't forget that one.  I'm even thinking of buying a car.  And that's not crazy talk!  Hey DJS, what kind of dog is that?  A Rott puppy?  It looks like the smallest dog ever.  Does he currently work for Taco Bell?         "
"            Contrast to a couple of days ago...   You know how it seemed like my day was shit on Tuesday?  It's amazing what another 24 hours or so can do.  Firstly, I've been working like a madman to get the editing on my 2nd book done.  I'm making huge strides and I'm like halfway done, methinks.  I've set somewhat unrealistic goals to reach every week and amazingly, I've been able to meet them.  (pat on back)  If all goes well, I should have a readable version of my latest and greatest to share with my eager readers.  On top of that, I've been continuing correspondence with a children's author who has been giving me all kinds of leads and the 'go-ahead' to drop his name when writing to agents.  Keep them fingers crossed, kids.  Secondly...remember how I was going to be a goddamned hero and join the fire department on an on-call basis?  Well, I had an interview a couple of weeks ago and I thought it went well.  They told me that they'd contact me in the next week if they were interested in bringing me to stage 2.  A week went by, then another.  After my softball game last night, I got the mail and saw a letter from the city of Woodbury.  Shit.  I cracked it open and was ready to say 'Goddammit' when I discovered it was letting me know that I made it to stage 2 and that I had to go to a meeting next week.  Yeah!  Thirdly...I'm in the worst physical shape I've ever been in.  EVER!  To combat that, I'm going back to kickboxing.  I've worked out a schedule that allows me to workout just about everyday and not disrupt my normal schedule too much.  This probably seems lame to most, but I've been yearning to get back in the ring and knock some suckas out.  My new regimen starts next week, yo.  Fourthly - We get to go and pick this little guy up on Saturday:     Anyway...that's my good news this week.   'Everyone knows these are rock hard times...'          "

I hate myself for it, but I'm growing, learning, yearning to become better at not doing that so much.  So...my plan was to drive back from Mankato 1.5 hours in time to rendezvous with you cats at the agreed-upon location.  I've worked it out with the missus and I think we've reached a compromise we can all live with.  However, if Friday the 20th would work for everyone else, that would save me an extra trip and make everyone happy.  Plus...isn't it better to get your driggity-drink on Friz-i-day?  Methinks so...  As for the Eels concert, there's not way around it.  I've paid for portion of the cabin and it's too damn far to justify driving back and forth to see E and the crew.  Damn me.  Damn everything.

But seriously, how would Friday, June 20th work for you?  Better?  I, too, have been delirious about the concerts I've attended this year/will be attending.  Tori Amos in Mad City (w/Ben Folds in August), Coldplay (seeing 'em again w/ Duf and Hal on Monday - ow!), Yo La Tengo this weekend, Wilco at Summerfest...oh, my spinning head.  DJS, I, too, can feel your bliss.  Duf, I'm shocked and disappointed that you would think I could ever demote you to lame-o status.  I'm not lying when I say your lifestyle is one I long for.  Toenail clippings and all, I want to have a family eventually.  But I am also not ready to have that with just anyone.  God knows I could have had it all last November.  What I'm saying is, the 'thrill-a-minute' you describe can get old.  But I enjoy it while I can...and will make sure you do a shot with me at PBJ3 (and perhaps before the big show).  And then I will put you in a cab and make fun of you behind your back.  BB, don't worry, be happy.  Worrying gives you wrinkles, sweetheart.  Hal, to answer your sarcastic question, I'm definitely not inviting Ian to the show, especially since we just had this discourse over e-mail:  'How are you?'  'I'm fine.'  'Just out of curiousity...have you figured out why you came over on Saturday night?'  'I wanted my stuff.'  'Are you sure that's all?'  'Please don't e-mail me or call me anymore.  Thanks.'

"            Happy...then Sad.   It's a great day here in the land o' DJS.  I got past what I thought would be a difficult assignment here at work with little or no difficulty and more importantly I was able to sneak out to Electric Fetus to pick up the the EELS album 'Shootenanny!'  {Duf - I tried to call and see if you'd join me.  Alas...twas not to be}  Best part?  It came with a free 4-song EP if you bought it at one of 3 special locations.  Yes!!!  Then came the even better news: the EELS are going to be playing a show at First Avenue on July 22nd!  This is the best day of my life!!!  I'm not a huge concert goer, but I've been known to make it to shows that literally will stop your heart had you been to them.  Seeing one of my all-time favorite bands in the world in a small, intimate venue is like the prequel to what will be a legendary journey to see Ms. Bjork in Colorado.  But I digress...  This has the potential to be an even bigger concert year for me than last year when I saw a veritable ass-pocket of great shows.  Then, the bomb hits:  I'm going to be out of town on 7.22.03, spending a week with my fiance and her family up north in a cabin, some 6-7 hours away from the stage where Mark Oliver Everett, Kooool G Murder, Butch and the rest will be rocking the place to rubble.  Stop the bus.  I'm getting off.         "

"            An Interesting Turn of Events   I was hanging out with some friends on Saturday night at Avenue Tavern...K turned into a drunk lame-o and had to be put in a cab and taken home.  I still wanted to stop by MM's on my way home so I went in, got a free shot from my friend Doug, and sat down next to a nerdy looking guy...I asked Doug to get a shot for him too.  Turned out, this guy was a physicist from Germany who just moved from Southern France to Chicago to work for the Department of Energy.  He was interesting, but I wasn't attracted to him in the least...just nice to talk to (and I had to share my shoddy German with him - knowing how to say 'You asshole, go home' auf Deutsche always gets a few laughs).  Well, of course, with him being of the male-asshole-persuasion, he thought this was his cue to get a little touchy feely.  Oh Jesus.  When he excused himself to go to the bathroom, I used the opportunity to get the hell out of there.  I just didn't want to deal.  On my way home, I got a random call from my ex, Ian.  This couldn't get any weirder.  I asked him where he was, he said he was at Nick's Uptown.  I asked him if he was alone, he said he was.  I told him I'd be there in 5 minutes.  This visit with him was going to be strictly selfish on my part - for those of you in the know, he's had some stuff of mine that he's been promising to give back to me, and I intended to get it back that night.  No hanky-panky would be involved. Just an exchange of goods (well, maybe just a one-way exchange).  I saw him, we made small talk, blah, blah...   Here's our conversation, edited as not to completely bore you: Me: 'When can I get my shit?'   Dumbass: 'I've been meaning to give it to Anu.'  Me: 'Yeah, I hear you've been giving her other things as well.' [Closed circuit: he kissed my friend Anu a week after we broke up.  Whatever.]   Dumbass: 'But it was totally innocent...[insert other lame excuses here]'   Me: 'I don't care.  We're going to your place and I'm getting my stuff.'   Dumbass: 'So do you want to go out again sometime?' Me: 'You gotta be kidding me.'  When we got to his place, he gave me my stuff, and then asked if I wanted to stay for a bottle of wine.  What version of 'NO' don't you understand, friend?  I told him I'd see him around and left immediately.  I hope I didn't just open up a can of worms.  But it was all worth it, because I got  urlLink this  back.  Amen.          "

I'd like to be remembered as someone who is a bona fide 'good guy' that will hopefully encompass my role as husband, father, grandpa, brother, son, you name it.  When I'm gone, I want people to go: 'Remember DJ Shovelpants?  Yeah, he was one of the good ones.  Damn I miss him and his smart mouth.'    A close 2nd would be to have people remember me by my work, and by work I mean my writing, and by writing I mean the stuff that I've been writing for the kids.  You know how I do.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?  Off the cuff: 'As soon as you're born you start dying, so you might as well have a good time.' - Cake   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?  I'm proud that I've finally found the one person on this planet who I love unconditionally.  Turns out, I'm doubly lucky that I also get to marry this woman in less than a year.    A close 2nd would be the completion of my 2nd novel.  Turns out I really do have a knack for this writing thang...   4. What about the past ten years?  Not sure this qualifies, but I guess that my biggest achievment in the last decade would be getting rid of all the things that held me back over the years: friends who were the equivalent of bags of shit on legs, my cold-hearted non-supportive ex-wife, all the scary, scary ex-girlfriends I've dated, and the attitude that I should just give up on the dreams I've always had and just to get in line with everyone else.  Forget that noise.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   'That's the way it goes sometimes, but just remember it goes the other way too.'  (I think that was from 'True Romance')         "

She has told me stories about when she would go to mass during grade school, and if a girl happened to forget her mass veil, she would have to wear a Kleenex on her head (wouldn't want any hair to show - sinful!).  Needless to say, I was brought up in the Catholic tradition as well.  Catholic grade school, college, AND grad school - the whole nine yards.  I was a bit of a 'talker' during my grade school years (shocker) and got smacked upside the head more than a few times by some crotchety old nuns after getting caught 'talking to my neighbor' during class. (Side note: why do grade school teachers always refer to your other classmates as 'your neighbors'? ie: 'Don't look at your neighbor's test' or 'Pass the papers back to your neighbor.'  Weird.)  So I've been packing for my big move this week, and have stumbled across various things I've forgotten about: old letters, funny pictures, and...old school 'prayer cards' that I've collected during my Catholic school years.  I've decided to keep one of them in my wallet for good karma: St. Jude, The Patron Saint of Hopeless Cases.  Because things have gotten kind of hopeless around here, I need all the help I can get.  'Pray for me who am so needy...'         "
"            A Pet Peeve leads to the Tuesday One   My biggest pet peeve:  guys who don't get out of their seats on public transportation for old people, disabled people, or pregnant women.  This morning a woman got on the bus who must have been  at least  8 months pregnant.  She looked as if the baby was going to pop out at any second.  She had to walk all the way to the back of the bus until she got to my seat, and I got up so she could sit down.  She probably passed about 10 men who paid absolutely no attention to this poor woman.    My question to y'all: Is Chivalry Dead?  I'm afraid, in this hardened city, it is.         "
"            Addicting Link O' the Day   I don't know where this came from, but I was totally engrossed for a good 20 minutes.   urlLink Very cool puzzle-type game .  And no...it's not one of those stupid shoot the blocks or ball games that everyone here at work plays.         "
"            What Time Is It?   This sounds like a fairly easy question.  Unless you asked me that about 1 hour ago.  We just upgraded our computers at work, and with the upgrade came some problems - namely, that the time (located at the bottom right corner of most PCs) was set to NYC (Eastern Standard) time.  I'm home an hour early and didn't even mean to do it.  Yay me!  Let's hope  urlLink this  doesn't happen to me tomorrow.         "
"            The Truth  By Duf Fer  I really don't have any feelings about the Liz Phair album one way or another.  I am just hurting because Bob Hope is dead, and I needed to lash out.  I'm sorry.         "
"            Steamin' Mad At Dirt   I'll fight the both of you.  How dare you not like something that I enjoy?  I jest and I'm definitely going to let it go.  There's no point in trying to convince you of Liz's merits if you've already branded the album as horrible.  I don't agree, but I'd be wasting my time if I tried to outline a convincing argument about how y'all are just wrong, wrong, wrong...  For the record, my favorite Liz Phair album is 'Whip Smart.'  I remember seeing the video for 'Supernova' where Lizzie is wearing a motorcycle helmet and playing the guitar like it's going out of style.  She won me over forever during that video because, despite what all of her nay-sayers (not you guys in particular) she came off as someone that definitely doesn't take herself too seriously.  Gotta like that.           "
"            My 0.02   First impression - any song (with the probable exception of 'Lil' Digger' and 'H.W.C.') coulda been a track on the next Britney/Xtina/Avril/Pink CD.  It's true.  That said, I wouldn't feel let down if Britney/Xtina/Avril/Pink sang the same songs, because that's all they can do.  However, I think we all know that Ms. Phair can do better.  And has done better.         "
"            I Should Let it Go  By Duf Fer  Your point is a pretty good one as far as it goes.  You have to recognize 'Exile in Guyville' for what it was though (a rebuttal to the Rolling Stones's 'Exile on Main Street').  Divorced from that context, then smut just seems like smut.  Consider 'Whip Smart.'  Consider 'whitechocolatespaceegg.'  'Exile in Guyville' was fresh and a good idea well executed.  Liz's new idea is 'sell more records.'  Not only that, it's not well executed.  It's a bad idea, badly done.    Also, I have oodles of albums that are wildly popular.  I like thin pop music (you can't beat the Go Gos for that), and I like complex stuff that is seen by many as inaccessible (The Sonic Youth is probably the most widely known example).    Look, Liz can do whatever the hell she wants.  The bottom line is that if you are John Updike and your next book comes out and it's John Grisham, people are going to completely demolish you by evaluating you in light of your past efforts.   I don't over value producers either.  Hey, it's all good.  One of Liz's other producers works with Pete Yorn, and I dig his stuff immensely.  But if you are Liz, and your start thinking I want the producer to change my sound so that I can sell more records, you have to know you are going to take some knocks for that.  Of course, if you are Justin Timberlake, you really need N*E*R*D.  Ask yourself this though:  is there a consistent musical thread on this disc?  Can you see a dramatic difference between tracks based on who is producing?  What does that say about the source of the art?  Is is Liz, or is it her label?  Is she trying to save her contract or what?    For me, what this argument comes down to is this:  there is a whole wide world of pop music with texture and flair and (yes) mass appeal (I think Madonna qualifies here, and I would add Maxwell, there are many, many others).  One can be popular and widely enjoyed without being shitty.  Liz, in an effort to reach more people, dumbed down and simplified and changed her sound and it was so foreign to her that she cannot convince anyone who knows her that this is what is within her, that this is the reflection of some burning internal drive.  In short, she's completely lost, adrift.  She has no clue what she is doing, and it shows on the disc.  Look, I still listen to my copy of 'Like a Virgin' from time to time. There is something there that is worth returning too, and you can't get more calculated for mass appeal than that.  I will leave my argument to this. If you still listen to this new Liz Phair CD even a year from now, I will eat her nasty underwear and say it's my 'favorite.'         "
"            The Following Post Is Rated R...you've been warned.   Okay, I wanted to stay out of this but here's a comparison for ya.   Flower  is taken from Liz Phair's 'Exile in Guyville.'  I'll also include the lyrics to  'H.W.C'  from her self-titled and much bally-hooed self-titled effort.   Flower    Everytime I see your face I get all wet between my legs Everytime you pass me by, I heave a sigh of pain  Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you and your minions, too Your face reminds me of a flower Kind of like you're underwater Hair's too long and in your eyes Your lips a perfect 'suck me' size You act like you're fourteen years old Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, true and mean I want to be your blowjob queen You're probably shy and introspective That's not part of my objective I just want your fresh, young jimmy Turning, slamming, ramming in me Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you till your dick is blue  Everytime   And now, for your comparison pleasure, here are the lyrics for  'H.W.C.'    H.W.C.    Give it to me, don't give it away Don't think about what the others say My skins getting clear, my hairs so bright All you do is fuck me every day and night  You're my secret beauty routine Na, na, na, na, what my body has seen I am lookin' good and I'm feeling nice Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  I'm gonna pull you back down between the sheets Everything is fresher when the day is sweet In the morning light when you're already on the phone  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life So hot, so sweet, so wet my appetite  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Your hot white cum.   Personally, I think the lyrics in 'Flower' are a bit more carnal and smutty than the lyrics of 'H.W.C.'  I'd be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with me.  So she says 'cum' a couple times.  No big deal.  My two cents:  I can't and won't limit myself to the music (books & movies) I enjoy solely by their artistic merit.  I can't.  I had a friend growing up (and I'm not making parallel comparisons, please don't think that's my intent) who did that to the point where it bordered on ridiculous.  If a CD he purchased sold more than 10,000 copies, it was immediately brought to Cheapo (where they don't give you much for CDs.  Might I suggest BookSmart or Half-Price Books?).  The reason being?  He didn't want his collection tainted with music that was considered popular or loved by the masses.  He has over 1,000 CDs in his collection and you'd be lucky to find 50 that you recognize.  Like Panda, I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion.  There's no point in it.  You either dig something, or you don't.  For me, I like Liz Phair's new album.  Do I love it?  No, but I don't hate it either.  To me, it doesn't seem like she's thrown all of her old tricks away to completely sell out.  Not at all.  Yeah, she's trying to reach a new audience and there's always that risk of alienating your old fans.  I read somewhere that she recorded a few albums between this one and 'whitechocolatespaceegg' that she absolutely hated and scrapped completely, never to see the light of day.  I'm sorry, but I like me some variety.  If you were to go through my CD collection, bookshelves, and wall of DVDs I think you'd see a pretty broad cross-section of titles.  I can't overly concern myself with what is too commercial, too popular or what lacks artistic merit.  It's too limiting for me.  I like really shitty movies and I like ones that are though-provoking and make the hair on my arms stand up.  Same goes with music.  I can't concern myself with who produced what track and what their motivations were for doing so.  If Liz wanted The Matrix to produce a couple of tracks to give her sound a more wide appeal, then so be it.  I could care less that he produced Avril Lavigne's album.  So what?  That seems to be a foothold for most of the critics of Liz's new album.  Well, does that mean I should hate one of my favorite groups N.E.R.D. because the people in the group produced Justin Timberlake's album or a song or two for Britney Spears?  Nope.  Okay...this became a rant without me wanting it to be, but let me close with saying that I'm not absolutely in love with the new Liz Phair CD, but I like it well enough that I'm looking forward to seeing her perform again with some friends.  I've read plenty of reviews of her album and none of them (save for People magazine) have been favorable.  The bottom line is: it's not art and I don't think it's pretending to be.  It's just a different direction for an artist that people were expecting more (of the same) from.          "
"            There's Change and then There's Change  By Duf Fer  Here's my point:  artists have to evolve over time, but evolution should reflect artistic growth.  If U2 reproduced their 'Boy' sound over and over, it would get tedious after 20 years.  Radiohead has changed and evolved over the years too.  'Pablo Honey' sounds different from 'Hail to the Theif,' but you recognize both as Radiohead.  What Liz did is change  genres .  She went from alt rock to pop.  That is a huge change.  She went from the company of Patti Smith and PJ Harvey (artists) to the company of Avril Levigne and Christina Aguilera (marketers).  She has dumbed her lyrics down to the point that I don't even recognize her (compare the lyrics of F*** and Run from Exile in Guyville (with their capacity to surprise and educate) to the banal lyrics of H.W.C. (nothing but smut) on this new piece of trash CD and you will see what I mean.  Change is inevitable.  Degradation could be avoided.  If the hiatus left her with nothing to say, better to fall silent; I'm all for single mom's providing for their illegitimate children, but I also hate to see an artist become a marketer and Liz Phair used to be about something besides making money.           "
"            I'm Not Here to Change Anyone's Mind   So I'm not going to try, but didn't we  just  talk about respecting a band's desire to change?  Whether you think Liz has changed for the better or for the worst, she is evolving in some way.  If y'all wanted Exile in Guyville Part Deux, it's just not going to happen. (Kind of like how I wanted The Bends Revisited.)  Here's a single mom, looking as HOT as ever, singing dirty lyrics, and, after 5 years of being on the sidelines, she's playing SOLD-OUT shows again.  If I hear one more person say she's 'sold out' I think I'm going to puke.  After more than 10 years in the biz, she still has ambitions - commercial ones at that.  I say more power to her.  But I have to admit, I'm not going to her show - primarily because I know with her new sound (and the fact that her songs are played on  urlLink 'The Eric and Crappy Show' ) the venue will be filled with  urlLink these girls .  In other news: I take the bus to work everyday and pass the park across the street from my house.  There are always a few bums laying around underneath the trees, catching some zzz's.  Well, I've been noticing this one bum who has been there for the last few mornings.  I think he might be dead... What I should do is go over by him and poke him with a stick, just to be sure.          "
"            Blasphemy!   I'm back, kids.  And wow...I had no idea Duf's despise for Liz's new effort ran so deep.  Well, diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks, I guess.  You'll be missed at the show, yo.         "
"            Liz Sucks but Doesnt Swallow  By Duf Fer   I have a dilemma:   A group of friends and I are planning to go to the Liz Phair show in Minneapolis on August 28th.  I bought a ticket at the oh so nice price of $15.  On my recent trip to Birmingham, I forgot to pack CD's, so I bought the new Liz Phair disc (and the new Annie Lennox disc) at the Atlanta airport (the prices were not so bad really).  Pause for a CD memory:   CD memory:   My preference is to buy only one CD at a time.  It gives me a chance to fully listen to the CD without the pressure of checking out two discs at once.  I almost never follow this rule, but I often try.  Every once in awhile, I will get two discs at once and they will both blow me away.  One example that comes to mind is that I bought Billy Bragg and Wilco's Mermaid Avenue and the Putamayo disc Memphis to Mali An African American Odyssey on the same trip - both are certified Duf' platinum.  Back to the dilemma:   The dilemma:   I hate the new Liz Phair CD.  Honestly, I have not had such a strong negative reaction to a disc since, well, ever.  It is absolutely horrible.  I like 'Extraordinary' well enough as a forgettable pop song (produced by The Matrix of Avril Levigne fame  why would an established artist like Liz Phair want to emulate Avril Levigne?), and Love/Hate conjures up the Liz of old, but the rest of the disc is borderline deplorable.  There are moments that are desperate like 'Favorite' and there are moments that are sick.  'H.W.C,' which stands for hot white cum 'give me your hot, white cum' is the easiest example (she plans to use it for healthy skin by the way).  Now, before you label Duf a prude, let me say that I have plenty of dirty discs.  No problem there.  In college, I had a copy of the Too Live Crew's uberdirty album Too Live is What We Are, and I dug it for a long time.  You said it yourself, you like it like I do ah memories.  Now I may seem like a sexist - how can I own a bunch of dirty discs and give Liz a hard time for being candid?  Well, its because I also own 'Exile in Guyville' and 'Whip Smart.' I even have 'whitechocolatespaceegg.' All three discs are quite candid and frank in sexual conversations, all are thick with smart music and some pop sensibility but mostly  all three discs are thick with clever lyrics .  Somehow, none of those discs are crass and vulgar.  I just don't believe that Liz feels this way.  I think she is adapting her style to sell records (and she has said as much).    The two things I like most in music are passion and honesty.  People ask me how I can love Vladimir Horowitz and Sonic Youth with equal devotion, it is because the one thing you cannot deny is that they are sincere and passionate.  They really feel what they are expressing.  It makes their art pure.  Its like going to a KoKo Taylor show.  You know that she is singing from her soul. She sings because she is a singer; she could not care less if singing made her a millionaire or the poorest woman in Chicago.  One the other hand, Liz Phair is trying to make some extra money by being dirty and applying formulas, and her impurity has corrupted the entire disc.  Its trash.  I will be at Cheapo before the sun sets.  Also, I'll take my ticket to the show and sell it to someone who would like to see her.  I ain't the one.          "
"            Friday 5 to Make Up for Lack of Posts   Sorry, I've been busy in NYC.     1. What were your favorite childhood stories?  I loved 'Goodnight Moon', 'The Story of Ferdinand', 'Corduroy', 'Eloise', and 'The Snowy Day.'  I always thought Dr. Suess books were weird and I think the illustrations scared me.   2. What books from your childhood would you like to share with [your] children?  All of them...I can't wait to read to my future kids.  My mom read to us very early which had 2 results: 1) for me, I learned to read by age 4, and 2) it made my brother hate reading.  So I guess it's a crap-shoot.   3. Have you re-read any of those childhood stories and been surprised by anything?  'Goodnight Moon' is pretty boring now.  I probably just liked the pictures when I was little...it's definitely a baby book - for kids 3 and under.   4. How old were you when you first learned to read?  oh, I guess I mentioned this before - 4.   5. Do you remember the first 'grown-up' book you read? How old were you?  I don't remember the 'first' grown-up book I read, but I remember really enjoying 'The Secret Garden' when I was in 2nd Grade.  I loved the fantasy in it, and when Mary finally finds the sick boy in the house and takes him outside.  They turned the book into  urlLink a movie  in 1993, and it was so fascinating for me to watch because a lot of the scenes (the house, garden, etc) looked exactly how I had pictured them in my head.          "
"            I'm a sexist pig?   First off, true sharing - like many women (back me up, BB and Panda!) I go to a fancy salon and pay a lot of money to 'professionals' who smear hot wax on my unwanted hair for the purpose of violently ripping the hair out by the roots.  For the most part, I reserve this pleasant experience for the hair around my eyes, commonly referred to as the 'eyebrows'.  This is a semi-regular thing for me, and in the few years I've been having this done, I have always had the service performed by females.  When I made an appointment at the usual place, I was informed that 'David' will be waxing me today.  I think that David is a man.  I'll be honest - I'm worried.  Unlike a bad haircut/dye job/manicure, you can't just cover up a poorly done eyebrow wax.  If it's crooked, or say, they remove your entire eyebrow altogether (!!!), you can't just cover it up or pull it back into a ponytail.  I hope this 'David' person knows what he's doing, and doesn't have a thing for  urlLink Marlene Dietrich ...  Agh!         "

"            I Meant to do this Friday 5 Last Week   So here goes:   1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  Amy T.  She lived down the street from me and we went to the same Catholic grade school together.  We were always doing stupid stuff, but what I remember most is riding bikes.  Remember riding bikes ALL THE TIME, when you were little?  That was so great.  I had a yellow banana seat Schwinn.  With a basket.  And we really loved stickers.  I have to admit, that was pretty lame.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  Unfortunately, not.  When we got to Junior High age, my family moved and we both went to different schools on opposite sides of the city.  We ended up going to the same high school 3 years later, but it definitely wasn't the same.  We both had different friends by then and just ended up saying 'hi' to each other if we saw one another in the hall.  It was kind of sad.  I know she's married now and lives in Wisconsin, so that's cool.  The only reason I know this is because I have a very nosy mother who keeps up with these things...   3. Do you have a current close friend?  In addition to my close friends in Minneapolis, my best friend in Chicago is Ms. T.  She's my partner-in-crime.  We go drinking together, pick up men together, and generally get in trouble together.  She's been in Guatemala for the last 3 weeks on vacation, and I've missed her terribly.  When we're both in town, we don't go a day without talking...at least a couple times.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  We were in a class in Thailand together.  I actually thought she was a ditzy, snob-and-a-half party girl when we were there and didn't really hang out with her.  Not until we got back and took our last MBA class together (and were in the same final business plan group) did we hit it off.  Kind of weird.  Just goes to show how you should give people the benefit of the doubt.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Jenny G. from High School.  She was my best friend junior and senior year and really opened my eyes up to different (make that, fun) things.  The first time I got drunk was with her.  We used to go to her house during our lunch hour (she lived across the street) and she'd smoke pot...one weekend we made a trip to Madison for 'Harvest Fest' to hear speeches on legalizing pot or wearing hemp clothing.  (I was very innocent, so this seemed like a huge deal to me.)  Her and her parents (professors) were uber-liberal, opening up my then close-mindedness towards other political and social issues.  She was an all-around cool and interesting person.  I recently e-mailed her out of the blue by getting her e-mail from classmates.com, but haven't followed up with a phone call.  Maybe I'll do that soon...            "
"            Friday Five  By Duf Fer   1. When was the last time you cheated?  On Monday.  DJS and I took a co-worker out for a burrito lunch.  DJS ordered a burrito with extra chicken and received extra chicken.  However, we were not charged for extra chicken and I knew it.  So, I cheated Chipotle out of $1.50 worth of chicken.   2.

However, we were not charged for extra chicken and I knew it.  So, I stole $1.50 worth of chicken from Chipotle.   3. When was the last time you lied?  In a post earlier this week, I lied about the size of my loins.   4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?  I broke a china plate at my in-law's house, while kissing ass by washing dishes.  The hard to replace plate was found on e-Bay along with additional pieces that were missing from their set.  They ended up thanking me for inspiring them to complete their set.   5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?  Mrs. Duf and I had another argument two nights ago ('tis the season?).  She looked hurt at one point.  The only details I can offer are that we are working on a project and had some third party advice that I see as having general value, but that she sees as having specific value.  In disagreeing with her, I think I was too aggressive and logical and indirectly (and without intending to do so), dismissive of her view.          "

"            I'm learning a lot.   When you agree to buy a place, you have to sign a lot of things.  I know, I know, 'just wait until you close'... anyway, I had to sign like 15 places, to verify that I am aware that I can look up the location of registered level 3 sex offenders online.  (Insert your own Panda's-latest-boyfriend joke here)  I wasn't too interested in this info, as it's considered unreliable (people move and don't register like they're supposed to) and all offenders had a first time offense, before which there would be no online listing.  Curiosity got the best of me, so I went to  urlLink the address , and typed in my new zip code.  Nothing.  Then my current zip code.  Nothing.  Then the zip code for my parents, and you guessed it, nothing.  Finally I entered the zip where my two nieces (ages 9 and 2),  and newphew (age 8) live (along with a new kid to be delivered in November).  Five offenders.  Great.  I knew it was the 'hood, but reading what put these dudes in prision makes the 'hood feel less 'ghetto couch on the front porch' and more 'violent rape attack on unsuspecting victim'.  Too much information.         "

"            Me, an Interpreter?   Duf, I'm not quite sure I want to be the future interpreter of all things Family Duf.  Especially if the end result is you ending up on the Barcalounger/Lazy-Boy/Sectional/Davenport.  (GASP - I  said  the 'D' word.)  (Side note: you sleeping on the Barcalounger gives you something in common with my little brother.  During Summerfest weekend, my little bro ended up on the Barcalounger in our hotel room on one drunken evening.  But this is only because his wife passed out in bed with me, and he didn't want to share a bed with Hal.  Who could blame him?  She snores.)  So all this Radiohead babble is getting a little exhausting.  DJS, I sold  Pablo Honey .  Deal with it.  I just have bad memories with that album and it was more of a cathartic thing than anything.  And like I care what some clown making minimum wage at Cheapo thinks?  Let's talk about something new...like Liz Phair's new masterpiece.  She sold out?  Who cares...her songs still (esp. H.W.C.) speak to me.  Her lyrics are still dirty, dirty, dirty.  Isn't that all that counts?  As y'all said about Radiohead, I much prefer to be surprised and entertained and enjoy an artist's changes over time.          "

It may be our last chance.  We may have to search for other musical common ground if you persist in your communistic refusal to embrace the movement.  2.  Phoebe Cates is 40 today.  I heard it on NPR.  [Pause for Fast Times at Ridgemont High flashback].  3.  PB:  my wife, upon reading your post about 'things are going to have to change around here', thinks you are a goddess (I told her you were not a goddess; she said she hated me and made me sleep on the couch).  Anyway, I may call on you as an interpreter during future altercations.         "
"            Radiohead Y'all...   Yeah, the new Radiohead album isn't my favorite of theirs, I'll admit.  But damn if it doesn't do something to me!  My first listen I was kind of like 'Okay, I know these guys know what the hell they're doing, but this needs to grow on me, yo.'  And it did.  Like a rash...but one of those rashes you don't mind so much.  You know the kind...  I've lost you, haven't I?  First of all, I'm having a hard time believing anyone could sell  Pablo Honey .  What?  That's like an essential rock album.  Yeah, they played the piss out of 'Creep' on the radio, but still...there's tons and tons of delicious musical nuggets to be ingested.  I can't even imagine the look on the person's face  at the 2nd hand CD store when that album ends up in the 'I-want-to-sell-these pile.'   'What?  You're actually getting rid of this?  For $3?'  To each their own, I guess.  (Panda, you're crazy.  That's all I'm sayin'.)  Like Duf sez:  It's hard to rank these albums.  Each of them is different to me.  Yeah, there are threads of their previous effort woven into each one, but they are definitely stand-alone works that can't be ignored.  Here goes...  1. Kid A 2. OK Computer 3. Pablo Honey 4. Amnesiac 5. Hail To The Thief 6. The Bends  I know, it's probably blasphemy to cite  'The Bends'  as my least favorite, but as mentioned in previous posts (Duf's namely) this isn't to say I think it's a shitty album.  They all get top marks in my book and admittedly, I jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon with  'OK Computer.'   A lot of my rankings have to do with where I was in my life at the time the albums came out.  When I get a new Radiohead CD I tend to listen to it to death and I found myself listening to Kid A probably the most.  Interesting side note: I was planning on writing a book (a mystery/thriller-type) while listening to Radiohead.  I wanted to set kind of a dark, strange tone in my narrative.  I wrote 16 pages of it and thought it sucked.  Oh well, it was worth the try.         "
"            Do I get the Boot?    I have never listened to a Radiohead album and am not a fan. *GASP* Don't hate.  Congrats to Hal on the new pad!

"            My Radiohead Rankings  by PB   1) The Bends 2) The Bends 3) The Bends 4) OK Computer 5) Hail to the Thief   My copy of The Bends was signed by the band (including the most impish, googly-eyed lead singer in existence, Thom Yorke) at the Let It Be record store in Minneapolis after their show at First Ave.  This album will always be special to me, not just because it was signed, but because I had a truly spiritual experience at that show.  (Picture being literally lifted off your feet by the pulsating crowd during the song  Black Star .)  Plus, it's a great album to put on for a little 'Uszzzzzsh', if you know what I mean. (OK Computer has some ussszzzzsh factor, too.)    I sold my copy of Pablo Honey, and after listening to Amnesiac and Kid A several times in the record store, I couldn't buy them.  Sorry, Duf.    Conflict is good.          "
"           No roses, but I did buy myself a condo today (in St. Paul for those interested, in Highland Park for the nosy).

And as a bonus, I get covered parking and a slightly smaller commute.  It's all very adult.         "
"            Oh No...A Conflict in the 'Land!   I love the new Radiohead album.  If you compare it to 90% of the stuff out there, you have to admit it is art.  If you compare it to past Radiohead, you may not love it the most.    Still, I like it as a complete work, but I also really like a lot of the songs.  Namely:  '2+2=5', 'Sit Down Stand Up', 'Go to Sleep', 'There There' (the one that is getting airplay) and 'Myxomatosis'.  But the one song that makes the whole album is 'Where I End and You Begin' ('I will eat you alive' - indeed).  If you don't like that track, then you don't like Radiohead.  The bass (BB take note) at the beginning is everything:  sex, truth, God, art, poetry, literature, drugs, pain, redemption and dishonesty.  As I listen to the entire album, I feel like I get their meaning.    DJS and I went lunch with this cool guy NeB, and he said something that I think is spot on.  No two Radiohead albums are really alike.   Pablo Honey  and  The Bends  are pretty close, and obviously there are similarities between  Kid A  and  Amnesiac , but other than that, they have changed quite a bit.  I like  Hail to the Thief  almost as much because it can stand on its own as a bold musical statement and because it represents a variation on the theme that makes Radiohead what it is:  evolution and change.  You either like that they change from album to album a lot, or you don't.  It can be maddening after a flawless album like  The Bends  when you feel like you could love many albums almost just like it, but then you would never get an  OK Computer  if they always stuck with that The-Bends sound.    And now, without further adieu, here is my ranking of Radiohead (studio) albums:  1.   OK Computer  2.   The Bends  3.   Kid A  4.   Pablo Honey  5.   Hail to the Thief  6.   Amnesiac   The main thing is this:  there is not one on the list that I would not give an 'A' rating.  In fact, I love them all. The difference between the rankings is so slight that I almost could not do it.  A year from now, I might have them all inverted.  Anyway, what are your Radiohead rankings Pandylandaz?          "

I love this record and her attitude about making it.  The cover art and her explanation was particularly intriguing to me: 'I am not a young artist in their early twenties.  I am a mature woman facing up to the failed expectations of life and facing up to 'core' issues.  I don't want to represent myself visually in some kind of cliched, airbrushed, saccharine kind of way.'  Go, Annie.         "
"            My First Guess   Duf, as a woman with (fairly) normal womanly traits, I know how we have tendencies to express something (perhaps very strongly), while actually being concerned about something totally different.  Here's what I think is happening: Mrs. Duf is frustrated.  She's under a lot of pressure and as a modern woman, has taken on many roles: 1) Super Mom, 2) Career Woman, 3) Wifey of Duf Fer.  Personally, I think there is more pressure on the woman to be  perfect  at all Three.  Men can slack a bit on #1 or #3 and get away with it because 'they're bringing home the bacon'.  Of course, this is crap, but society (or the horrid media) dictates this.  (Another reason I still wish it were the 50s.)  So when Mrs. D says 'things need to change around here'...you may think she's talking about the order of the house. (Men tend to take things more literally than women.) However, I think she just wants you to be aware that she's going to need your support.  Not just with the vacuuming or putting Tiny E to bed, but emotionally as well.  She needs to know you'll be around to pick up the slack.  Also, you traveling a lot probably makes the Mrs worried about things falling behind at home.  Talk to her and tell her what you told us in your post.  I'm sure she's more concerned with the cleanliness of your relationship than with the bathroom.  Convince her that you have her back...  But again, this is just my guess.         "
"            Garbage & Small Shameless Plug   Friends in Christ and/or Pandylandaz,  Don't forget to take the garbage out.  Let me add to that.  Don't forget to take the garbage out, especially if you have a little 5-pound dog that shits on the floor as if he weighed 55 pounds.  You gotta love the little guy, but Nigel (the newest addition to the Shovelpants family) is a walking, barking feces factory.  Sure it's tough to hold it in when you're home alone for a good 9 hours or so.  But when I come home after a long day at the office, it never seems to fail.  There are at least 3 specially marked stinky Tootsie-Rolls waiting to be cleaned up.  On top of that, there's a couple strategically-placed puddles of piss to navigate as well.  Ah...the joys of puppyhood.  Where am I going with this?  Well, where we live the garbage men (and yes, I generalize because there aren't any garbage broads doing the job in our neighborhood) come and pick up our trash on Tuesdays.  This, of course, is where all the Nigel Nuggets and Pissy Papertowels go.  We make a point to keep all the garbage in the garage so that our townhouse smells like a spring garden...so all is good.  Unless you forget to take the garbage out.  Friends, I have 2 other adults living in my house with me.  One is the future Mrs. DJ Shovelpants, and the other is her brother.  All of us are capable of wheeling the little push cart out to the curb.  It's not tough.   Last week, however...it seems no one (including myself) could be bothered with it.  So the trash didn't get picked up last week.  That meant all of the little parcels of poop and pottied wipes had a good week to ferment in the humid garage.  Son of a bitch.  We even had a sign posted on the door going outside that read in TF Mrs. DJS's script:  'Hey!  What day of the week is it?  If it is Tuesday, please remember to take the garbage out!  Thank you!'   Can't.  Busy.  Flash forward to this morning, and guess who's standing (in business casual attire) inside the already-full garbage can, struggling to get five more bags to fit inside?  Correctamundo.  Me.  I was stomping that shit down, while my better half held the can so I didn't fall down and dash my stupid head apart.  Every jump launched more stink in her general direction and she looked like she was going to throw up.  Who could blame her?  She was getting blasted by horrible clouds of filth and poop.  Anyway...that's all I got.  Advice for Duf later today.   Shameless Plug:  I don't mean to whore out my little site, but would it kill y'all to toss me a haiku at  urlLink Discount Haiku ?

"            I Liked it Better When He Wasn't Posting at All, A Case Against the Lengthy Blog By Fer, Duf (a.k.a. 'tiny')   Beloved Pandylandaz,  What a weekend.  Mrs. Duf and I went to see the play Chicago.  I liked it well enough but was not knocked out by it.  I like musicals (and I am secure enough in my femininity to say it  and secure enough in my masculinity to admit to a feminine side), but this one seemed overly weighted on songs and not enough on plot advancement and for some reason, it didnt work.  Also, the dancers/chorus were on the stage the whole time (though off to the side and in the dark), and you could see them talking and stretching during other numbers  it seemed like they were not quite in it.  We had a great dinner with my in-laws at Kincaids afterwards  they call their Crme Brulee Burnt Cream.  Also, Mrs. Duf and I had a minor altercation this weekend.  The Mrs is in the running for a new job as the Head Gardener at a local conservatory and seems likely to get it (if she does, I will be so proud of her and so proud to be the husband of the person who holds that job).  On Saturday, she said if I get that job, things are going to have to change around here.  I said whats that supposed to me, and she proceeded to talk to me about housekeeping and (increasing) the extent of my participation therein.    Now, a few thoughts: first, our house is fairly orderly.  Dishes dont linger in the sink.  Nothing is dirty but sometimes things are not orderly.  Laundry can hang out a bit before being put away, and toys dont always leap into the toy box at a steady fast rate, but when they do, they tend to leap back out. (its a toddler thing, youll understand).  My wife has four cats, and they keep our vacuum busy (I wonder sometimes why they aint bald they shed so damn much), and there is always a project or improvement task that could benefit from completion (the computer room is in chaos right now).  But for the most part our place is okay.  Okay, true confession time. We have a housekeeper who comes once a week to see after the bathroom, the vacuuming, the dusting the floors, the windows, etc.  In fact, I look forward to returning home tonight to that spring clean smell.    Now, before I share this next thought, let me say that I do not like comparative living.  It is a dangerous thing to want something that others have.  It is a sickness that is tough to cure.  And besides, no matter how much you have, there is always someone who appears to have more (even Bill Gates wants something that someone else has:  maybe he wants to own a sports team or have a wife who loves him for who he is, maybe he wishes he could sing or that his penis weren't so small).  Having said that, most of our friends who have little ones (not penises, children - although I am secure enough to tell you that I have a very, very small penis - it's like two inches when fully erect and no thicker than a cocktail straw, but I digress...most of our friends with children) dont keep their house as orderly as we keep ours.  So, the implication being the statement things are going to have to change around here bugged me a bit.  I feel like we are doing okay, and that we could be much worse than we are, and Mrs. Duf is saying that (1) we are lousy and live in squalor.  Or, alternatively, she is saying that (2) if I pitched in more, it would be easier to maintain order. Or she is saying (3) she would be happier if married to a man of even average penis size, but lets focus on my first theory:  Pandylandaz (there can only be five (although if Stoner came back, we would have six) dont hate).  Can you help me articulate standards for cleanliness?  Thanks in advance,  MicroDuf  P.S.  Panda.  I wont hate, Ill congratulate, and if I was in Chi-town, I would facilitate.  Play on playa!          "
"            May the Best Man Win   I'm sure some of you are wondering how the Lee Jeans extravaganza went this weekend.  It was great; in fact, we've already made plans to see each other again in August.  After having a beer per inning at Wrigley Field, seeing the fireworks at Navy Pier, enjoying a delicious steak dinner on the Smith & Wollensky patio, having cocktails at Danny's and hanging out at the Lake, it only seemed natural to do it all again sometime.  Here's the kicker...both OG and LJ want to be 'the only one'.  I went out with OG last night after I dropped LJ off at the airport, and he felt the need to profess this.  Now I'm in a pickle...I like both of them, one is local, one is in the city I want to move to...and I'm supposed to decide?  Sorry, boys.  Can't do it.         "
"            Checking In.   Panda, in response to your (possibly rhetorical) question, no, that doesnt happen to me.  Not only do I know everyone in my phone, but I also know their birth date and middle name.  You should call some of those dudes and give them my number.  Then well be even.  Im back from Dallas.  You know the highlight from Dufs post below.  Aside from that fun (by the way, who knew that assassination + conspiracy x homelessness = hilarity?), yesterday morning I caught my flight out of Dallas at the godly hour of 9am (compared to Dufs ungodly 6:30 departure).  Rather than lose sleep by going to the airport with Duf, I rode with another (sorta) coworker.  This was fine (we only got lost 1.5 times), except that this other person did not know the difference between U2 and Duran Duran, a truly horrid offense, and one that I thankfully do not need to get into here (all Pandylandaz know the difference, its a part of the test taken to join our ranks).  Once at the airport and minus the ignorant coworker, I immediately started to calculate ways that I can permanently avoid the Dallas airport in the future.  Its dirty, confusing, crowded, inconvenient, outdated and slow.  Plus, you can only get there on American.  To quote another (sorta) colleague, eewww.  I was starving, so I searched for food.  When I say searched, I mean walked and walked and walked in one direction with my rolly bag and didnt find anything.  Then I gave up and started walking and walking and walking in another direction with my rolly bag until I finally found a yogurt stand, a McDonalds and an Au Bon Pain surrounded by a hungry mob.  I figured my best bet was the Au Bon Pain.  I got in line and surveyed my options  a few crusty day old muffins and bagels, and an odd doughnut-esque item here and there.  I looked up at the menu and found half of it covered in were out of this or we dont sell that anymore fashion.  When I got to the counter, I asked the gentleman working the register, Do you have any flavored cream cheese?  He then looked to his feet and responded I wish! We only have the plain stuff.  I immediately felt sorry for this dude who obviously has an inferiority complex over his stores lack of strawberry cream cheese.  I got a muffin and retreated to my gate.  I hope another trip to Big D is not in my immediate future.          "

Of course, he had some crazy shit that's happened to him recently:  'I've been hospitalized twice in the past couple months.  Once for a huge shoulder injury from a serious car accident and another time for water intoxication.'  Water intoxication??  What the hell is that?    'It's when you actually drink too much water and your body rids itself of all its electrolytes and completely cramps up.'  Only Kevin.

"            This Just in Generalissimo Dufcisco Franco is NOT Dead or 'Miss Hal, can you dig a little deeper?'  By Duf Fer  Long lost (but not forgotten) friends.  I am not dead.  I have been traveling too much, and I have not been down with the blog ups like I should be (gotta get down to get up - BB, can that be a song recommendation for you - put on some James Brown, honey - you can get bogged down in the sad stuff...put on something funky or something angry and draw your poisons to the surface then drink lots of water - all massage therapists advise it.  Which reminds me, spoil yourself too.  Get a facial and a massage and play a round golf at The Wilds in Shakopee).  Anyway, not much is on with me.  Hal and I are in Dallas for a meeting.  Yesterday I was in Tampa...tomorrow I will be in Columbus, Ohio.  It is too much.  I am finally starting to see that...it is too much.  Here is a story.  Last night, Hal and I went to Dealey Plaza to decipher this grassy knoll stuff.  Maybe all that is needed to unravel the Kennedy conspiracy are a fresh set of eyes and some Minnesota pragmatism.  Anyway, it was late-ish, around 9:30, and it was dark.  We were kind of walking around not really getting all the right stuff when this kind fellow (he called himself Miquel Bolton - and I did not get it until I got back to the hotel) came up and explained that we were pointing at the wrong grassy knoll (the place is thick with knolls and they are all grassy).    Well, we are in Texas, and the people are very friendly here (I know this because the 10 people I asked for directions (to the restaurant (Taco Diner in West Village, I recommend it for your next trip the Big D, but warning, no one knows where it is - ask for the West Village mall instead and directions to Dealey Plaza, and directions to our Hilton in Grapevine) were all way nice and...if they didn't know how to direct me, overly disappointed), and Miquel was no exception.  He showed us the window where Oswald ALLEGEDLY fired the shot (Miquel does not buy the lone gunman theory at all nor does he buy the magic bullet theory), he showed us the X that is embedded in Elm street to mark the spot where Kennedy was hit for the first time.  He showed us the manhole cover where the second shot threw his head back, and he showed us where the guy stood who fired shots from behind the what?  That's right,  the  grassy knoll.  He showed us the terrace they have erected in back of the grassy knoll, the memorial, the conspiracy museum.  He explained how the manhole shooter escaped, and how the knoll shooter fled.  He pointed out where Oswald was apprehended, where he was booked in, how he was transferred from one jail to another and the hallway where he was shot by Jack Ruby.  He showed us the austere memorial whose erection (I wrote erection...tee hee) was requested by Jackie O (I used erection and Jackie O in the same sentence...tee hee), and he read the plaque explaining how the citizens of Dallas paid for it (with contributions from others).  He even told us where he was (Waco, Texas) and what he was doing ('getting his play on'  yes, that's a quote - he was 4 at the time) when he heard about the assassination.  His grandfather cried and he recalled that as unusual.  He had never seen that before.  For those of you who have read this post believing that people are genuinely kind and that they offer help and tour guidance from an altruistic spirit of love for fellow man and to add another stone to the solid strong structure we call the community of [wo]man, you are right, just don't read the next paragraph.  Miquel walked us back to our car and explained that he was out of work and needed money to send his daughter to Six Flags tomorrow.  He was working us the whole time.  It gets worse.  Duf, as usual, was cashless.  Hal went into the car and into her purse to cough up a five-spot, and Miquel said (quoting again), 'Miss Hal, can you dig a little deeper?'  BTW, I'm in favor of disclosing all fees up front.  Anyway, as we drove away, Hal, who has always been a bit too PC for my tastes.  Argued that men like Miquel, are a tragedy.  He was bright and personable and knowledgeable about the area.  He was articulate and his sales skills were keen.  He may have had a drinking problem.  I genuinely enjoyed the tour, even as I knew (fairly early on) there was a hook.  But Miquel is not employable, Hal pointed out - a blatant argument for helping the less fortunate - a view I spit on as a hardcore capitalist.  Why should I work to support people who can't just get a stinkin' job?  Explain that Miss PC Hal!           "
"            Maybe it is a Cult   Bassy - like Hal said, K.O.T.  I suggest not listening to Indigo Girls or Tracy Chapman...that shit makes me cry like a baby for no reason.  You know how I told you guys that the holistic yoga thing was helping me cope with the stresses in my life?  Well, I think they are, indeed, part of a cult.  My yoga master has been bugging me to go to this one special healing chakra session with the guru of yoga - Grand Master Li...which happens to cost 200 bones and is on the weekend.  I've been telling him I can't make it, but after getting pressured more last night I told him I don't want to commit to a Saturday (my weekends are very important) or pay the cash.  Then he told me I needed to come for a preparation class on Tuesday night (tonight) and I said I had plans.  The guy wouldn't let me off that easy.  'What are you doing?'  So I finally just told him the truth: 'I have a date.'  'Can you reschedule?'  'Um, no.'  No one is going to tell me to screw up my social life...not even some little, meek, Korean guy.  Sorry, chief.         "

"            The DJS Movie Review Corner   'Allo friends.  I've been on a tear seeing at least one movie a week for the last month or so.  Pretty amazing, eh?  We think so.  Without further delay, let me get right into the shit and give you the low-down on what's what in the cinema.   Finding Nemo  - Saw this a couple weeks ago and was really excited to see it.  However, I was somewhat sick.  I think I was low on iron or something.  As such, I got really tired and and nodded off during parts of the movie.  Days like this made me wish I still drank caffeine, you know?  I could've really used a shot in the arm.  Anyway, the movie was okay.  Not my favorite Pixar effort, but decent.  I still think Monster's Inc. was the best one.  Argue with me if you want.  I win.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Finding Monster's Inc. More Interesting Than Nemo   The Hulk  - I really didn't want to see this until I saw some kind of special on cable about how they did the effects and stuff.  Then, I HAD to see it.  Am I glad I did?  Sure.  Before I hit the theatre, Dirty and I ate a burrito.  It was delicious.  Packed with tender morsels of chicken and the hot sauce was on par.  I washed it down with some refreshing water and I considered myself full.  Off to the show.  The movie was actually suprisingly good.  I expected shit, but it turned out to be a pretty smart flick.  I don't know that kids will like it much as there's a lot of set-up and the green son of a bitch doesn't show up until almost an hour into the flick.  The ending was a little weird for me.  I mean, what the hell is with Nicky Nolte anyway?  The Hulk's dad turned into some big ghost thing and I just didn't get it.  Worth seeing, though.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Rar! Kids No Like Hulk!!!   Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  - Another movie I didn't want to see, but ended up checking it out anyway.  I'd heard that the ending was totally unconventional and that it was crazy with action.  Sounded right up my alley, so I decided that after I put in a shift at my part-time bookstore gig, I'd see the midnight show.  I didn't have anyone to see it with, so I decided to be a complete loser and go by myself.  No really, it's okay.  I only cried a little on the way there.  At the theatre, there were so many Asian kids there, I thought I'd mistakenly walked into 2 Fast 2 Furious.  You know...because they like to trick out their Hondas and such.  Anyway, the movie was mediocre at best.  Yeah there was lots of action, but I didn't care for the character development...was there any?  The chick Terminator, the TX was lame.  She didn't seem like much of a threat.  I did learn one thing though: Claire Danes is not an attractive girl.  She looked like ass.  I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not raving or running out to see T3 again.  Oh...and the title mentioned 'Rise of the Machines.'  I saw plenty of machines.  None of them rose.  Hope that didn't ruin anything for you.   Rating:  6/10   Should've Been Called:  T3: Where's James Cameron?   Bruce Almighty  - I know this one is a little older, but I finally got around to seeing it.  The verdict?  It was a piece of shit.  Good idea gone terribly wrong.  Jimmy Carrey is funny in moments and other times I was like: Dude...you're trying too hard.  I don't know.  Then, they had to ruin an already crappy not-funny movie by slapping you on the ass with a moral.  Save it, friend.  I didn't buy a ticket to have someone teach me what's right.  Fuck you.

All of a sudden Guy #1 has his hands all over me - maybe his arm is around me, or he grabs my hand, or starts stroking my hair.  Like this is some sort of 'sign' for Guy #2 to back off?

"            Let the Juggling Begin   I may have mentioned someone in an earlier post  - Orbitz Guy.  OG called me yesterday and after talking on the phone for almost 45 minutes and asking me out for Tuesday night, I suggested we just meet for a drink in an hour. (I hate to talk on the phone when you can just get together in person.) And why do I always think it's only going to be  one  drink?  Big Surprise: It ended up being several.  But we ended up having a good time.  He was pretty cool and downright hilarious.  I excused myself at one of the bars we were at (yes, there were several of those too) to go to the ladies'.  While I was in the john, I checked my messages...one came through from Lee Jeans.  'Call me tonight...'  So I called him quick to touch base ('I'll call you tomorrow to chat...I'm out with my friends.') and went back to OG.  'Gee you took a long time in there...what's up?'  'I had to call one of my friends.'  Then later last evening he told me how he really 'felt a connection with me' and he could tell I was feeling it too.  (So now he's psychic?)   I'm way too old for this Three's-Company-type-hijinks.  It's already stressing me out.  Let's just hope I don't run into OG when I'm at the Cubs game with Lee Jeans this Saturday.  Then I'd really have some 'splainin' to do.         "
"            Because It Feels Like Friday 5    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  I'm trying to hit every outdoor-seating bar I can this summer.  I'm also attempting to find a new job (not quite as fun or exciting).  [Closed Circuit to the Pandyland crew: I'm looking for a job in Mpls again...cross your fingers.] I will also be moving into a new place in August (if I don't move to Mpls first!).      2. What was your first summer job?  I had a paper route...this lasted about 4 months because I somehow suckered my parents into helping me with it, which completely pissed them off.  If I had to think of my favorite summer job, it was working at the local movie theater. (Popcorn Girl.) I got to see any movie in the city for free, so one summer I saw EVERY SINGLE MOVIE that came out - good or bad.  This also made me very comfortable with going to movies by myself.     3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  Like I've said many times before, Iceland.  Or Australia (since it's winter there right now, the weather is mild).  But I can definitely feel another Mpls trip coming....destination: Country Bar.   4. What was your worst vacation ever?  When I was little, my entire family (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) and I would go to Florida for Easter Break.  One year I got so sunburnt I blistered all over...it was pretty gross.  The worst and most painful vacation ever.  Now that I'm older, I can't remember any bad vacations.  I guess I've had good luck (plus, I plan things meticulously so nothing can go wrong...Billygoat on the other hand...don't get me started.)   5. What was your best vacation ever?  I don't know if this was the absolute best, but I had an awesome time when I was with my parents, bro, and sis-in-law in London and Brussels last Thanksgiving.  We got drunk together, laughed a ton, and saw everything we could in 2 fantastic cities.  Plus, I didn't have to pay.  I think the best vacations are free.          "

"            I Love Me Some Liz   Okay, I have to admit by about 3:30pm yesterday afternoon, I thought about blowing off the Liz Phair concert.  It was one of those days here at work, a handful of people bailed on going to the concert (ahem) and I just wasn't in the mood, ya know?  Christ, I'm glad I went.  We met up at The Refuge in Minnecrapolis (HAL, Dr. Rob Phd, and BS Reid) and strolled in about 20 minutes before she hit the stage.  Opening act?  No time.  She started promptly at 8:15pm and rocked the proverbial pants off of everyone there.  Contrary to popular belief, she only did like 3-4 songs from her much loathed new album.  The rest?  Sprinklings of 'Exile In Guyville' an occasional track off of 'Whip Smart' and a few from 'whitechocolatespaceegg' including one of my all-time favorite Liz songs 'Perfect World.'   I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious...   I don't know.  Say what you will about the 'new' Liz and her 'sell-out' album, but she's still got it in my opinion.  She may be trying to move in a new direction, but she definitely hasn't forgotten what's gotten her this far.  Oh...did I mention that she's friggin' hot?  Wow.         "
"            Love Letters   I thought the art of writing a good love letter had fallen to the wayside long ago, until I received the sweetest letter ever from Lee Jeans yesterday.

You should see him in his cowboy hat and shit-kickers.  Oo-la-la.)  'Warning Sign' by Coldplay just came up on my CD player.  It couldn't be more timely.  So, to all you fellas out there: write your woman a thoughtful letter already.  Sometimes small gestures like that have big paybacks, if you know what I'm sayin'.         "
"            Hot in the City  By Duf Fer  We have had a pretty rough run in 'The Paul' lately.  The week before vacation, a suspected car thief was arrested in our back yard and trashed Mrs. Duf's garden while cursing and waking up TinyDuf at 3 a.m.  Five officers were involved in the hunt, and none of them can distinguish echinacea from weeds.    The next day, the suspected car thief's girlfriend came to our house (our address is a matter of public record) looking for 'keys' that her boyfriend 'dropped' in our yard while hiding out from the police officers (before being found by a bad ass police dog).  The police came by soon after her and said that his keys were included among the items they checked into holding when he was taken to jail.  Their theory:  he dropped drugs in our yard.  I was out of town during the whole affair.  While we were on vacation, our credit card company called and told us that they suspected fraud on our account. Some sucka was charging up a storm (including an $1100 Texaco charge) on our card.  Last night, someone broke into our garage.  All three of our bikes were stolen (including the one I bought Mrs. Duf for Mother's Day this year - it's been ridden twice), our garage people door was damaged severely, and my wife's car stereo was stolen (DJS, I like the way you gave the gift to DJ LZ, and perhaps I will do that too someday to replace her stolen stereo (JK)).    While on vacation, we cleaned out our garage, and among the items we threw away...her old car stereo!  My response to all of this misadventure is almost as upsetting to me as the events themselves. I:  1.  Want to move to a better neighborhood; 2.  Have been spinning theories about who stole our credit card and who broke into our garage, and it is someone I know; 3.  Have been feeling guilty about traveling so much because I have these testosterone driven (and illogical) notions that if I were home, Mrs. Duf would be safer.   4.  Have been thinking about getting a home security system; and  5.  Have been re-examining the propriety of traveling so much and questioning the balance between providing for my family in a job I love (making a good living) and being home more often (even if it means that I earn less money).  This balancing act is a near constant struggle for me.    But mostly I have been thinking about being a better provider and buying a house in a better place so that when I am gone, everyone will be safer.  Our current plan for moving is a 3 year plan.  This will allow us to make home improvements, and it will allow us to be better positioned to buy a house that we can live in for a lenthy (nod to DJS) amount of time (we will save, increase income and decrease expenses (bye bye daycare ($1000 per month), hello public schools ($0 per month)).  But with all these happenings, I wonder if we should not scramble and stretch and just get the hell out of our part of the city now.  No answer seems correct.          "
"           Thanks for that, DJS.  'preciate it.         "
"            I'm With DJS   I've had a bit of the blogging blues lately, too.  It's not like nothing interesting has been going on, I just have been feeling a little under the weather emotionally.  That's kind of weird for me because I'm usually cheery, cheery, cheery, but after rejection 378 on the job front, one can get a little down in the dumps.  So what's the best remedy for that?  Sitting in a dark theater, with smuggled-in Whoppers (delicious), watching the latest indie flick.  That and catching some interesting films on free cable.  Let me recap:   urlLink Dirty Pretty Things : A very touching and intense movie that does not have a dull moment. It's encouraging to see a movie that ends with people of values prevailing.  This movie brought to light the extent people will go to for freedom and a better life - and how you and I take all these things for granted.  Plus, how can you NOT love Audrey Tatou (of Amelie fame)?   urlLink Step into Liquid : As the tagline says - 'No special effects. No stuntmen. No stereotypes. No other feeling comes close.'  I've never surfed in my life, but after seeing this movie, I definitely want to try it at least once.  And who woulda thunk there actually was surfing off the coast of Lake Michigan in little ol' Sheboygan, WI?   urlLink The Swimming Pool : I saw this movie last night and didn't figure out what really happened until about 5 minutes ago.  Now I want to go out and see it again to catch all the nuances.  Very good, but seems pretentious at first (maybe because it's filmed in France?).   urlLink The Karate Kid : I caught this on ESPN Classic, of all stations.  I swear I hadn't seen this since 1984, so it was a true blast from the past.  (Side note: The first time I saw it I was amongst an all-African American audience in a movie theater in Madison, WI - which was great because everyone was yelling at the screen during the karate tournament scene.)  Little Ralphy Macchio seemed so hunky back then; now he just looks like a total dweeb in a red, plastic jacket.  And seeing him with Elizabeth Shue?  She seemed about 10 times bigger than him - what a weird looking couple.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much, even though I was mocking it the whole time.  The ending anthem during the final fight destroyed me: 'You're the BEST, around...nothing is going to ever keep you down!'  Wax on, wax off.   urlLink Van Wilder : I was pretty sceptical about this one when it came on Showtime, but it's a bit of a gem.  Ryan Renold's (Van) comic delivery reminds me of Will Ferrell at his best.  I would call this film a very carass  Animal House  (if that's possible?).  Both the eclair scene and Tara Reid's performance made me gag, but as a whole it was entertaining.  If you want dumb humor, this will deliver.         "

"            Yep.  I Suck.   Hiya P'landers.  My name is DJ Shovelpants.  I used to post on this-here site quite a bit.  Remember me?  Of course, I've had plenty to blog about as of late, but I've got the blogger blahs these days.  Why?  Don't know.  Maybe it's just a simple case of can't...busy...  Though I don't think this post will be lenthy (I intentionally left the 'g' out in the word lengthy.  Please pronounce accordingly) I'll try to keep y'all up to date with what's new.  - Today is DJ LZ's birthday.  She's a whopping 27 years old today, almost four years my junior.  Yeah!  For her birthday, I snuck her bare-bones Saturn SL (with no power windows, locks, steering, etc) in to have a CD player installed.  I had to be all covert about it because we work together and we usually drive in together and it's always in the truck.  I played sick this morning, she drove the truck in and I came in an hour later with the Saturn.  I dropped off the car and made a ransom note that said 'LOOK IN YOUR CAR' and cut it into pieces, dropped it in a box and wrapped it all nice.  I set wrapped box on her seat whilst she was at a lunch meeting.  Hopefully she'll like it.  - Today also marks the day that my little dog Nigel will lose his manhood.  That's right, friends...I'm talking about his ball bag.  It's going bye-bye.  The vet called and said that the operation was successful and that the little guy is just fine.  We get to pick him up tomorrow.  Poor little son of a bitch.  - The Bjork concert - In a handful of words: It was a goddamn religious experience.  I'm not even kidding.  Not only was the whole trip itself enjoyable as all get-out, it was capped off with the absolute best concert I will ever see in my life.  Hands down.  Red Rocks is the coolest venue of all time and the whole event totally made my whole year.  Nothing will come close to this in my book.  I bought a poster from the show and I'm going to do it up with my ticket, some pictures and I'll have a commemorative wall-hanging for the rest of eternity.  It was well worth the drive through So-Dak, Neb, and Wyo.  Good times, good times.  - 2 teachers (one in Stillwater & another in Austin Texas) are going to read my kids book to their 3rd grade class.  I'll get e-mailed reactions and comments from little kids in a couple of months.  I'm also just about finished with my 2nd book, so those who've read the 1st installment and is jonesin' for more will be able to check it out.  (shameless plug)  That's all that's going on with me these days.  Sorry I've been a slacker.  Like I said...it's been the blahs for me, blogger-wise.  Ciao for now, crazies.  - DJS         "
"            Must be the stress   I have a lot going on this week.  First off, today is my last day at work until the Tuesday following Labor Day.  That great, but there are loose ends to tie before I leave today.  And once I do leave today, I have to rush downtown to cook for 150 homeless men.  I'll get home about 9:30 tonight, and then tomorrow morning I close on my condo (a big woo-hoo!), before which I need to get a cashier's check, if they ever get my final figures figured out.  Then I move, move, move, until I'm back at work next week.  So it's a little chaotic for me, though I realize that it's good chaos.  Anyway... I'm not a great multi-tasker.  This may surprise those who've seen me read a book while my stereo is on, with my T.V. muted.  But I just can't keep too many balls in the air - another reason why I've never tried juggling.  Anyway, I thought I was doing alright until I stopped in the ladies room this afternoon.  I looked at my face in the mirror and realized that I looked pretty washed out.  Then it dawned on me - I totally forgot to put on a trace of makeup this morning.  Somehow I woke up, showered, dressed, dried my hair, and did everything else normally, including putting on earrings, but I skipped the makeup step.  I've never left my home without makeup before in my life, unless it was on purpose, or I was under 15.  Weird.         "

Just like I mentioned in my haiku some months back, I'm going to be a fucking hero.  The problem is, I'm going through the 'tests' right now and let me tell you friends, I'm not liking it.

Not just the usual 'turn your head and cough' that male physicals are used to be.  I found out that I weigh 10 pounds more than I thought, my blood pressure is high (a connection?), and that sitting in a gown in the check-up room for 45 minutes can be a very humbling experience.  I also managed to offend the nurse.  She asked if I would mind if she drew blood from a certain vein.  I said 'Hey, you're the doctor or...assistant' as my voice trailed off.  She said, 'Actually, I'm a nurse.'  Yeah?  Well, you've got stanky breath and you could use a shave, nursey.  Yee-ha!   Test # 3 - Head Test  This doesn't happen until I get back from Colorado.  Wait...let me rephrase that.  The day I've set aside for recovering from the roadtrip, I'll be spending 5 (count 'em) FIVE hours taking a psychological profile.  Then, I'll have some head doctor talk to me for an hour at the end.  Jesus Christ!  This is what I'm doing with my day off???  Anyway, not to pat myself on the back, but out of 50+ people that applied for the gig, I'm one of 9 that made it.  That's kind of cool, methinks.

"            Another Week Begins   What's up, sluts?  I went to the Tori Amos/Ben Folds show last night.  I was pretty pumped about it and was anxious to get there on time since Ben was the opener.  My friends who were with me don't get as riled up about music (strike that, I mean spaz out) like I do, so they were taking their sweet time at the bar we went to beforehand.  Needless to say, we got there 5 minutes after his set started.  It was dark, so we couldn't really see which box seats we had, so we just sat down in the first ones we saw.  Ben was awesome - he rocked the house with 'Rockin' the Suburbs' and even got the entire Auditorium Theater to sing 3-part harmony.  Right after Tori came on we got flashlights in the eyes and were told we were in the wrong seats.  Our real seats?  Still box, but several rows back...behind some ass clowns who stood up during the entire show.  Now, as a preface to my upcoming rant, I'm all about having a good time at a rock show.  Hey, stand up, scream, sing along, jump up and down, I could care less...but at  Tori Amos ??  Sit down and shut up.  This one jag-off was dancing with his arms flailing all around. (How he was doing this to 'Pass the Mission', I could not tell you.)  At one point, he was freaking out so much that his chair toppled over and caused a huge disturbance.  Not only was he in my way, but it was also hard to listen to the music since he was such a distraction.  He also started talking (in full voice) to the friends he was with which made a girl in front of us totally lose it - she finally turned around and yelled at him to 'Shut the fuck up!  Everyone here is so annoyed with you!'  (I kid you not.)  On the other side of us was a girl who sang every lyric to every song.  Um, honey, after singing (as loud as you can) with Tori during 'Crucify' we  get  that you're the biggest fan ever.  I didn't pay 60 bones to hear Tori sing a duet with you.  Thanks.  The only respite from this was when Tori covered Don McLean's 'Vincent'.  Absolutely gorgeous.  (As BB can attest to, this song is a guilty pleasure of mine.  Cheesy, I know, but I love it.  And her version was spectacular.)  Thank God the 'lyric girl' didn't know this one.  It was the one time I could actually hear Tori sing.  In other news: Lee Jeans is coming back to Chicago this weekend for Round Two.  My bro and sis-in-law are coming on Saturday too, and they insisted on staying at a hotel that night even though I have plenty of room in my new place.  According to my bro, him and his wife 'don't want to intrude on a girl in heat.'  Dude, gross, you're my brother.  He'll be staying at a hotel called the Willows (Duf may remember staying there once).  This got him pretty excited since he said he could exclaim at bartime (he told me this over e-mail): 'listen up ladies!!.....this party will continue to be off the hook at the Willowz!!!....there will be crystal in the fridge and suds in the tubs....only at the Willowz!!!'    I guess you have to know him and his off-the-wall sense of humor to get that.  Sometimes I worry about my brother's sanity.  He always makes for a good story, though.  Let's hope he doesn't break out the Elvis glasses again.  My sis-in-law then sent me a few links soon after...First watch  urlLink this , then go  urlLink here  .

"            I've Surpressed Political Blogs for a Long Time, but I Can't Remain Silent on This One  By Duf Fer  California.  What the hell are you doing out there?  Last November, Gray Davis is re-elected.  In January, he begins his second term.  In April (or so) multi-millionaire Congressman Darrrell Issa begins a drive to recall him.  In July, it succeeds.  In October, Davis will face a recall election.  In other words, for no malfeasance whatsoever, a sitting Governor may be ousted less than one year after he was re-elected.  The cost to California taxpayers?  $70,000,000.  Nice (if only it could happen in MN)!  Why recall Davis?  Well, he supposedly misled voters about the size of the budget deficit.  Yep.  That has never happened before, and not only should Davis be recalled, but he should get the same punishment as all those Enron felons (what?  They havent been punished yet?  Oh.).  At last count, there are almost 200 candidates on the ballot.  The early favorite:  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Now, I have to give Arnold props.  He has been politically active, and is not running without any experience at all.  He is a Republican, but he is married to a Democrat, so that makes him relatively trustworthy.  I think he would make a fine governor; I don't want to use this blog to put down Arnold.    But I do want to say that what ails California is not going to be solved by selecting a new Governor.  California is either the most populous state or very nearly the most populous state.  They had a thriving (even if overvalued) dot.com based economy that came crashing back to earth along with the Nasdaq.  Silicon Valley is a shadow of its former self as the tech boom has settled a bit and other parts of the country have become technology headquarters too (see, e.g. Boston, Austin and Fargo).    Homeland security obligations and a weak national economy, factors that have sent almost every state into budgetary chaos, are particularly acute in California because it is so big (both in terms of geographical reach and in terms of population).  California has a number of potential terrorism targets to defend (including a large number of hospitals that require overhauling to meet potential chemical and biological threats).    California was creamed by energy deregulation and by crooked energy execs and perhaps it can be said that Davis could have handled all that better.  However, given a chance to oust him in November, voters declined to do so.  Add to all that the fact that diminished Federal support to states (which allows us to fund the war against Iraq to the tune of $4,000,000,000 per month) particularly harms California.  Also, in California, as in most states, the Governor is only as good as the legislation that reaches his desk.  One could argue that Gray Davis should have been a more effective leader in the legislature, but let me make this one bet:  whoever takes over will not resolve the budget crisis in California.  The crisis is bigger than one person and requires resolution of issues outside of California.  In my view, states run just like households:  in order to decrease debt, you need to do one of three things:  1.  decrease spending, 2.  increase income, or  3.  both  Oh, one other thing, the second option has to be done without increasing taxes.  So, short of more financial support from the federal government, the only realistic options are all political suicide (what politician in his right mind is going to increase taxes today?  A politician can only cut spending so far, before he gets blamed for every problem from bad roads to poor schools to increased crime.  A governor needs a legislature to do anything anyway).    The only justice to come out of the whole scenario is that Darrell Issa, the gentleman who funded the whole thing so that he could take over when Davis was recalled, had to end his candidacy when Arnold threw his hat into the (overcrowded) ring.  [BTW:  Issa made his fortune selling car alarms, so if you need another reason to question his judgment, there it is.]  Issa spent a couple million financing a fiasco for his own personal gain, only to leave chaos behind and force himself to make a tearful speech about how he wasn't going to be able to reap the benefits of his self-motivated effort to place his will over the will of the voters.     The only question that remains to be answered is:  who will reap the benefits?  Not California, and not any state that follows its lead by allowing partisan politics to usurp the democrat process.  Californians, you elected a Governor less than a year ago.  You have a legislature.  You have a voice.  Use them.  Dont recall Governor Davis.             "

"           Duf, we seem to be on the same wavelength this week (or maybe just notice the same pop culture phenomenons).  I watched 2 episodes of that show last night and was completely delighted (I am delighted for 2 reasons: 1) because I even  could  watch it - I've never had cable, and in my new place I tapped into the line and am getting it free - shhhh! don't tell Comcast.  2) Watching these gay men make the straight guys really uncomfortable makes for some good comedy.)   Not only do they help these guys with a make-over, but it seems they help them plan something nice for their significant other.  For one, it was a marriage proposal.  For another, it was learning to sing a song he wrote for his wife.    I hope more straight men catch on and watch this show.  So many guys out there need this kind of help, and I'm convinced these kind of positive changes will lead to world peace.  Duf, you are definitely not alone.         "
"            Anita Gaye  By Duf Fer  Apparently there is a new show on television's Bravo network where five gay gentlemens will do a life makeover for a straight gentleman.  It's called 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.'  I think I need to be on this show.    First of all, I have been wearing essentially the same kinds of clothes since 1980 when I started to pick my own outfits. It is almost impossible to see me in something other than a polo style shirt and Docker's style pants (standard brown shoes by Vegetarian Shoes of London, thanks).  I bought new glasses and was horrified by what I perceived as a radical eyewear departure, but only one person at work has noticed (props to HAL).  In other words, my radical departure was not a departure at all.  Second, my eye for interior decorating is not only color blind, it is blind, blind.  So I could benefit from some fabulous direction as well.    Third, when I go to a restaurant, I usually eat the same thing.  In part this is because most places have 3 or 4 vegetarian choices, but it is also linked to my (mild) epicurean conservatism.  I know enough not to embarass myself at a business dinner, but I could also use some culinary refinements (ex:  we were at Savories in Stillwater last weekend, and when they brought out the figs with candied almonds and creamed gorgonzola as a pre-meal palate exciter, not only did I think it was tiny limes with whipped cream, but I didn't know if I should eat the entire fig or what...HELP!)  Last, the only time I have ever changed my hairstyle was in college.  I had a high top fade for a semester or two (and compared to Kid-n-Play it was more of a mid top fade), but other than that, I have sported to same doo since conception.    I went to the  urlLink show's web site , but to sign up for a makeover, you have to live in the New York area.  Drats!           "

She's the kind of person who gets caught up in details that she can't see anything else. She also insists on asking you about every said detail because she a) wants to seem like she includes everyone and b) isn't confident enough to make a decision. I can appreciate being included in the decision-making process if that does factor at all in her intentions, but C'MON...I can't tell you how it annoys the shit out of me to be bombarded with 8 questions about something that hasn't even been discussed in any detail with the client and she's asking these questions because she's not confident in being able to meet the client's expectations and she thinks they will leave us. She has no foresight to capture the essence of what the client wants if she can't include every component the client mentions in a brain-storm session. She does this with EVERY client and no client has left our company for this reason. She has no big picture skills or perception that this is a FUCKING WEB SITE. We are not saving lives, helping the poor, feeding the homeless, or even adding to the intelligence of the population. We're shlocking products to consumers. That's it. It's absolutely maddening and given my mentioned foul-ass mood, I've actually thought about picking up my computer and tossing it at her.   I've got a hankerin to get drunk right now.

"            Ive been to heaven, hell, and back again   Greetings, Pandyland.  I know, its been awhile.  I missed you too.  Dufs right.  Im a changed woman.  While walking through the U2 exhibit I thought to myself (swear to God), this is what heaven must be like.  The only difference is in the real heaven, security guards probably dont ask me to remove my tongue from the display case.  The only real downside was the other people at the exhibit.  There is an area dedicated to U2 fans (zines, etc.) and you can sign a guest book, if you so desire (Desire, get it??  Like the song?).  A woman (inexplicably, in her twenties) yelled, Mom, you have to read what people wrote!  This stuff is hilarious!!  Bono [she pronounced like Chers husbands name], I love you, will you marry me?  Thats nuts!.  Shut up lady, it came from my heart!  If the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday was heaven, OHare airport on Sunday was hell (I had to fly though there from Cleveland).  Apparently, when scattered showers hit Chicago, all remaining humanity and kindness goes out the window, and chaos reigns.  After being put on two flights that were subsequently cancelled, I was given a standby ticket for the last flight to Minneapolis that night.  As a consolation, or additional kick in the ass, depending on you outlook, I was guaranteed a seat on a flight leaving Monday afternoon and given a discount coupon for a hotel.  When I asked where I could get my bag for my impending unplanned for overnight in Chicago, the gate agent finally looked up at me, laughed, and muttered good luck.  I mercifully landed a seat on that last flight, (leaving at 11pm) and got the hell out of hell.  The cherry on top was the earache the flight gave me to remember it by.  But as I finally got to my bed at 2am, I could not have cared less  I was home!!  Anyway... I'm never leaving Minnepolis again.  It was a nice run.          "

"            Flavored Pop and Friday 5   Duf, it's funny you mentioned that brand of soda pop.  I moved last Thursday, and hired 3 large AfAms to help me out.  Because it was a hot day, I asked them what I could get them to drink.  I offered them my good imported beer, but they insisted on something else: Tropical Sprite Remix.  They love(d) the stuff.  To them, it was delicious.  Duf, you must have more sophisticated tastes.  All and all the move went well (other than the fact that they sent the elevator down with ALL OF MY SHIT - no one went down with it, some a-hole on the 4th floor called the elevator, and my stuff all fell out - but only a few things broke).  I can't wait to be in Minneapolis, but I'm not looking forward to moving again.  Oy.  Now, on to the business...   1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   I try to aim for 7am, but usually don't get my ass out of bed until 7:30-7:45.  It's pretty nice working for a NYC-based company, cuz the hours are 9-5.  I usually roll in about 9:15am.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?   It's hard for me to sleep past 8am, unless I was drinking heavily the night before.  Visiting Lee Jeans makes sleeping in virtually impossible.  He gets up at 5:30am during the week and is a real go-getter on weekends too - he insists on getting up, getting coffee, and reading the paper by 7am.  What the hell?  Needless to say, I can barely keep my eyes open right now.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   Turn on music that makes me smile, turn on my computer to check my e-mail, and/or listen to NPR for the weather and quick news report.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?  On the weekends I can get out in 10 minutes if I don't shower.  During the week, I can take up to an hour if I take my sweet time.     5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?  The Bagel on Broadway - it's just down the street from me and is the best Jewish deli in town.  No matter what time of the day, they put pickles and challah bread on your table.  Nothing like pickles and coffee to cure a hangover on a Saturday morning.          "
"            What's the Story Morning DJS?    1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   Usually around 6:30am.  It all depends if DJ LZ (who gets up earlier than me) brings Nigel upstairs and tosses him on the bed.  If he scampers around and pounces on my face (which he did this morning, the son of a bitch) its quite a bit earlier.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?   I don't tend to sleep in on the weekends.  I'm one of those people that think no one needs more than 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night.  I stay up late and get up early.  But, if I were to sleep in late, it's generally not any later than 8:00am or so.  I'm going to sound like a macho Navy-SEAL dick here, but: You can sleep when you're dead.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   Groan, piss, moan.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?   Usually, if I need to do the full-meal deal (shit, shower, shave) it'll take me a little longer.  On a typical day, I'm out the door in about 20 minutes or so.  That is, of course, if I don't dilly-dally.  Me?  No...    5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?   I'd say Jamba Juice if there was one on the way to work.  Typically, I don't stop for breakfast.  I know it's the most important meal of the day (blah, blah, blah) but I usually don't have the time.  I am a big fan of McDonald's breakfast, though.  Dee-licious.         "
"            Not Such a Bad Friday Five  By Duf Fer   1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?  It really varies.  I have an alarm clock (her name is TinyE) and she goes off at inconsistent times.  Usually it is between 6:00 and 7:00.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?  No, my alarm clock does not recognize weekends.  I used to sleep in until like 8.  Sometimes I get up super early (5:30) and play golf.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?  Void.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?  It varies, sometimes I surf the web and that extends my prep time.  It usually takes me about 30 minutes.  It takes me another 30 minutes to get TinyE ready.   5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?   It's a three way tie:  McDonald's (multiple locations), The Highland Grill (St. Paul) and The Louisiana Cafe (St. Paul).         "
"            I Don't Like the Sprite in Me   The other day, I had a bottle of Tropical Sprite Remix (no, I'm not making that name up).  You'd think I would like it.  As an American Negro, I really connect to Sprite products generally (all their ads are targeted right toward urban blacks (of which I am both)).  And, for those of you who don't know it, my people luvs them some flavored pop.  If you've ever wondered who buys strawberry or orange or grape pop, its AfAms, baby, its AfAms!  But I digress...  Tropical Sprite Remix is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth, and I am a cigar smoker, so that's saying something.         "

Word to the wise: don't let your parents unpack your stuff.

I couldn't eat cereal for a couple days because I couldn't find my bowls.  2) I let Mom unpack my books, and she found  urlLink this .  Since my mom would  never  believe that her little angel would buy such a thing on her own, I just blamed it on my crazy Minnesota friends, telling her it was bought for me as a 'gag gift'.

There is an old guy making out with a girl in that car' and pointed out the car behind us.  I looked over and caught a haggard-looking man who seemed to be around 70, smooching on a woman who was probably in her mid-twenties.  I'm glad I wasn't eating at the time.  I can only surmise that she was a prostitute, but the vehichle, woman, and location did not provide the context in which I would expect to stumble across someone turning a trick.  That said, I don't think those two were exactly dating.  As my companion pointed out 'oooohh, I think she's really drunk'.  Ewwww!  And you think Bob is a slut?         "

"           Panda - I know nothing about Bob, other than his dumb name and haircut, but considering he's on a show as daft as The Bachelor only stirs the embers of my dislike for the clown.    Don't get me wrong, I'm all about imperfections.  Some of the celebrities I've got crushes on are sometimes a bit out there.

"            The Man of my Dreams  by Panda 'Ive Dated All Types' Bear  Now, I'm not saying I know much about Bob Guiney.  I admit I probably have gotten sucked into the media hype surrounding him, but there's a reason so many girls think Bob's the ideal man (or at least  seems  to be).  He's  not  perfect.  Not even close.  He's clumsy, sensitive, and hilarious.  He's divorced.  He has a goofy haircut.  He doesn't have tons of money.  This makes him seem accessible to most girls out there.  When a middle-of-the-road woman looks at a man like Bob, she probably thinks 'Hey, even I'd have a chance with that guy.'    On the other hand, all the other Bachelors in the past were the exact opposite.  They were rich, arrogant, too-good-looking clowns that were just looking for a hot piece of ass.  Why would the majority of the women out there be attracted to that?  Just cuz they have better haircuts?  In my opinion, it's someone's imperfections that make him or her lovable.            "

"            Everyone Wants to Be Found   BB, I happened to catch that one a couple weeks ago.  Bill Murray may get an Academy Award for this film since he didn't get one for  Rushmore ...but his humor came through differently here than in his other movies.  He perfected his sarcastic-lounge-singer-shtick on SNL, however during the most memorable scene of  Lost in Translation , he sings a karaoke version of 'More Than This' with absolutely no condescencion.  The electric chemistry between Scarlett Johansson's character and Murray's is also cemented during this scene.  No doubt, anyone who sees this film will get lost in it.  On a very different side of things, I saw  urlLink The Magdalene Sisters  last weekend.  This movie is a fierce expose of Ireland's Magdalene laundries (which detained more than 30,000 morally 'wayward' women to labor indefinitely in convent purgatories, until the last was shut down in 1996).  There were some horrific scenes in this movie that were just inexcuseable, driving home the director's obvious anger over this shameful blight in the Church's history.  My feeling upon leaving the theater: sadness and a contempt towards the religious figures of my own faith that could have allowed this to happen.  But this sort of thing has happened throughout history - women being proscecuted for being 'temptresses' to men.  Maybe it's not the religion that's to blame; perhaps we should blame the men (and women) who went along with it without questioning their own moral implications.  One movie you should NOT go see:  urlLink Once Upon a Time in the Midlands .  It's slow and not funny.  Not even worth reviewing.           "
"           HAL & I saw a movie this past Saturday, which we could both highly recommend. Check out  urlLink Lost in Translation  - well worth the money & time.

I expressed happiness but did not over do it.  I thought about yelling at her.

"           This from my Concert Friend Who is One Sharp Cookie By Duf Fer   ...in my opinion, the fact that we sat down for about 1/4 of the REM songs wasn't a reflection of us, but rather the songs. You really can't rock out to Nightswimming or Everybody Hurts. I'd say even 20 year olds would sit down during ballads.  I also think in Minnesota, perhaps more than in other states, there is definitely a herd mentality. People stand up if others stand up and don't if they don't. I'm definitely included in that, myself. I feel a great deal of social pressure not to stand if the people around me, especially behind me, aren't standing. That was true 15 years ago and it was true Tuesday. I remember years ago going to concerts and wondering why no one was dancing. I do think a younger crowd is more likely to stand because young people are more self-absorbed than others. But no one sat during any of the Fleetwood Mac concert and as we've discussed, that was the very definition of yuppy concert. I don't think there was much sitting during the Paul McCartney concert, but I can't say for sure. I do remember there was a jackass talking loudly during a lot of it, which was VERY annoying!   I think she is right.  I feel that song selection was an energy drain, and R.E.M. has its share of ballads that really play well on enduring albums and can be fine in concerts.  They have enough up tempo rocking tunes to keep things high too.  I also feel pressure to sit if the people behind me aren't standing.  I once had my life threatened at an Indigo Girls concert...          "
"            Thats weird.   Today I folded and called the cable company to request hook-up.  Lest you think Im frivolous, I signed up for the most basic service (less than $10/month) so that I can get decent reception (I cant watch The O.C. in black and white with snow, yo).  I have guilt over all the DVDs I havent gotten around to watching, books I havent read, fresh air I havent had, and I think going without Comedy Central will open up about 17 hours in my week.  Anyway, I spoke with Glen (who was very helpful), and curiosity got the best of me.  I had to ask what the various levels of cable-dom would bring me.  Apparently, there are 3 levels of basic cable (wisely called 1, 2 and 3).  Im getting the first option.  Glen explained what channels are available for each option and when he mentioned Fox News (part of option #3, FYI), he editorialized that, if you like news, thats a really good channel.  Uhhh, thanks Glen, but Im doing just fine without Bill OReilly right now.  Point of the story is this I get nervous around people that are enthusiastic about Fox News.  Its one of my more recent phobias.          "
"            Satisfactory in St. Paul  By Duf Play Orange Crush, Damnit Fer  Last night, at the R.E.M. show, I found myself thinking a lot about the event as a description of my demographic.  The American middle class, ages 30 to 40, largely white (your humble author excluded), largely educated, largely interested in staying in touch with the side of self that rocked from time to time.  What became apparent is that time has worn away our ambitions; we have aged with our performers.   Michael Stipe and the gang came out and started off with three energy filled and older R.E.M. standards (I should look them up, but Im at work and need to hurry this along).  Stipe was a whirlwind of energy dancing and throwing his arms, jumping and cavorting.  He talked about his penis.  But as the show continued on, his energy lagged.  The overall energy lagged.  Concert energy is a weird symbiotic thing.  One can get bogged down in wondering whether the band creates the energy and the crowd feeds off of it, or whether the crowd creates the energy and the band feeds off it.  Most would acknowledge that both the band and the crowd have the ability to create and kill a good vibe.  The best shows are those where the two work together to create a phenomenal energy (see, e.g. the Pearl Jam show at the Xcel Energy Center this past June).  Last night, in St. Paul, a great concert was made good by a lack of energy (HAL and Panda will recall our Coldplay show in Chicago where the band showed up to rock, but the fans did not).  As I analyze what depleted the energy last night, what Im left with is the following:  R.E.M. by its set selection, failed to follow a pattern that promotes an energetic response.  For my money, the best concerts follow one of three formulas.    Formula one:  The concert starts kind of low (slower tempo song that scream warm up) and finishes high leaving an emotional peak at the end.  This is one of my favorite models.  The band knows their entrance is good for 15 minutes worth of energy, use that to play slow and low.  Formula two:  or, what I call the inverted bell curve:  bands start high, bring things down a bit and then finish high again.  Not a personal favorite, but I have seen it done very well.  Formula three:  is the (extremely difficult and rarely pulled off formula) of starting high and staying high all night.  Bands that hope to pull this off need to draw on a number of things:  a selection of up tempo rocking songs that they can play for two hours, a crowd that will, with them, keep things at a fever pitch, and an emotional hook (the loss of an important person to the band, or a homecoming, a reunion show, or a retirement show, anger, glee, drugs (not kidding) something, anything).  Last night, R.E.M. followed what I call the EKG model where they vacillated to closely between up tempo songs and down tempos songs.  Any D.J. worth a turntable investment will tell you there is a value in having some connection (in tempo or in theme from one song to the next).  The EKG model is not conducive to good energy. At one point I felt like I was at mass. Sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up.  Second, Stipe talked too much.  I know that concert conversations can build intimacy, and his stories were great, but if cutting the comments in half would have allowed a couple of more songs (like, oh, say Orange Crush), I think we all would have been better off.  Third, they did not play Orange Crush.  Fourth, the show was not sold out  that can keep a band flaccid like nothing else.  In the age of $75 dollar tickets, it is clear that the stakes are higher.  Concertgoers are right if they expected the band to do most of the heavy lifting.  I also suspect that there is actuarial methodology around the benefits of having a nearly sold out show at $75 per seat instead of a sold out show at $50 per seat.  While it is not egalitarian, my thought is that tiered pricing is the way to go  it allows your fans to come without being limited by income restrictions.  Sure, its yucky that those who have more money to spend can get better seats, but at least more people can go.  In any event, the show was not sold out, and I think that contributed as an energy drain.    Fifth, to dovetail on my opening comment, I think our beloved band, and its beloved fans, are part of a demographic that desperately wants to rock and truly wants to go all night long, but just cant do it.  My concert friend (as my brother in law calls her) are thirty somethings, and we danced all night at Pearl Jam, but I think we were inspired by our younger co-goers who have the metabolism to rock non-stop.  Without them last night, we were not ashamed to sit from time to time.  But about my demographic:  we have to recharge our Starbucks card, we have schedule maintenance for our traction control cars, and we have a spreadsheet due right after our 9:00 conference call.  Like many of the folks at the concert last night, we want to think we can stand up for two hours of great rock and roll, but instead, our default setting is to sit for fine entertainment.

Ticket price:  $75 Ticketmaster markup:  $215 Shipping fee:  $10 Handling:  $17.50  Now, for you younger Pandylanders, R.E.M. is an alternative rock and roll group.  Rock and roll is a style of music that Duf listened to when he was your age.  R.E.M. started in the late 70s in a town called Athens in a state called Georgia.  While they have had many hit records, it could never be said that they are as popular as Brittney Spears or Justin Timberlake or anything.  R.E.M. has a site where you can request songs for them to play tonight.    I requested:   Orange Crush  from the controversial album  Green    'Follow me, don't follow me:  I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush.'

"            We All Mourn in Our Own Way   I may not have listened to much Johnny Cash in my day, but I do really like Bob Dylan, and from the little I know about Johnny, I'd say the two are fairly similar.  They both have a huge male following, both write  amazing  lyrics (need I refer to my favorite Bob song, 'To Make You Feel my Love'), both have a dark side, and both have/had so-so voices.  Also, the influence they both have on other musicians says a lot about their great talent.  So I thought I'd mourn in my own way today at noon, by heading over to the  urlLink H & M  grand opening on Michigan Ave.  The Midwest has needed this store for a while now, and it's  finally  here.  You'd think I was in line with 12-year-old girls going to an N'Sync concert the way people were pusing, shoving, and carrying on.  When they finally lifted the rope for me and my friend Kellie, we had to rush in and grab the first things we saw.  There was no trying anything on, so I just nabbed a purse, bought it, and said good-bye to Kellie.  She actually took the whole day off of work just to shop there today.

"            I Hang My Head and Cry  By Duf Fer  I am an alcoholic.  I am a drug addict.  I am a homosexual.  I am a genius. -Truman Capote  Im an artist, a poet, a genius, I know it.  I dont buy cheeba, I grow it.   -Adam Yauch  The man in black is dead.  I learned of it this morning while getting ready for work.  If you dont understand Johnny Cash (my wife does not understand Johnny Cash.  When I play his music, she groans audibly.  I wont put her down for that.  Johnny Cash is not the most easily appreciated musician of all time.  He does not sing exceptionally well (and never really did).  He is not exactly Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix with the guitar (though his gifts are ample).  There is much about his life that is not glamorous or enviable.  But if you dont understand Johnny Cash), if you dont get why he is so admired,  then you owe it to yourself to try to understand him.  He is one of the best songwriters this country has produced.  He recorded music for almost fifty years.  He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  He was a gospel musician.  If you did a graph of the people he inspired and the people they inspired and the people they inspired, you would get all the way from Johnny Cash to Jack Johnson, and you would touch hundreds of artists in between.  Justin Timberlake was apparently raised on Johnny Cash.    The man in black was extraordinarily creative.  Along with his wife, June Carter Cash, he recorded the hit song Ring of Fire which is about a couples love but is derived from a term that every birth mother knows quite well.  By tying the two concepts together, the song asks what you would go through to create something meaningful.  If there is a more succinct statement of the cost of love, I dont know what it is.  Ring of Fire is also an apt description of the creative process or, at least, Johnny Cashs creative process.  As further testament to his creativity, he recorded songs by Sound Garden and by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and made them his own.  I adore Nine Inch Nails, but they will never own Hurt again; when Johnny Cash sings the needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting, somehow it becomes so much more powerful.    Johnny Cash wrote books and studied the bible.  He won a lot of Grammys and admiration in both Nashville and New York City.  Hell, earlier this month he was nominated for 7 MTV video music awards.    Johnny Cashs love for June Carter was so profound and sincere, it compelled him to quit drugs and drinking and turn to Jesus.  He prayed daily and sincerely, but he would also kick your ass if you needed it.    Every man should aspire to be like Johnny Cash; every woman dreams of taking a rebel hell-raiser like him and converting him into a family man.    Though it is wrong of me to write it (I never met the man and cannot claim to know him).  I wonder if asked to describe himself, like Truman Capote did, like Adam Yauch did, I wonder if Johnny Cash might not say that he was:  An Alcoholic A drug addict A felon An asshole An infidel A divorcee A sinner A veteran A musician A songwriter A husband An uxorious husband A father A Christian A poet, and  A genius  So this morning, when I heard the news that Johnny Cash was dead, I thought about a couple of his own words.  His words about love for his wife June:   I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  I keep the ends out for the tie that binds...   Because youre mine, I walk the line.   For his love, he walked the line.  Words are limited.  Actions are too, but much less so than words.  Songs about actions backed up by a life  thats powerful and profound.  Profound like his words about mortality:   I hear the train a comin  Its comin round the bend   Then, of course, theres the gospel standard that the Carter Family made famous, but that Johnny Cash also recorded:   I was standing by my window On one cold and cloudy day   It was so fitting to learn that this great American Icon is gone on a cold and cloudy morning.  R.I.P. Johnny Cash.    [May] the circle be unbroken          "

"            A Little Griping  By Cranky Duf'  Last night, I caught a red eye in San Francisco (11:50) to come back to Minnesota (8:30 after the connection in Chicago) for a meeting with both of my bosses (one of whom was flying in from NY).  I adore my bosses and feel quite fortunate to report to them.    My NY boss, who could rival Panda for frequent flyer miles, is a bit of a fraidy cat when it comes to air travel.  Anyway, he cancelled the trip and did not tell me.    He claims he cancelled because the fare was too high (which is about like DJS cancelling because the Bjork show was too long of a car trip).  But I think it is a 9-11 thing.  That tragedy hit him really hard.    Anyway, had he given me a head's up, I would have taken an alternate flight (there was one at 6:00 a.m. PST today, and another one at 2:30 PST - I could have worked a full day in San Fran and come home at a reasonable hour - alright, I could have done some tourist-y things instead of working and still come home at a reasonable hour).   Instead I am at my desk and so tired that my whole body hurts.           "
"            By Popular Request...(okay, just Bass Babe)   Hiya kids.  Been a long time since I rapped at ya.  What's new?  Well, let's see...  - I finished the 3rd draft of my 2nd book.  It's now available for people to read (no pressure, friends).  I've been working my proverbial ass off for the last year (with a couple months off here and there) to get it done and it finally is!  Now I'll give myself a breather before I start the whole process again.  - Tonight I start my secondary career as an on-call firefighter/EMT.  Well, tonight is my orientation, anyway.  Turns out that there were 50 candidates and I'm one of 7 that made it this far.  Cra-zy.  I expect I'll have some interesting posts in the months to come.  Stay tuned, Pandtastics!  - I'm going to golf for the first time in my life on Saturday.  I imagine it will also be my last itme golfing as well.  I was cornered by some friends here at work and told it'll be fun and that it doesn't matter if I suck, since it's a best-ball challenge.  Snick here at work claims I may just have a wicked 'short game.'  What the hell does that mean?  Also, I don't know if I play right or left handed.  I'm not kidding.  - Item!  Anyone else stoked to see 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico?'  Really?  I'm the only one?  Well, it's got Salma Hayek in it, plus lots of guns.  It...can't...miss....!  - I haven't been able to fight space aliens after the loss of Stoner in outer space combat.  The academy has been calling for months, but I just can't seem to get it together and take to the stars as of late.  Hopefully, this will change and I'll be able to save the universe again.  - We're working on a video here at work.  I wrote the script and cast over 24 people to appear in it, including our very own HAL.  I even have a small cameo.  If we get together for a Pandyland Burrito Jamborree 4, we might have to screen it before the boozin' and singing commences.  Whattaya say?  Okay...that's going to do it for me.  Until next time, keep your pants on and keep reaching for the chips!  Delicious chips, that is.         "
"            C'mon Pandies!   I want to see some posts out of you. We haven't heard from DJS in quite some time...hope he isn't off fighting space aliens. Please come back Captain DJS!         "

We got to the Lambeau parking lot by 8:30  AM .  Mom thought it was way too early for grilling out, so what is the next best alternative for early morning tail-gating?  Quiche of course!  My little brother was not pleased about eating his slice of spinach quiche next to some Viking fans eating double cheeseburgers and fresh corn on the cob boiled in a garbage can (now that was hardcore).

"            Yo, Where You At?   Hey Pandies...it's long lost Bass Babe. Where have you been Bass Babe? one might ask. Well, I've also been suffering from the Blogger Blues and haven't felt like posting while I sort out my Jerry Springer-esque personal life. It's been a tough couple months but I think I've finally reached the clearing. No one has stolen my bike and I have a new gig to look forward to this evening. ;) (Shout out to Duf Fer!) So here's the Friday Five comin at 'ya.    1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   Dishes. I have a dishwasher, but I even hate doing the minimal dishwashing like when I cook something in a big pot. I also dislike unloading the clean dishes into their respective cabinets or drawers. Laundry also ranks up there because it's time consuming.    2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I don't mind vacuuming and cleaning out my closet of all the clothes I don't wear anymore. I just did this recently and it was pretty great to downsize by 7 grocery bags full of clothing!    3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   Just clean as needed.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Nothing odd. Just make sure the kitchen is clean.    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  My bathroom and kitchen before I went out of town last weekend. I, like Panda, enjoy coming home to a clean apt.          "
"           Hal, I'll have you know I cleaned my bathroom floor this morning with Scope.  Oh wait, my bad...actually, that was  Billygoat  before we were engaged, when I told him I wouldn't come over to his place unless his bathroom was cleaned.  Desperate measure for sure, but where was the logic?  That shit was sticky for weeks.           "
"            Very timely.    With the recent move, Ive been cleaning a lot, and having conversations with others about cleaning.  During the course of one conversation, I realized that there is always one weird cleaning thing that someone likes doing (and everyone else hates).  It was decided that several people should get together and go to each others homes and execute the task that we each enjoy doing.  The theory was that everyone would be simultaneously be happy and clean.  Ill report back with the results.   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   Clearing clogged drains  hate it.  I also dislike dusting and vacuuming, but hate is too strong a word.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   Alright  heres my weird cleaning thing  I like cleaning dead bugs from light fixtures.  Sorry, but I cant help it.  I also dont mind doing laundry (including putting clothes away), unless I need clean clothes and I dont have time for laundry.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   No routine.  But I am tidy.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Not really.  Before I go to bed, I like to straighten up (If Ive done the dishes, I make sure they are put away), but I dont know if that falls into odd territory.  It's not like I clean my bathroom floor with mouthwash...    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  Last night I finally put my bed together and spent my first night in the new place (!!!).  I cleaned the bedroom floor, and my parents graciously helped me dispose of the boxes and packing materials that took up my entire main room.  Finally, I'd just like to say that I think the strong arm of the law came down on Phil because he didn't sell patriotic baked goods.  Just my $0.02.          "
"            Best Album I've Gotten In A While   Friends, I can't tell you how much I love the new  Fountains of Wayne  effort  'Welcome Interstate Managers.'   Sure, you've probably heard their radio-friendly hit 'Stacy's Mom' but there's so much more to these guys that I can't even begin to tell you how much I dig this record.  These guys, admittedly, are a band that knows how to have fun.  That's not to say that all of their songs are about clowning around and recording tracks that are barely there in the effort to illicit laughs.  Here are some sample lyrics.  From  'Bright Future In Sales'   -  I gotta get my shit together, 'cause I can't live like this forever.  You know I've come to far and I don't want to fail.  I got a new computer and a bright future in sales...yeah, yeah.   From  'Hey Julie'  (my fav) -  Working all day for a mean little man, with a clip on tie and a rub-on tan.  He's got me running round the office like a dog around a track, but when I get back home you're always there to rub my back...   Okay, I'm not doing any justice to them, but trust me.  It's certified DJS Platinum.  When Dirty and I go on roadtrips, we usually come back with a CD that was the 'Official Soundtrack of the Trip.'  Fountains of Wayne won by a landslide.  We played it non-stop, yo.  Swing by for a listen if you're in the hizzy.         "
"           'When you lose a loved one to death [or to eviction], the event is ingrained in your memory for life. It is Your Story. Telling your story is the first step in healing and coming to terms with your loss.'  Thank you, Duf, for  urlLink telling your story .  I hope it helped.           "
"            La Morte d'Phil  By Duf Fer  Those of us who work in the International Plaza Building (DJS, Hal and me) have suffered a tremendous loss.  Our beloved Phil, owner, manager, cashier, stock boy and conversationalist of Phil's Snack Shop, has been evicted.     The Background:   Phil was straight up weird, yos.  He always ended any ring-up with '...is that all fer ya then?'  Also, we were having an auction once, and we asked Phil for a $5.00 gift certificate, and he asked us to give him some time to think about it.     The Recent Events:   A couple of weeks ago, Hal and I were downstairs at our cafe.  Phil had a lien notice taped to his door.  It seems some chip maker sued him in small claims court seeking and obtaining a judgment against him in the astronomical amount of $275.  The Sheriff posted a notice that Phil's failure to pay the outstanding amount left him subject to forfeiture of his property.  Then today, I saw a sign indicating that the space that once held Phil's Snack Shop is now for rent.    Our beloved Phil is gone.    Is that all fer ya then?         "
"            Clean-up Friday Five   By Obsessive Compulsive PB   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?    1) Putting my clothes away.  For some reason, the extra effort of hanging stuff on a hanger puts me over the top.  2) The bathroom floor.  It makes me want to gag.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?    Vacuuming is the best because it's minimal effort and makes the place look 10 times better.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?    I usually keep things pretty tidy and picked up, but when I know I have guests coming into town for the weekend, the heavy-duty cleaning is done.  It also bugs me if I know I have dishes to do, so that's something that I keep up with.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?    The only way you can truly get a floor clean is on your hands and knees.  Mops carry bacteria and just push the dirt around.  I learned this from my Type A mother.   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   I made my bed, put away my laundry, and scrubbed my toilet.  I'm going to be out of town this weekend, but for some reason it's always comforting to come home to a clean john.  I'm weird, I know.  Let me just add, the perk of staying in hotels half my life is that I don't have to clean up after myself.  It's so satisfying to be able to use  all  the towels in the bathroom and then just throw them on the floor.  Hell, I can use a towel for each body part and it doesn't even matter!  Now that's living.          "
"           Friday Five By Duf 'Mr. Clean' Fer   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   I don't like putting laundry away.  I can't figure out what it is, but I have a real block there.  It's horrible.     2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I like to do the dishes.  It is my favorite chore.  I also like to vacuum, and I like dusting and using windex on glass and appliances.     3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   We don't really have a routine.  It's just catch as catch can.  We have a person who comes to help us once a week and she does all the heavy lifting (bathroom, floors, etc.).   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   I am kind of fierce when it comes to scrubbing dishes, and I prefer hand washing to a dishwasher.     5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   Last night I vacuumed to help fight cat hair - my new favorite babysitter has a cat allergy, and I want to help keep the dander down.  This morning, after returning home from taking TinyE to daycare, I did the dishes and took some recycling out.  I also made the bed.           "

"            We All Walk Around with Thresholds  By Dinosaur Duf Fer  Here is the deal with me and the Violent Femmes.  I think we are all allotted a maximum quantity of things in our life.  We walk around everyday with a riding-a-bus threshold, a chick-flick ceiling, and a visit-to-the-mall cap.  Everyone's threshold is different.  For example, DJS's mayonnaise threshold is comically low, while my french fry limit is almost inexhaustible.  My mother will not eat a hot dog, no matter what - she had to live on them when she was a poor college student, and she maxed out.  Anyway, during my college years, I reached my Violent Femmes limit.  I simply cannot hear 'Blister in the Sun' again (although, it must be written that 'American Music' is among the worst songs of all time - it ranks with 'H.W.C.' as being almost as bad as 'Paradise by the Dashboard Lights').  I have heard it 100,000 times already.  It's not that I dislike the Violent Femmes, I'm sure they are just fine.  It's more that I am past my limit with them.    You never know when you are going to max out.  It just happens.  I hit my VF limit in 1987.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  It happened on March 15th at 10:17 a.m.  I was late for my Current American Foreign Policy class, and I was drunk.  My roommate Todd (late for his Comparative Lit class and stoned) took off my slightly warped LP of The Smiths' 'Meat is Murder' and put on the Violent Femmes.  'Gone Daddy Gone' was spinning on our turn table, and I realized I was done.  I couldn't listen anymore.  I'd maxed out.   Historical note:  For you younger Pandylanders a turn table is a machine that is used to play LPs (a.k.a. records).  You see, before .WAV or the MP3 and before the mini disc, in fact, before the compact disc or the cassette tape, there was a music playing device called a record player.  People used it to play records.  You might have seen it at a club where a DJ is 'spinnin' and winnin'.'  Anyway, Duf the dinosaur actually had a record player in college.  As a side note, he graduated never having used a computer.  That's right all of his papers were written on a typewriter, and he used the shit out of white out.           "
"           I like it, Duf, except the first song I heard was a ditty by the Violent Femmes.  I thought you hated those guys (or was it just 'Blister in the Sun')?  I guess no radio station is perfect.         "

"            DJS Should Appreciate This   I've recently applied for a position with a company (that will remain unnamed) in the Twin Cities.  If I would get the position, I would report to a person with the last name of 'Bjork'.  It's fate.  Plus, how cool would it be to address my boss as 'Mr. Bjork'?

"            Wisco Never Sleeps   This just in, from a fellow Wisco-nite we met on Friday after the Cubs game.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what he looked like (give me a break, we were in the bleachers and my friends were buying the beers), but he sounds like fun.  He e-mailed this note to me and the other Sconie girls I was with.  Any of y'all who are in the Chicago area, should stop on by the Alumni Club on Sundays...   'That's right ladies -       Wisco-Nation never lies down and takes a nap; especially on Sundays when perfection strolls out onto the field.  Not everyone is perfect, not everyone can be Brett Favre.  Actually, not everyone knows a lot about football.  But I'm assuming that since you chosen few are from Wisconsin, you might know about a sport called football, and a team in northern Wisconsin that plays just about every Sunday through the fall.  My job is to ensure that all people who enjoy viewing such a sport get the opportunity to do so in the right environment.  Namely, with me and about anyone else I can scrap together in this God-forsaken state (damn FIBs).         Seriously, since moving here I've trekked my ass every Sunday to the Alumni Club on Division for the games.  It's a Bear hang-out, but the owner is from Wisco and plays Green Bay upstairs with the Bears downstairs.  It isn't exactly the classiest bar in Chicago, but the beer is cheap, and I routinely get hammered and throw things.  I've got a few people who are always there with me, and there are always a bunch of people from Wisco who will seem somewhat familiar to me since I got drunk with them 16 Sundays last year.         Drop me an e-mail if you want, or just show up (by the way, I'm the guy from Guthrie's).  There are many things for us to be proud of, being from Wisconsin, and none less than our ability to cheer for Green Bay in a victory, or cloud our brain so heavily with beer that we forget about the loss.'   If my memory serves me right, he was the guy I took a picture with who kept making a 'W' gang-type sign with his hand and was incessantly yelling out 'go Wisco!'.  I'll be the first to admit that Packer fans are obnoxious.  Let's hope Lee Jeans can keep up with me and my family when we're all at Lambeau this Sunday.  He has no idea what he's in for, poor thing.          "
"            We have an epidemic on our hands.   Don't you guys see?  Someone (or an entire group of hatemongers) hates the Pandys, and he/she/they are stealing our bikes to get back at us.  I don't have a bike to steal, but DJS and Bass Babe should be worried.  Whoever this creep is, I hope he/she/they will just leave us alone!!         "
"            Something About the Big City?   Part of the reason I'm trying to escape the throngs of Chicago is because of the mistrust I have for the people around me.  I've learned I can't trust those I work with, those who live in my building, the mayor (espcecially the mayor - he's a corrupt mob-boss), or even my mailman.  Everytime I come home, I see a different note on the front door of my building from someone pleading to have a package returned.  (Our stupid mailman puts our packages in a 'free-for-all' bin, which only encourages this stealing behavior.  Moral of the story: I never have stuff shipped to my house.)  I also recently saw a note on my neighbor's door that indicated it was a felony to steal a neighbor's newspaper (must be a lawyer-type).  How much is a newspaper these days, $.35?  What is wrong with these people?  The last straw happened late last week.  Someone stole my bike out of my building's supposed secure and locked underground garage.  It was locked to itself, but not to anything else, so someone probably just picked it up and put it in their car.  If my bike was a $2000 mountain bike, I could see why someone would want it, but it was a 1975 brown vintage Schwinn with a bent frame and shoddy gears.  Maybe they really liked the Mickey Mouse bell or perhaps one can get big money for vintage bikes on the black market?  Whatever the case, I hope whoever has it now is enjoying it.  The thing is, I'm not mad about someone actually taking the bike. (Although there was a definite sentimental attachment to it - it was the bike my mom used when I was a baby...there used to be a baby seat on the back of it.)  What bothers me is that people are that inconsiderate of other people's things.  I know whoever stole it could probably afford to buy one on their own.  Plus, they probably had a car, which I do NOT have.  And now, I don't have a bike either.  But what makes me saddest is to see posts like Duf's below, because I'm hoping when I move to the Twin Cities, I will not be surrounded by crazy, irrational behavior such as this.  I tried to explain to my parents (who cursed Chicago when they were here over the weekend - they hate the traffic, lack of parking spaces, rude people, and now, especially, whoever stole my bike) that there are assholes everywhere.  I'm just surrounded by MORE PEOPLE, and therefore it  seems  like there are substantially more assholes.  I would bet the percentage of assholes in Appleton, WI is the same as in Chicago.  I still can't wait to move out of this hole.          "
"            He is Bad News/There is No Good Answer  By Africanized Duf Fer  It appears that we have a suspect in our garage break-in (and in the unauthorized use of our charge account).  It is a family friend.  Add to the list of lost items the last remaining (though microscopically small) vestiges of our innocence.  Add to the list of things we have to deal with betrayal and heartbreak.  He is bad news. I called the police and ratted out my friend.  It is amazing how much more dishonesty and disregard hurt us when they come from the hands and words and actions of people who purport to love us.  The friend is the son of a closer friend, and she is wrestling with the question of what to do.  She loves her son, but she needs to get away from him.  He is bad news.  He lies to her more than he speaks truth to her.  He steals from her.  He defrauds her.  He uses her love against her.  She now cannot take him around her friends because he will do the same to them (he was painting our garage recently).  He is bad news.  She needs to simultaneously be there for him (the obligations of parenthood) and keep away from him (the obligations of tough love).  There is no good answer.  He is bad news.    In other news, my niece is removing her eyelashes.  Not a nervous habit, more like an indication of an anxiety disorder.  She is 7 years old.    Finally saw 'Bowling for Columbine' last night.  The part that is really sticking with me:  the whole business about the 'Africanized' Killer Bees.    My next three messages will be shiny and happy.    I promise.           "
"            Happy Halloween, Pandies.    1. What was your first Halloween costume?  It was either a tiger or a bunny.  My mom made me and my brother these costumes and we each wore one or the other (we got to switch each year) until we were about 10.  If you wore the bunny costume, you got pink lipstick on your nose (because all cute, little bunnies have horrible, bright pink snouts).  If you were the tiger?  Bring out the black eyeliner and you got yourself some whiskers.   2. What was your best costume and why?  I wore a slutty nun costume freshman year of college.  Mini-skirt, fish nets, low-cut body suit, and then the veil.  It probably wasn't the best costume, but it definitely gave me a lot of attention.  Especially from some guy at a frat party we went to who was dressed up as a priest.  Of course, we had to make out... because WWJD? (I'm totally going to Level 9 of hell.)   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?  Dumb question.  Next.   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)  Every year we would carve a pumpkin, making a huge mess in the kitchen with all the pumpkin goo.  When my brother and I grew out of trick-or-treating, we would devise plans to scare the neighbor kids.  One year my brother wore oversized clothes, stuffed himself with pillows, and wore a scary mask so he looked like a fake-scarecrow-type guy.  He sat on the porch with the bowl of candy in his lap with a sign in it reading 'Take ONE, please.'  Then our friend across the street hid next to the house with an ax.  Any kid that took more than one piece (which was most of them - stealers) would get the scare of his/her life.  My bro would stand up and bellow 'I  SAID  only ONE piece!' and would chase after them like a zombie.  Then our friend would crawl army style across the lawn with the ax to get the kids from behind.  One time a huge man and his daughter approached the house, with the kid in a wagon.  His daughter was scared to take a piece so the dad said 'There's nothing to be afraid of, honey.  He's not real.'  When he went to get the candy, my bro stood up and scared him shitless.  'Hey man, that's NOT COOL.  NOT COOL at all.' And he raced across the lawn with his crying daughter in the wagon.

"            Room on Fire, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  I got the new Strokes album, 'Room on Fire,' yesterday (its release date), and it is very darn good.  I don't think it is as commercially viable as their debut 'Is This It?', but it is an impressive work.    In my view, their technical skills are neither diminshed nor improved.  They can still rock out, but they don't bring as much energy to the songs here as in the debut.  I think this is intentional.  They are quieting things down a bit, and just as 'Is This It' was a throwback to classic American Rock and Roll, this new piece is an extension with the lights adjusted to effect a different mood.    The opening track 'What Ever Happened?'  Seems like a VH1 joke disguised as a love song and is clearly the high point on the disc.  'I want to be forgotten, and I don't want to be reminded...'  The low point?  There really isn't one.    'Between Love and Hate' is another favorite.  Overall 'Room on Fire' is a solid effort that does not topple the primacy or primal-cy of their original effort but establishes The Strokes as a band with its own distinct and wonderful sound and furthers their effort to resurrect pure American rock-and-roll.

"            You Win Some, You Lose Some   I was in Detroit the last couple days for work.  God help Detroit-ians.  That city, um...really blows.  My boss is an avid gambler, so I was dragged to a casino on Sunday night.  No, not the somewhat nice one across the river in Canada, but an awful hole-in-the-wall in Greektown.  In fact, I think it was called the 'Greektown Casino.'  It was, quite possibly, the worst casino ever.  And this is coming from a girl from Wisco who's seen pretty bad casinos on Indian reservations.  Granted, I'm no gambler.  I headed straight for the nickel slots (in an area of the casino called 'Nickel Heaven.')  My boss bellied up to the craps table and since it was obvious he had no desire to teach me the game, nickel slots were my best alternative.  I was surrounded by blue-hairs, obscenely obese men, street people, and carnies.  This ain't saying much, but I was definitely the most attractive person in the place.  I had to ask some old ladies to show me how the nickel slot games worked - they had surprisingly complicated rules for only having nickel winnings.  I won 250 nickels on a lucky pull.  That's $12.50 in case you're interested.    Since the smoke was really getting to me (one of the blue-hairs offered me a Parliament), and my boss was ignoring me, I thought it was time to cash out.  Plus, they didn't even have free cocktails.  I was lucky enough to get on an earlier flight yesterday to come home.  I was excited to get out of that city ASAP.  I waited by the gate (I was there about 45 minutes before flight time) and didn't hear my flight get called.  All of a sudden, I saw the city change on the digital sign behind the ticket desk.  I ran up there and asked what happened to the flight.  'We just closed the gate.  You can't get on that flight.' 'But I had a ticket!  I never heard you announce boarding!' *type, type, type* [No Apology] 'Here's a ticket for the next flight.' (3 hours later.)  Now, I  know  I wasn't going crazy.  There were other people around me that never heard them board the flight either.  We were pissed.  I called American today and got a $150 voucher and an upgrade to my status.  It pays to be a complainer.  ***************  Duf, a couple things: how was the S&G show?  Also, I have had the Strokes new album on my Amazon wishlist for a while and not  one  bite.

"            Room On Fire/400,000 New Yawkahs Can't be Wrong  By Duf Fer  The new Strokes disc:  'Room on Fire' is out tomorrow.  Word is bond.  Tonight, Mrs. Duf and I are going to the Simon and Garfunkel show in St. Paul.  Simon and Garfunkel are a 'pop' duo that rose to fame in the 60's and 70's with hits like 'Mrs. Robinson' 'Sounds of Silence' and 'Bridge over Troubled Water.'  One half of the duo 'Paul Simon' went on a fine solo career that included hits like 'You can Call Me Al' and 'Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes.'  Simon and Garfunkel's songs were the soundtrack to the popular movie 'The Graduate' starring a young up and comer named Dustin Hoffman (who went on to star in such films as 'Tootsie' and 'Kramer vs. Kramer.').  S & G held a concert in New York City's fabled Central Park and 400,000 people went (it was free).    Don't hate.           "
"            I'm With DJS   Getting old is a double-edged sword.  I can't wait to retire.  But then I can definitely wait to be put in a home to 'live' the rest of my days.  Billygoat's poor grandfather is about 93 now.  Whenever I ask him (BG) how his grandfather is, he says something (tragically) funny like 'well, he just had  another  birthday.' or 'My parents are basically waiting for him to pass away so they can finally go on a vacation.' (Grandfather lives with his parents.)  The poor man seems to just keep on ticking.  He has what BG's parents call 'mini-strokes' every other week.  He recently had to get one of his legs amputated because of bed sores.  He sometimes forgets he doesn't have this leg and takes a leap out of his chair to go to the bathroom.  If I get to that point, bring me out into the backyard and take me out 'Old Yeller' style.  Please.  If you're bored today (like Rob and I are), check out  urlLink these videos .  Our favorite is 'Hey Ya.'  Outkast is so great.         "
"            I Don't Want To Get Old by DJ Shovelpants   All right, I'm not saying I want to die soon or anything, but I really don't want to get really old...and feeble...and helpless.  Last night I met up with my FTO (Field Training Officer) at the fire department to go over some stuff I missed in class on Monday (while I was rockin' with the EELS).  I got to tear around town in one of the trucks (a DJS first) and go through an obstacle course we set up, open up a hydrant, spray about 500 gallons of water around, the works.  It was a great night to catch up on stuff.  Did it all in about an hour and a half.  I got home and was about to turn around to meet DJ LZ and Darb at the local watering hole when my pager chirped:   'Station XXXX please respond to 123 Fake Address Drive for a medical emergency.  93 year old woman, vomiting, may be unconcious...'   What to do?  Do I go and eat chicken wings or do I head back to the station and possibly help save a life?  I opted for the station.  I got on the ambulance in the nick o' time and we tore off on a Code 3 (that's light and sirens).  At the house, an old woman was hunched over the kitchen table with an oxygen mask on.  She lived with her middle-aged plus daughter and immediately I could smell it.  The smell of old age.  Urine.  Feces.  Oldness.  The woman was a withered and fragile husk of what she had once been and there was a crowd of people (police/paramedics, EMTs, us) doing all kinds of stuff for her.  Because I'm still a trainee, I couldn't do much, but we loaded her onto the ambulance and I could smell that she hadn't asked to go to the bathroom.  Some of the veterans in the department would call that a Code Brown.  I guess it's funny when you don't smell it.  The ride to the hospital was absolutely crazy.  Doing 80 miles an hour, sitting around a poor old woman, who quite frankly, just wanted to die.  The paramedic was asking me for help and I was almost afraid to do anything.  I haven't even start EMT classes yet!   'Hand me 500 mg of sodium chlroride and tubing.  When I give the signal, I'm going to need you to spike the bag, bleed it off and then hand me the needle.'   Errr....right.  The woman's arm was bleeding from a IV that didn't take and I was holding a piece of gauze on there.  Meanwhile we're barreling toward White Bear Lake.  The paramedic kept putting her hand on the old woman's head and assuring her that she was going to be okay.  Oddly, I don't think she wanted to be okay.  After all was said and done, we delivered her to the hospital, barely intact but alive.  We talked a bit afterwards and the paramedic/cop asked me how long I'd been on.  When I told her a little over a month and a half, she just about shit.  With my FTO right there, she said I 'worked well under pressure.'  Cool.  But still...I don't want to get old.  If I'm looking like I'm ready for the dirt nap.  Just let me go, man...         "

"           DJS, allow me to explain.  Lost In Translation is a slow movie - you're not *missing* anything by walking away from it with that impression.  In my opinion, it was blissfully slow.  How do you convey boredom and isolation with a fast pace?  You don't.  While I didn't find it boring, I can see where others might.  It's a quiet movie about having everything and nothing, being alone in a crowd, Japan, karoke, platonic love, marriage, and friendship.  And Bill Murray.  And fax machines.  It's also an adventure movie - not in the 'Goonies' sense, but in the 'out with people you don't know, in an unfamiliar place, not knowing what the night will lead to' sense.  So we will agree to disagree... I didn't find it boring.  But we'll agree to agree that Bill Murray is beyond great.          "
"            Thanks.   I feel like I'm 112 years old.  This aging shit is for the bird.  For...the...birds.  Let me throw some random stuff at you:   Elliott Smith:  Don't know him, didn't know him, probably won't miss him.  He did some song for 'Good Will Hunting' which (the movie) was grossly overrated.  Enjoy your time, El.  Oops.  Too late.   Kill Bill Vol. 1:  I thought it was fun.  There were some parts I could've done without (see: Sonny Chiba scene about getting the tea) and others that I'll probably think about for some time.  Yeah, it's not an important movie and one could definitely live without seeing it, but I thought it was a damn good time.  (Closed Circuit to Duf: The nurse?  That was Daryl Hannah)  I'll take Lucy Liu any day...you know, if I wasn't engaged or what-not.   Lost In Translation  - Saw it Saturday night and I've took two things away from it.  1. Bill Murray is a genius.  The acting was superb and I'd love to see him get a delicious nomination from his performance.  2. The movie was easily the most boring movie I've seen in some time.  This must've been the pitch:   Okay, so I've got this idea for a movie.  Two people are stuck in Japan and they're bored.  They sort of like each other because they've got a few things in common.  What do you think?   If I'm not getting something from this movie, go ahead and e-mail me and clear it right up.  djshovelpants@yahoo.com           "

"            Once Again Back is the Controversial  By Duf 'I love DJS' Fer  OK, ready?  I saw 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1' and I thought it was OK just O...K...  I liked it well enough, but in my view it was ice cold.  There was not much warmth in it at all.  I thought all the acting was good.  I liked the fight scenes.  The 'stylized' violence that everyone talks about was fine.  I could look at Uma's butt for another hour or so at least.  Even with all that though, I dunno, it's hard to explain, but Bill just left me flat.    I read a review in the New Yorker (hated it) and one in the City Pages (loved it), and understood how both arrived at their different opinions.  The New Yorker reviewer said that after he left, he felt nothing and even called the film crap.  The City Pages mentioned the homage to Kung Fu cinema and Brian DePalma (notably the nurse scene - who IS that actress by the way?, I want to give up my current life and follow her especially if she will do that homicidal nurse bit for me) and the use of colors and angles.    By the way, here is a quote from City Pages that will prove DJS right and prove me right too (just kidding, we all know critics are assholes, and only an asshole would quote an asshole to make a point):   But I had no idea that Tarantino possessed the skills to sustain a near-unbearable emotional intensity at the same time. Kill Bill Vol. 1 isn't a career high: Tarantino's masterwork remains Jackie Brown, a haunting tale of careworn love buried in a pulp-novel graveyard. But in its meticulous craftsmanship and jacked-up cinephilic energy, Vol. 1 might be the most viscerally and emotionally overwhelming B movie ever made.    I felt that Uma Thurman did a great job, and I am totally in love with Lucy Liu.  I will see Vol. 2, but I did not think this was one of his best efforts.    Opinion.  DJS:  That Eels show sounds like a little slice of heaven.    Hal:  I'm synchin' right now.  Oh the joys!  BB King:  I miss you.  Call or write.  Panda:  Sorry I missed your MN engagement (two nights only!).           "

"            Wow.  Tough Crowd.   Hey kids.  Just got back from Madison, Sconie (ooh...I hate that) where I saw quite possibly one of the coolest concerts of my life.  Of course, I'm talking about the EELS.  Who did you think?  The friggin' Eagles?  Please...  They played Monday night at a club called Luther's Blues which is like a cross between First Avenue and Chammps (you know, those restaurants?).  Small, small venue.  Just the way DJ likey.  There was an opening act, DJ Honky, who is basically a side project for EELS front man Mark Oliver Everrett, also known as E.  The guy was dressed like an old man who spun records and basically just smoked his pipe and stood there.  Hilarious.  Twenty minutes later, the EELS hit the stage.  Kool G Murder on bass, Puddin' on drums, and some new guy called Chet the 3rd on lead guitar.  But where was E?  Coming through the crowd, riding on someone's shoulders and playing a harmonica was our lead singer.  Dressed in jean jacket and tough guy glasses (which he never removed once) he took the stage and they tore through 5 songs before he even said 'Hello, Madison.'  I went with my partner in crime Dirty Abbott (which makes 2 successful concert road trips this year) and we stood literally 3 feet from the Mr. E.  They had set lists taped to the stage that were designed to throw people off.  Namely, they didn't play a single song off the list.  Classic.  I scored a guitar pick and Dirty got hit in the face with a flying drumstick.  He was asking for it.  The EELS tore through many of my favorite cuts on their albums, including my favorite 'Mr. E's Beautiful Blues.'   The smokestacks spittin' black soot into the sooty sky The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage  Uh-huh God damn right, it's a beautiful day  Uh-huh God damn right, it's a beautiful day,  Uh-huh    The real bonus?  4 encores, including one with the lights up and most of the crowd gone.

"            Blown out of Proportion   I was watching the Early Show this morning (to catch a glimpse of  urlLink my beloved , of course) and they had an interview about Steve Bartman, the poor sap who is now part of Cubs lore.  Except they didn't actually interview  him , they interviewed his fricking  neighbors .  And then his written apology was aired, spoken not by  him , but his  brother .  Isn't this 'man shrouded in mystery' stuff just a little too much?  I think it's making an even bigger deal of it, personally.  Even the Cubs themselves have emphasized he shouldn't be blamed.    Whatever.  I'm over it.  One of the guys I work with is a stand-up comedian on the side.  He had a show at the  urlLink Gotham Comedy Club  last night, which I attended.  So instead of crying my eyes out watching the Cubs lose last night, I was laughing it up to about 7 comics.  My friend was killer funny.  It's weird because his day-job is so not funny (he's in my department.  I can vouch for that.).  It's like he became a different person on stage.  And here I thought I was going to have to heckle him.          "
"            Honestly   I was pretty interested in the whole curse thing and the poor, dumb, nerdy son of a bitch who is Chicago's most hated.  I learned quite a bit about the goat curse and how it was placed on the dirty ol' Cubs and honestly, from a 30+ year old kid who can't resist a good story...I was intrigued.  I actually felt sorry for the guy and watch some of the news this morning and heard some of the fans reactions to what happened.   'I wanted to fire that asshole (tastefully bleeped) down!'   Once sausage-eating Chicago asshole muttered.   'He should be kilt!'   Yeah, that's how he said 'killed' it's a Chicago thing, I think.  Poor asshole.  That's what he got for being a superfan.  Not only was he at the game to watch his favorites superjocks run around in their gay little stirrups, he was also listening to it on the radio and sadly...he never saw it coming.  So I admit.  I was engaging in some baseball talk a bit today.  Okay, so maybe it was around 10-15 minutes worth (all told).  If this kind of thing (or something like it) was guaranteed to happen every game, I'd become a fan.  Until then?  No time.         "
"            I think only Duf wants my reaction   I have a feeling most readers don't care what I think about the Cubs (DJS may fit into this category).  But if you  need  to know, initially I wanted to rip that clown's head off.  I'm sure if I would have been at the game, I would have thrown my beer at him like everyone else.  But then I thought about it.  What's a baseball fan's first reaction when a ball is coming towards him/her?  To reach out for it and try to grab it (or at least protect yourself from it).  Sure, 'that fan' could have taken the high road and stepped back from it, all while trying to get everyone else to back up too, but most likely there would have been some other idiot trying to jump over these people to get his hands on a championship ball.  I think it was instinct, and he went for it, especially because the ball looked like it was out of play.  It's unfortunate, but you can't tell me the same thing couldn't happen again.  And that one instance did  not  cost the Cubs the game.  This was not the only chance the Cubs had to recover.  How about the bobbled possible double play?  No one is threatening to kill Alex Gonzalez (the dumb fool).  It was a terrible, unbelievable upset.  (Not that I  care , or anything...)  So how 'bout those Red Sox?  Will the curse be lifted?         "

"            Ah, the Power of Persuasion   Duf, you are my hero.  You are probably one of the only smug marrieds I know to acknowledge this injustice.  And here I thought I'd be accused of having a huge chip on my shoulder....  But I used my single status to my advantage last night.  After bringing up my problem to several front desk staff members and to a few managers, I finally clawed my way to the top - the GM of the Marriott Courtyard Midtown East - basically the CEO of the hotel.  I explained what had happened and expressed my fear as a 'single woman alone in [her] hotel room...'  I also used my 'preferred customer status' at Marriott chains (I'm a silver member, the lowest of statuses, but status just the same).  I reminded him that I spend thousands of dollars at his hotel, and because of this 'incident' I may be forced to not book here again.  'Ms. Panda, we are at your mercy. [No lie - those were his exact words.]  What can we do for you?  A free breakfast, perhaps?'  I went for the gold.  'I want a free night.'  An hour later, the GM met me in the lobby.  'I have comped all charges from last night.'  Score one for the single lady.  I got a $250/night room for free.           "
"            It  Is  Discrimination (with a stunning surprise ending)  By Duf Fer  I have been meaning to respond to your post from a few days ago, Panda, and have not found time to type my thoughts (what with the Jackie Brown imbroglio and all).  Anyway, I wanted to say that it  is  discrimination in the workplace when you treat someone differently because of their marital/parental status.  I was talking to Hal about it, and these are my thoughts:  Being married (in and of itself) should not make a difference in how people are treated at work.  However, I feel I am treated differently (better) at work because I am married.  I think people take married folks more seriously, and I think our society tends to root for families (read married people).    People with kids are torn.  You usually have to leave by a set time (I get away with it because Mrs. Duf is extraordinarily supportive and has a job where she is done every day at the same time) and be with your youngins.  Heres whats different.  Everyone knows you have a child, and everyone knows it means that sometimes you will not be able to stay late or take that trip.  I should note that there is an expectation that fathers will have work as a slightly higher priority than home and will still go the extra mile.  The bread-winner expectation is still there.  I feel it a lot a work (a lot of folks I work with are childless  we have an amazingly, disproportionately high number of DINKs here).  When I take a half day because my daughter is sick, I don't expect anyone to take up my slack, but I do feel that some folks wonder why Mrs. Duf isn't doing it instead of me.  Single people without kids have a tougher time because people at work tend to assume that they have nothing else to do except burn the midnight oil.  That is a yucky assumption.   When I read your piece Panda, I was thinking about my situation at work.  There are two people who have my job title.  Me (married for 3 years with 1 child) and my counterpart (married for 25 years, 2 kids are grown and out of the house).  The easy assumption is that my counterpart can come in whenever she wants and leave whenever she wants.  I stroll in around nine (hey, Hal set the standard) and people know it is because I have to get my daughter up and dressed and to daycare (much more time consuming than you would think  I wake everyday at 6:00 and I cant get to work until 9:00 when all is said and done).  But her life is still full of obligations.  She moved to a new house, she broke her foot, and she has a sister up north in the middle of an awesome battle against cancer.  My whole point:  we need to move to place where we dont consider marital status (or parental status) in the workplace.  We should not assume that because someone is single and childless that work is the only thing that have to do.     Surprise ending:  Panda and I are in AGREEMENT!           "

[closed circuit to Panda:  Hal and I were in Dallas/Fort Worth, and the Hilton checked me into a room that was already occupied.  When I opened the door an authoritative woman yelled 'WHO IS IT?' and I nearly wet myself.  You see, a black man breaking into hotel rooms in Texas...yep, that's grounds for being shot dead - no Dallas jury would have convicted her.  Anyway, at the Hilton, your reward when that happens is that you get a free movie.

"            At the End of my Tether   I told myself I was no longer going to be negative about traveling, my job, etc...but this story is so 'last straw', it would be crazy not to share it.  I checked into a Marriott hotel last night.  I was exhausted so I went right to bed.  At 3:00am, somebody came into my room.  Let me repeat that:  somebody used a keycard and walked right into my room .  I shot out of bed (in a total state of fear and confusion) and yelled 'Um, HELLO!'  I then heard a woman's voice - 'Somebody's already in there!' - and she closed the door.  Baffled, I immediately called the front desk.  'I think you just checked someone into  my room !  What the hell is wrong with you?'  'We're sorry ma'am.  They should be coming down right now and we'll take care of the situation.'  The 'SITUATION'??  Someone was in my room!  That is the biggest mistake a hotel could make!    I couldn't sleep for a while, but eventually fell back asleep around 4.  The phone rang an hour later.  I thought it was my wake-up call, so I picked it up and then hung it up.  The phone rang again.  This time I put the receiver to my ear. 'Um, we weren't sure if your wake-up call was at 5 or 6.'  'Actually, it was at  6:30  so you're wrong all the way around.  Please don't tell me it's 5am right now.'  'Ah, ma'am.  It's 5am.'  Because I had been woken out of a deep sleep, I was a bit irrational.  'YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL COMPLETELY RETARDED!' *click*  Needless to say, my sleep last night was not good.  I stormed to the front desk this morning and told the manager on duty what had happened.  He gave me no recovery statement like 'Oh, we're so sorry - here's a free weekend coupon.'  All he said?  'I'll check into it.'  What the hell is there to check into??  Those are the facts - you think I'd make this up?  What I can be thankful for: the person who came in my room was a sober woman.  A drunk man would have been even more scary.  Also, it could have been worse if they checked the person in at say, 10pm, and I wasn't even in the room, but all my stuff was.  But maybe I shouldn't be so hard on the Marriott.  Perhaps they have a new policy when they're oversold: pairing random strangers up for the night??         "
"            Put me in the corner for Jackie Brown.     I don't remember too much (it's been some years), but what I remember most is that I had not heard good things about it, and I almost didn't see it.  Then when I saw it I couldn't believe that it wasn't getting great word-of-mouth.  Anyway... I can't believe there is all this talk of QT, and no mention of his guest spot on the first season of 'Alias'!  The man is a poor actor who should stick behind the camera (aside from his cameo in 'Pulp Fiction', which was one of the best director's cameos of all time, though I admit that's not saying much).  But he was more than good as a man out for revenge, a bad-guy after a worse bad-guy on 'Alias'.         "
"            I Love DJS  By Duf Fer  One of my main criticisms of American movies (hold on, I have to adjust my beret, it was about to slide off my big head) is that they feel the need to jam every moment with action. There has to be a kick, an explosion, a boob, a fantastic line, a  something  in every minute or the audience might become bored and go to the multi-million dollar action extravaganza instead.  Jackie Brown from one of our more explosive action directors, gives proof of Tarantinos versatility.  The opening moment, with Jackie on the moving walkway, I loved for three reasons (and we part company here, so there really isnt much point is going too much further):  1.  It sets up a very deliberate pace that Tarantino carries through the entire film (including the scene at the department store where pace is everything).  2.  It compels you to sympathize with this middle-aged black woman who works for a crap airline and makes a crap wage and has to hustle to make the rents.  In the same opening, when she starts to run so that she wont be late for work, I thought, man, when Im in my late 40s, I pray to God Im not a clock puncher who had to run to avoid being late for work.  3.  It pays homage (oh Tarantino and the homage) to all the Blaxploitation films that gave Pam Grier her fame.    4.  Okay, one more thing, the song in the background, Bobby Womacks Across 110th Street, thats the jam right there, son.  Thats the jam.  Also, the words are trying to tell you something.  I could go on and on about Jackie Brown, but I wont.  Suffice it to say that of his movies, it is by far the most  believable  to me.  I believe there are people like Jackie just trying to survive in Bushs America (oops, sorry for the slipmy beret got in my eyes while I was typing).  And Pam Grier, in my view, was absolutely dogged by the awards.  Her performance was off the hook (so was Robert Forsters).  I think that when the pace is a bit slower, it is easier to appreciate the acting, and this film is about controlled pace and controlled acting, both of which were handled extremely well by experts.     Like a brother,  Duf         "
"            Color Me Slayed.   Yeah, reasonable minds can definitely disagree...but be reasonable!  'Jackie Brown?'  Better than 'Reservoir Dogs?'  I don't quite know how to stomach that.  I feel as though someone wound up and punched me in the gut with everything they had.  Whoa.  I'll ask you what I ask a lot of people that enjoyed movies that I just can't stand:  What  did  you like about it?     If I may, I'll present a laundry list of problems with the movie (and please remember that I only saw it once.  one times too many)  - Length: Wasn't it like 3 hours long?  Why? Get an editor! - Characters: Not a single character that I liked, not even remotely. - Premise: I must've missed it.  Was there one? - Pam Grier: Yes, she's an icon to some.  Do we really need to see a static shot of her face on a motorized walkway for 15 minutes?  For my buck, 'Reservoir Dogs' is still Quentin's best film.  It's the building block on which almost all of his other work has been built.  Dogs totally redifined the way movies are shot, stories are told, and how what you don't see is as important as what you do.  Besides, (and not that this is a selling point) do you remember any really quotable lines from Jackie Brown?  I could go on for days with classic lines from RD.  But I won't.  If I were to list the QT scale, it'd go a little something like this:  1. Reservoir Dogs 2. True Romance 3. Pulp Fiction 4. Kill Bill Vol. 1 5. From Dusk Til Dawn 6. Four Rooms (at least his 'room') 7. Natural Born Killers 26. Jackie Brown  (I've left space between the mostly rotten Natural Born Killers and Jackie Brown for any Broadway plays, infomercials, or home movies that he might release between now and then.)   Diff'rent strokes for different, etc...          "
"            Huh?  by Duf Fer  I like Quentin Tarantino.  I like him quite a lot.  He is creative and hip and has a style all his own (okay, a penchant for homage all his own).  I have not seen 'Kill Bill Vol. 1', and if current babysitter trends hold, I will have to wait until video.  At any rate, I must comment in response to my boy DJS who describes 'Jackie Brown' as an atrocity.  Huh?  I did not read the Elmore Leonard book, but I loved 'Jackie Brown'.  That's cool, reasonable minds can disagree.  The main thing is, if you are going to pick examples of QT films that are atrocities, you pick 'Four Rooms,' you pick 'From Dusk 'til Dawn,' (so what if he didn't direct it) but you don't pick 'Jackie Brown.'    Here comes the slayer:  'Jackie Brown' is a better movie than 'Reservoir Dogs.'  Here, I'll illustrate it...  Here's QT's top three (in order - and I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 1):  Pulp Fiction Jackie Brown Reservoir Dogs  Yours,   Duf         "
"            William   HAL & Co.,  I saw 'Kill Billiam' on Saturday.  It's easily one of the most violent movies I've seen in a long, long time.  And I loved it!  It's nice to see him do something actually watchable after that atrocity 'Jackie Brown' where he took all of the good parts of a mediocre Elmore Leonard book and threw them out to film the rest of the garbage.  'Kill Bill' was frantic, fun and loaded with such over-the-top action and killings that I found myself laughing harder than the morons in the theatre who were snorting over the 'Scary Movie 3' trailer.     (Side note: If you see me at a theatre and I'm holding a ticket stub for 'Scary Movie 3' go right ahead and plug a gun into my eye and squeeze, baby, squeeze.  I'd rather watch a buffalo shit.)   Back to 'Bill.'  If you don't mind countless slayings, spurting stumps, Lucy Lui (yes, delicious) and fakey comic book style action, than you really owe it to yourself to see this movie.  Is it the best movie of the year?  No.  So far 28 Days Later has that honor (until Return of the King hits).  Is it Oscar calibur?  No.  God, no.  But it's a lot of fun.         "
"           I haven't seen any of the movies on Panda's list... but I have to agree with the fun of a weekend movie marathon.  Has anyone seen 'Kill Bill'?  It sounds like the second coming, but I haven't spoken to anyone who's seen it.         "
"            I Watch Movies to Escape   I love the feeling I get when I bring home rented movies (usually 4 at a time).  When the MGM Lion pops up on the screen, it's as if nothing can go wrong (for at least the next 2 hours or so).  I block out everything - phone calls, e-mails, loud neighbors - to watch a story unfold.  Here's what I got lost in this weekend:   urlLink The Dangerous Life of Altar Boys : Kieran Culkin strikes again, this time as an angry 14-year-old in a story about growing up under the oppressive authority of the Catholic church in the 1970's.  There are animated sequences that interrupt the flow, but I loved the realism of the rest of the movie - not sugar coated at all.  Jodie Foster as a one-legged nun?  Priceless.   urlLink Comedian :  This is a documentary about passion.  Jerry Seinfeld and the other comedians featured in this film adore what they do - including the blood, sweat, and tears behind it all.  Seinfeld has surely followed his bliss.   urlLink The Smokers : A dark comedy about a group of girls who enact revenge on the boys who mistreated them.  My bottom line reaction to this film: garbage.  But I love Oliver Hudson (the hottie who played Joey's boyfriend in  Dawson's  and the brother of Kate Hudson), so that saved it for me.  That, and I could somehow relate to  urlLink Busy Phillips'  character.   urlLink Tuesdays With Morrie : Initially I picked this up and laughed.  A movie based on an Oprah Book Club book?  No way could I watch this.  But at my independent video store I get 'rent one, get one free,' so this was my freebie.  And surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  And I cried my eyes out.  At one point, Morrie quoted the poet Auden, 'Love each other or perish.' He also asked these 4 questions:  Have you found someone to share your heart with?  Are you giving to your community?  Are you at peace with yourself?  Are you trying to be as human as you can be?    This will probably be my last post for a while.  Be good, kiddos.         "
"            A Different Kind of Discrimination   While I was in training this week, I overheard one of my coworkers talking about traveling for a former job. 'I had to go to Florida for 2 weeks a month and then I would come home for 2 weeks.  And this lasted THREE MONTHS!'  I leaned over to him and half-jokingly said, 'Hey, R-man, try that schedule for  three years .'  His reply?  'Oh, Panda.  It's no big deal for you.  I mean, it's not like you are married or have kids like I do.'  Hold it right there, bud.  Just because I'm  single  means I don't have the right to have a normal life?  Why? Because there couldn't  possibly  be anyone who cares about me or needs me back home?  And on a side note, perhaps I'm single  because  I'm on the road  all the fucking time .  Single people are forced into staying later at work. (I gotta get my kid from daycare  have fun staying until midnight to finish that PowerPoint presentation!) Single people don't get to stay home because the nanny called in sick.  Single people supposedly have no reason to take advantage of the benefit of 'working from home.'  Single women get ogled and asked out at work (Im hoping thats just the pervs I work with).     closed circuit to Duf: of course these are generalities - you'd stay late at the office if needed.  Dont hate.          "

"            Wicked Awesome  By Duf 'TV' Fer  Last night, I was (like all God-fearing Americans) watching baseball on the telly when Mrs. Duf interrupted me with an urgent request - 'go get groceries.'     Editor's Note:  Mrs. Duf was NOT watching baseball and is irretrievably communistic and atheistic.   I said 'no problem, I'll go after the game.'  Said she 'no, go now.  I need you to go to Whole Foods for the 100% vitamin C applesauce and they close at 10:00.'     Editor's Note:  no, I'm not kidding.   I thought 'but it's the middle of the game, and the Sox are leading!' I also thought about the nature of communism and how it has been exposed as a failed philosophy and governmental system.  I concluded that socialism is really the best route, though it should be tested in less homogenous nations.  Can it thrive in a former capitalistic nation where income hierarchies have become accepted?  I considered cutting my toenails; they are a bit long.  I also thought about Nomar Garciaparra's pre-hit routine.  Boy is it bizarre.  But what I said was 'no problem honey.  I love you.  You are the hydrogen to my oxygen.  Together we support an entire undersea world and form an essential ingredient for life.  Without you, I am incomplete.  You are the wind beneath my wings, and I never want to let you down.  I want our love to be a beacon in the night shining as an example of love and devotion for all the world.  And can I have a  treat  when I get back?'  She said 'no.  But you can put the groceries and dishes away.'    Ah...wedded bliss.  Solution:  I took my mini portable TV (you know the ones with the 2 inch screen, right?) and watched the game while I shopped.    My Whole Foods fellow shoppers all stared at me and I responded by asking 'how can you judge me?  I'm only driving the Subaru Outback while I save up for a Volvo!!!  Give me a break!!!'.    One guy asked me for a score update.  I told him that the Sox just hit a home run to make is 5 to 0, and we watched the replay together.    Only in America.  Go Red Sox! Go Cubbies!  Then go Red Sox in the World Series!  (Sorry Panda...I know we will find common ground some day!)           "

"           First off, this is not the forum I wish to debate in, nor do I wish to debate at all.  I was merely discussing a different perspective - not claiming it as 'the ultimate truth', but as something different from what the media tells us.  It's a good idea to get information from all sources - CNN, Fox News, NY Times, or one marine - and my point was that too many people take a biased look at something without seeing both sides.  For instance,  urlLink this  is something interesting I've read recently.  Another media source that should not to be taken as the end-all-be-all, but to be read with a grain of salt.  Politics, violence in society, and foreign policy is not my forte, and I'm not going to pretend I know everything about such matters.  So I won't.         "
"           Setting aside for a moment how reluctant I am to accept the word of one marine as gospel truth.  And also neglecting a conversation we could have about media as a tool of propaganda (and guess who wields the tool), let me respectfully and cordially disagree.  Saddam's regime was oppressive and criminal.  There is international (and overwhelming) consensus around that point.  Iraq is well rid of him.  Again, everyone agrees.    This is where the disagreement begins.  Some argue, myself among them, that our justifications for the war were dishonest.    First, if Saddam's oppressiveness is our justification for war in Iraq, two thoughts come to mind.  First, now that he is out of power, why don't we leave?  Second, it's time to start attacking (pre-emptively) all those other countries suffering under fascists.  There are unspeakable tragedies taking place all over the world.  And on the despot depth chart, Saddam wouldn't even be on the JV team.    Second, there is no link between Iraq and Al Queda.  If that was our justification for war, we would be in Saudi Arabia right now.  The link between Saudia Arabia and Al Queda is much more clear and much stronger.  Third, there are (as yet) no found Weapons of Mass Destruction.  After initially discovering them in 1991, we eradicated them and were able to contain Saddam for years.  We pretty much knew he did not have WMD, and that if he did, he had no vehicle to deliver them, which brings me to my next point...  Fourth, there is no evidence that Iraq was (as we were told or 'manipulated into thinking') a direct threat to the United States.  I don't even think an argument could be made that they were a credible threat to Israel. (Some argue that Dr. Paul Wolfowitz and the other neo-cons were really interested in stability in the region and in protecting Israel).  At any rate, as a result, the whole justfication for the war was (at minimum) ill founded and (more likely) fabricated.  If I had a child in the military serving in Iraq, my outcry would be deafening.  I'm all for military service but I can never support the use of our fighting men and women for any cause that is not well founded.  This cause is not well founded.   The reason our soldiers are still being shot  may  have to do with a fanatical minority that hates us, when (perhaps) a majority loves us.  To me, though, it is more likely that now that the despot has fallen, Iraqis want us to get the heck out of there so that they can go about the business of true self rule.  Isn't that another part of our justification for going - to restore Iraq to self rule?  I believe that a lot of Iraqis feel we don't belong there.  They are right, and, to tell the truth, we never did.  They know that our motives are impure.  The whole world knows our motives are impure.  Americans who read the paper know our motives are impure.  And international challenges to prove otherwise have been unanswered by our current administration.   Last, to reply to your side note.  Asking why the poor in this country shoot each other is fine, but we must also ask, more generally, why Americans shoot each other.  There is a lot of violence in our poor communities (I say it is linked to a cycle of violence, a lack of meaningful opportunity, economic injustice, crime, drugs, human frailty, easy access to guns, a culture obsessed with guns, poor leadership and rap music - it's the type of problem it would take about $87,000,000,000 to fix), but there is also a lot of violence in American in general.  Why did Columbine happen?  Why did that one guy shoot his pregnant wife then try to escape to Mexico?  Why did that kid bring a gun to school in Minnesota and kill a classmate and severly wound another?  What explains the snipers?    The way I see it, violence is no longer the exclusive province of the poor. We are a violent people.  Our continued support of the death penalty, our unjust and unjustified pre-emptive strike againt Iraq, our passion for violent games and movies and sports and music, our tendency to shoot each other, it all proves the same point.           "
"           My marine friend went home to home while he was in Iraq as a 'community service' and got a good idea of the Iraqi view towards America(ns): 30% are very pro-American (these people threw down their best rugs when he visited their homes), about 65% are indifferent, while only about 5% of the Iraqis are very against us being there.  These 5% are mostly the poorer citizens, the ones who are hopeless...these also include non-Iraqis - people who cross the border from Syria and other countries.  It's unfortunate that we are manipulated by our leaders and our media in thinking an entire country(s) hates us.  Even though it's a small percentage of people who disagree with us being there, since hate is so powerful, it may seem like more?  I don't have the answer.  But I do have a question: Why do the poor in  this  country shoot each other?  (rhetorical question, most likely)         "

"            A Different Perspective   I'm in NY this week and went out with some friends a couple nights ago.  Among these people was a 'friend of a friend' who I really enjoyed talking to.  He was visiting NY and on a vacation from his MBA program in California.  When I asked him how he got the time off, he said he was taking a semester off and was on leave from the Marines.  He had just returned from Iraq.  I didn't ask a lot of questions since I was sure he was inundated every day with the inane opinions of people who were never there, could never understand, and everything they knew about the situation they got from the 10:00 news.  So I just said, 'that must have been an indescribable experience.'  I asked him to give me the statement he gave to anyone who asked 'how it was'.  'What I found out, more than anything, was how lucky we are to live in the United States.  The media has been misleading.  The Iraqis cheered for us in each town we went through.  They are supportive of our help and a chance for freedom.'          "
"            Beware Freaks Bearing Gifts  By Depressed Duf'  It never ceases to amaze me how those who trumpet patriotism with words are also those who debase it most with their actions.    In Washington, some Senior White House official has ratted out a spy.  This is counter-espionage.  This is treason.  This is the opposite of 'united we stand.'  The USA Patriotism Act is an assualt on personal freedom and the bill of rights that would make Mussolini blush.    In California, a long standing tradition of respecting the voice of the people was ended by a recall of a Governor (unpopular though he was) who had committed no crime or malfeasance of any kind.  Last night, farce concluded the tragedy; vox populi became pox populi.  May we get the elected officials we deserve.  My favorite piece though is that while states all over America are rushing to make students recite the pledge of allegiance, our transition team in Iraq is working to remove dogma and patriotism from the schools there.  Apparently, in Iraq, style over substance is disfavored, and a return to educating children means decreasing time devoted to anything except the three R's.  I like the pledge of allegiance.  I don't think anyone should be forced to say it (that pesky first amendment and all), but the pledge, in and of itself will do little to make children understand or love America.  For that, I think we should favor more substantive things.  Of course, it would mean a shift away from words and toward action.         "

"            You'd think I'd have an inferiority complex...    1. What vehicle do you drive?   I don't.  I don't have a car.  How do I get around?  Bus, subway, cab, train, and airplane.  Don't hate.   2. How long have you had it?   I  haven't  had a car for almost 3 years.  Some of the best years of my life.  No worries, no payments, and I never have to be the designated driver.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   What's cool about the bus - sometimes you get crazy drivers who won't let  anyone  get in their way.  Near-death experiences are a great way to start the day.   I like cabs because cabbies always have NPR on, they know the quickest ways around the city and to the airport, and they tell you interesting stories about why they came to America.  Trains are great - esp the Amtrak to Milwaukee.  Everytime I go to M-city I see the same guy who hands out snacks and tells us when we've crossed over into 'America's Dairyland.' He sometimes gives me a free Heineken.  I hate planes.  Nothing cool about them at all.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   You get the crazies on the bus.  Once I saw a homeless lady throw-down on a business man because he tried to sit next to her.  Funniest shit ever.  (He wasn't hurt, the cops came on and threw her off.)  Sometimes cabs can really reek.  Bad.  Either with BO or about 10 of those hanging vanilla tree things.  I don't know who told these guys quantity was better than quality.     5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  One of the biggest things I'm  not  looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  But I know I'll have to get one.  It's a car town.    I'm going to change this question a bit and tell you the car I would buy if the  weather  was no object.  (I'm talking about horrible, Midwestern, snowy weather.)  I would get a  urlLink Mini Cooper .  Sure, it might make me look like an clown, but it would be fun as hell.   Let's motor.         "
"            Start Yer Engines, Yo.     1. What vehicle do you drive?   2002 Nissan Xterra, black.   2. How long have you had it?   1 year plus a month or two.    3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   It's corny, but I love that dumb little first aid kit hanging in the rear door.  I also like that it's one of the only SUV's still built on a truck frame.  Where most SUV's (Explorer, Navigator, Escalade) look like a fat woman on wheels, my lil' truck stayed true to the game.  Yes, yes, y'all.  Oh, I also like that it's got like 5 A/C adapter thingy in it.  I can charge my cell phone, hook up a TV, inflate an air matress, and use one of those big spotlight things at the same time.  Shit, I still have an extra one I could use to cook up some breakfast.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   Because it's black, it almost always looks like it's filthy.  Minor complaint, though.  I still like the color more than any other.    5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   Honestly?  For once, I've got the only car I'll ever want.  Keep your Affiniti, your shit Cadillacs, Lincolns, etc.  I don't ever want a luxury car (or truck) and I don't ever think I'll get a truck bigger than what I'm driving now.  I guess after cursing out assholes in the really nice cars for so long, I wouldn't ever want to be in legion with them.  Besides, in my world, I've had plenty of shitty, shitty, cars and my Xterra is like a luxury vehicle to me...in comparison.         "
"            Whad'up y'all    1. What vehicle do you drive?   2001 black Mazda Protege5 - that's right the Hatchback is IN!   2. How long have you had it?   1.5 months   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   It's priced less than my other car payment(s). and I absolutely LOVE my sunroof...'wave your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care'   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   The CD player skips when I hit a bump in the road. I miss my six-disc, sub-woofered system of my SUV, but let's not reminisce here, BB...*single tear rolls down cheek*   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   red, convertible luxury sports car - phat stereo, suped engine and a massager built into the seats. awe yeah. (I testify that I have never watched 'The Fast and the Furious' nor '2Fast 2Furious' but HAL can fill you in that they are worthwhile cinema fare.)         "
"            Back Again.    1. What vehicle do you drive?  99 Toyota Corolla.  Black.  I really liked it when I got it, now Im sick of it.  But the great part is that I just dont care about it  bring on the hail, door dings, and muddy feet.   2. How long have you had it?  Close to 4.5 years.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?  Keyless entry (great when you have groceries), HOWEVER, I dont like the beep sound it makes.  When I go to lock it or unlock it, I feel like all those around me are asking why Im engaging (or disengaging) a security alarm on a 5 year old crap car.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?  See above.  Plus, the breaks are currently squeaking.  Grrr.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?  No object?  Probably a tricked out Saab.  I know, Im pretty predictable.  And Id go with a color  Black is played out for me.          "
"            I Like the Five and Hope You Will Too  Duf 'Wheels' Fer   1. What vehicle do you drive?  I have a 1999 Subaru Outback (don't hate).  Incidentally, no, I'm not a lesbian.   2. How long have you had it?  Almost one year.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?  It's a three way tie.  I like the stereo (CD changer and sub-woofer - playaz only, y'all), I like the heated wiper blades, and I LOVE the heated seats.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?  My power antenna is broken, and I know it is going to cost $100 bucks to fix it.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?  I would get either a brand new Toyota Prius, or an electric car. I also like vintage automobiles, and would love to have an old MG and an old VW microbus.         "

"            Now I Know Why They Call It a Bronx Cheer  By Duf Fer  I went to the Yankees and Twins games in New York on Tuesday.  I had a wonderful time.  Yankee Stadium is really cool and the fans are off the hook.  I can't tell you how many times people dropped F bombs.  When Hideki Matsui (from Japan) came up to bat, a drunk kid from the Bronx who was sitting right behind me yelled:  'hit the ball you slanty-eyed bastard!'  Of course, best of all, the Twins won.  Now if only the Red Sox would have won...         "

"            New Digs  My new place is great, thanks for asking HAL! I've got plenty of space and it feels really cozy too.  I even have enough room for my never-ending supply of tolietries. Note to anyone who might consider giving me a gift of any kind at any time in the future: Please no lotions, bubble baths, makeup, medicines (except for the alcoholic beverage variety) or nail care supplies. I hate to put conditions on gifts, but I just physically can't take anymore.   My roommates are throwing a Halloween party the weekend prior to Halloween. All Pandylandahz are invited to attend and trash the great new digs. :)         "
"           Speaking of moves, BB, how'z the new place??         "
"           Did a little research... the Jayhawks show is at 6pm (on Saturday) and costs $15.  Can I get a 'done and done.'???  Every once an awhile, I come across a web site that I'm convinced Panda is behind.   urlLink This is one of them .         "
"           Jayhawks?  Saturday?  Sure.         "
"            'No foolin', the Jayhawks are great' and the band's not bad either.  By Duf Fer  I love the Kansas Jayhawks and the band the Jayhawks.  Count me in it to win it.  Saturday night is the ticket; I'll bring the Night Train.         "
"            Duf is Not a Loser  and  PBJ   Duf, once you've tried the relaxation technique, I think you'll agree that it's one of the more powerful relaxation techniques out there and should be utilized by more than just the smug-marrieds. That would be cruel and unusual punishment for us stressed-out singletons. And we all know that stress causes an unhealthy demeanor which in turn can lead to an uptight, crabby, possibly violent society. We wouldn't want to do that to society now, would we?   I'm down with PBJ with the Jayhawks too. I vote for Saturday as well, but could do the other dates if consensus dictates.            "
"            PBJ - 'A Sort of Homecoming'  and  Let's Do Some Math   Hal, that's very kind of you to suggest.  No foolin', the Jayhawks are great, and a super way to celebrate.  I vote for Saturday, but could probably make the other dates work too.    Now, on to an interesting math problem:  I just shredded every single one of my travel expense reports.  There were 81 total.  On average, for each report, I was in NYC for 4 days.  That's 324 days total.  I have worked here for 32 months or approximately 960 very long days.  Therefore, I was in NY roughly every 3 days.  What did that get me?  207,811 frequent flier miles, 119,108 Marriott Rewards Points (I caught on to the whole hotel point thing a little late...plus, I used some with Hal), 8 free upgrades to 1st class, 1 free flight coupon, 1 free hotel night coupon, and 3 free drink coupons.  Now if I could just get a few weeks of vacation to use all this, that would be great.          "
"            Reflections on My Misspent Youth  By Duf 'Doh' Fer  Hal explained the whole uuuzzzzzsssshhhhhhh thing to me.  Man, I feel like I wasted my entire college career.  And all along I thought that when my roommate but a sock on the doorknob, he was folding laundry with his girlfriend and didn't want me to see any of her essentials.    Now I know why college girls always asked me to relax with them and then said I was 'sweet' and 'such a gentelman' when I didn't understand what they were saying.  Man, I'm such a loser.    Planning to try BB's relaxation technique... Duf         "
"            Catching Up   First thing - hats off to DJS... it's not easy to gulp down your pride.  Glad you got a payoff for your efforts.  Secondly, Panda is headed back to Pandyland central (a.k.a. 'The Tundra') and we haven't locked down the celebration?  What is our collective problem?  I propose we incorporate one of the Jayhawks shows at First Avenue (December 19, 20, & 21) into said celebration.  Who's with me?!!?!?  Thirdly, Duf, let's talk.  I have a great multi-media presentation that explains the whole thing.  It incorporates dollar signs, lights, and a cross.  Once we've met it will all be clear.         "
"            I Guess I'm Really Confused  By Duf 'Little Naive' Fer  I'm confused.  I originally thought that uuuuuuhhhhzzzzzzsssshhhhhh stood for, well, you know...'doin' it.'    But then BB said she likes to uuuhhhzzzhhh to relax, and that can't be right, because, well...she's not married.    I mean it's no big deal, but I guess I'm a little confused.    Can someone explain it to me?  Thanks,  Duf         "
"            Uuuuuhhhzzzzzzsssshhhh   Oh, too funny.  I don't know what it is, but seeing someone else use that goofy phrase 'Uuuuuuzzzzzsssshhh' just cracks me up.  It's just slays me to see it used in someone else's blog entry or hearing someone else say it.  I know, I'm weird.  Ever curious where it came from?  I'll tell you.  Whenever Dirty Abbott and I go to see a movie and there's the slightest hint that there's going to be some 'hot romance' I used to mutter under my breath 'Uuuuzzzssshh, uuuzzzsssh' which in my head is the sound of delicious sex.  Of course, we thought it was hilarious, but not all movies had 'sensual scenes' so we had to make do with anything remotely romantic (i.e. a passionate kiss, someone takes off a jacket, etc.)  Pretty soon we were saying 'uuuuzzzzshhh' anytime someone looked at each other.  It was our way of predicting what the people in the movies were  really  thinking.  Yes, I know.  I'm 31 years old, but I act like I'm 12.  Deal with it.         "

"           Before I continue, let me summarize my 'resignation day' from this shitty job:  *ring* [my boss calls, first thing Monday morning]   Me : Hi,  Worst Boss Ever . [This I would say in my dream world.] What's up? [This is what I really said.]  WBE : I'm calling to talk to you about a 'few things.'  Me : OK  WBE : I didn't like how you handled things on Friday.  It's OK that you left early, but I'd like more warning in the future.  Plus, unless it was a medical emergency, according to policy, you are not allowed to use Personal Days as Vacation Days.  Oh, and the client wasn't happy you didn't call her back.  [Side Note: could it be impossible for me to take 4 hours off to visit my sick, dying mother...or to get tests run for a terminal illness...or to fly to Guatemala to save some starving children?  He doesn't know me or my gig.  What a pretentious asshole.]   Me : Well, I apologize if I inconvenienced you.  But to set the record straight, I did get back to the client and answered her question.    WBE : Well, just don't let it happen again.  Me : Sure, whatever.  Hey, I was going to call you later, but now that I have you on the phone, do you have a couple minutes to chat?  WBE : Yes.  Me : I wanted to offer you my resignation.  My last day will be December 3rd.  WBE : [Silence.]  Oh, OK.  And.... scene !  As my coworker Rob said it: 'He attacked you with a squirt gun, and you came right back at him with a bazooka.'  Paybacks are a bitch, friends.  By the way, I was nice enough to go to NYC yesterday to tie up any loose ends.  WBE wasn't there.  Too bad, since I was so ready to tell him he can suck my left tit.   1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.   Finalize a move date. Finalize a New Year's date. (need someone to kiss at midnight, folks.) Finalize a car purchase. Finalize a start date at my new job. Finish the Frank Lloyd Wright cross-stich I've been working on for my mom for Christmas.  Don't hate; I'm crafty.   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.   I agree with Duf, kinda dumb question...  Colleen Shealer (high school friend) Mary Oksas (friend from Holy Name Cathedral choir who had a baby and dropped off the face of the earth) Stoner (now that she doesn't visit PL, I never hear what's happenin'; but did you know she's ENGAGED?)  I can't think of anyone else...I make it a point to stay in touch with the peeps.  It takes effort, and I'm sure I bug people, but someone's gotta make the contact, you know?  From his post below, I'm sure DJS knows what I'm sayin'.   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.   Be more patient.  Sew my own clothes. Keep my mouth shut when appropriate. Cure cancer. Put on makeup without looking like a hooker.   4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).   1) Start a charity that brings orphaned children from 3rd world countries (and eastern Europe and Siberia - where my cousins are from) to the US to connect with families who can't have children, and can't afford to travel and pay the fees to adopt them.  2) Have my own limo driver (it would be my Polish driver Jerry from NY).  Because I'll be very busy spending all my money, he must drive fast without causing harm to other drivers and/or getting a ticket.  3) Give money to my friends who hate their jobs so they can quit and travel around the world with me in my private jet.  4) Buy a different cashmere sweater for every day it is cold.  Cozy  and  stylish!  5) Throw lavish parties for every season for all my friends and family.  And invite U2 to play at each one.   5. List five things you do that help you relax.

"            Hot Amends   Well, I bit the bullet earlier this week.  Some of y'all (Duf, HAL) might remember the falling out that I had with some of my oldest friends over a year and a half ago.  I said some things, they read some things, I wasn't feeling them, they weren't feeling me and it turned into a real big stinky war.  We shut down all lines o' communications and decided 'F it' we're better off not being friends anymore.  On Monday, I decided enough was enough.  I wrote an e-mail to some of my estranged friends and basically apologized for my end of things.  I was stupid, confused, and just wasn't thinking.  I spoke about how much it sucked to have to amend every conversation about my past with 'Well, these guys I used to be friends with...'  It was tough.  I sent the e-mail, not knowing if I'd be scorned, responded to or just plain ignored.  I got a response.  Then another.  Bottom line?  I met up with one of my old best friends last night at Bennigan's.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but he greeted me with a hug and we shot the shit for 4 hours last night, which I'm sure pissed the waitress off.  I'm not saying things are going to be the way they used to, but it's a start.  Quite honestly?  I feel like a weight I've been carrying around for 1.5 years has been lifted.  It's a good feeling.         "

"            School of Rock, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  As faithful readers know, Duf went to the premiere of School of Rock yesterday.  Oh, everyone was there, Jack Black, Lisa Marie Presley, Governor Arnold, everybody.  Okay, that's a lie.  I did see the movie though.  Here's the deal.  I am a Jack Black fan.  He has made some poor movies ('Shallow Hal' and 'Saving Silverman' come to mind), but he has been in some gems too ('Orange County' is a certified Duf platinum, and I also loved him in 'High Fidelity').    JB is a master of physical comedy.  His body control, his numerous facial expressions, his eyebrows - he's got it all.  Like some of the best plus-sized comedians like John Belushi and Chris Farley, one of his best assets is his ability to use his (non-Chippendales) body without shame.  As the rap impresarios Fat Boys sang 'yeah, I'm overweight.'    I liked 'The School of Rock,' but I did not love it.  I laughed out loud on numerous occassions, and I'm glad I went.  It was entertaining in the tradition of the best escapist movies:  a perfect afternoon retreat.  Still, I will be surprised if I remember much about it next week.  The problem with the movie is that beyond Jack Black (and a few Joan Cusack moments), there really is nothing else.  The kids don't stand out.  The other teachers don't stand out.  The parents don't stand out.  The roommate doesn't stand out.  The plot doesn't stand out.  It is all Jack.  Though I can see him carrying a movie most of the way, he needs some help, and he didn't get much here.    When I think of my favorite comedy films, they work because there are so many characters and characatures.  Like Caddyshack where there are just a zillion zany characters.  I would have loved 'The School of Rock' instead of just liking it if the other characters were...well...characters.    Best line (Joan Cusack):  'Okay, I have an update:  all of your children are missing.'    Second best line (Jack Black): 'I'm pretty sure I've touched your kids, and I know they've all touched me.'           "
"            It's a Boy!   Last night my sis-in-law gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  No name yet, which I see as a good call considering there was an emergency c-section involved.  In addition to being in labor for close to 24 hours, shed been induced, then sedated, then operated on.  Id like to see what name I came up with under similar circumstances.    My parents and I brought the new babys siblings to the hospital around 10.  The oldest (a 10 year old girl), was granted the honor of holding the new baby in the rocking chair first.  She was so proud, and I could see she was relieved.  When we were driving to the hospital I told her that her mom was having an operation to have the baby (to explain why we were going to the hospital before the baby was born).  Just like Aunt so-and-so did when she had so-and-so?? she asked.  Yes I told her.  Oh my niece replied, does this mean that the baby cannot be still-born, like they sometimes are when they come out the normal way?  Uggh.  My 8-year-old nephew did not have so much interest in the actual baby so much as interest in the fact that the baby was a boy.  Yeahhhh!! he jumped up and down when his dad told him that mom had had a boy.  I asked him what he was going to teach his little brother and he replied, how to build stuff.  The best reaction came from the now-displaced baby of the family, my 2 year old niece.  I lifted her up to the window and pointed to the newborn on the other side of the glass.  Sweetie, look at your new brother!  Isnt he beautiful?  She in turn pointed to a cartoon decal on the corner of the window (not in the region of the baby) and screamed, ITS TIGGER!!!!!  Denial, apparently, is not beyond toddlers.   After a few minutes of Tigger admiration, a nurse came to the group and said, Big brothers and sisters are allowed to come and see their little brothers now! and the two oldest ran into the nursery room.  Then dad picked up the toddler and brought her into the nursery with him.  I gathered with the grandparents and watched behind the glass as dad and kids got a closer look at the new addition.  Our attention was taken away from the child in the crib as we watched the face of the child in dads arms.  As she looked down (Tigger was now out of sight lines), the unmistakable expression of confusion, leading to realization, and ending in oh, shit passed across the kids face.  And I swear to God I saw I saw her little fist clench.    To prove that she is truly shameless, later on the little one came out from visiting her mom and corralled her grandparents by lifting her shirt as she approached them and pouting I am hurt.  As the swarm moved in asking what was wrong she went into a long story about her older brother giving her an owie.  Shes good.  So all things considered, everyone is happy and healthy.            "
"           Duf, I'm curious to hear what you say about 'School of Rock.'  I think it's one of the funniest flics I've seen in a long time- all that and a feel-good ending to boot.  Hal and BB thought it was 'just ok'.  I have no idea what's wrong with those two.  Another movie y'all should see is  urlLink Shattered Glass .  Hayden Christensen (hottie) plays the real-life Stephen Glass, the young  New Republic  journalist who faked his stories and almost got away with it...until he got busted big-time by Forbes on-line.  Great depiction of a true story - esp for all you writers out there.           "
"            It's Veterans Day  By Duf Fer  I plan to honor our fighting men and women by leaving work in the middle of the day and going to a movie with Mrs. Duf.  I wanted to see 'Mystic River,' but I was out-voted.  We are going to go to 'School of Rock' instead.  I will give a review when I return.  Yours in gratitude to those who died to protect our freedom,  Duf         "
"            Oh, Two Other Things  By Duf Fer  1.  BB:  on the right woman, the low riding pants, even if they lead to a crack or undies show, are all systems 'go.'  One prob:  they are so rarely on the right kind of woman.  2.  Panda:  Once you go PDA, you never go back.  Check it.

"            Hate is Such a Strong Word  By Duf Fer   1.  What food do you like that most people hate?   Okra.  Thank God Im a country boy.  Have any of you ever had it?  Make mine fried please.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Meat:  its murder, yos.  I also cannot stomach the coconut.  I wont eat it.  Period.  Coconut flavor I like, the coconut itself, I cannot abide.  Add artificial vanilla or any syrup besides real maple syrup.  Also, I need real whipped cream, not Cool Whip.  Thanks.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   I would say Brittany Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Julia Roberts.  Let me hasten to add that I dont think they are homely, I just dont get why everyone goes coo coo for cocoa puffs over them.      4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   This is somewhat embarrassing, but I can be honest among my friends, right?  I am really attracted to  urlLink Lili Taylor , and to  urlLink Illeana Douglas .  Dont tease me.  Im just being honest.      5. What popular trend baffles you?   Number one is the trend with the jeans or skirts that are faded in the seat and thigh.  Whats up with that?            "
"            Who needs Lee Jeans when you can have this...      Yes, folks, I saw the one and only Ricky Springfield on Friday.  It felt like I had gone back in time to 1981.  Hal asked that I break it down for you:  * See that picture above?  Yep, that's Rick's 'signature move'.  He plays his guitar  with a dozen roses  (making a spectacular rose petal shower), given to him by a woman in the crowd.  When we were walking in the bar, I wondered what all the flowers were for.  I soon found out.  The women went nuts for this shit.  *  urlLink The typical Rick fan : suburbanite; 3-inch bright pink nails; fluffy yellow-blond hair; late 30's-early 40's; bearer of vinyl Rick Springfield album covers from the 80's (to get signed, I suppose); short; obsessed; screechy.  * One unlucky sucker was (literally) dragged to the show by his overweight girlfriend.  She made him follow her through the jam-packed crowd so she could see better.  Unfortunately for him, she dragged him right in front of a group of 5 short, angry, Rick fans.  'Hey, jackass.  You're too tall to stand here.  Get the f- out of our way!! *push, push*'  They were out for blood.  * Some quick Rick facts: Rick still has a mullet.  So does his band manager.  He wore a nerdy flannel shirt which he took off half-way through the show.  He also wears (on his right hand only) a black leather glove with the fingers cut off.  He drinks red wine throughout the show (heart condition, perhaps?).  He oozes kitschy, cheesy goodness.  * At one point during each of his shows, he pulls some chicks up on stage.  Here he is with some girls during his Branson, MO show (they look very similar to the girls he pulled up in Chicago.  Maybe they're groupies.).  I call this 'the Rick sandwich':     * I didn't know any of the songs except Jessie's Girl...which he didn't play until the very end.  But obviously, I only went for the choice people watching.           "
"            Did you miss me?    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   I like seafood, and though Im not in too much of a minority there, its the only food I can think of that on occasion people will turn their nose up at.  As in ewww how can you EAT that?? when I eat mussels.  Get over it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Eggs (unless they are in chocolate cake), and apparently, Yoplait Whips.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Vin Diesel.  Though I think Im in total agreement with the other Pandys on that.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   This is a tough one.  I cant think of one I guess I have pretty mainstream tastes.      5. What popular trend baffles you?   Cars that are bigger than houses.  They are very popular at the parking garage here at work.  Dont get it.          "
"            Boy I Sure Don't Like Much   By DJ Shovelpants    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   Boy there's probably a veritable assload of foods that I like that most people can't stand, but I'm coming up short here.  I guess I'm going to go with the old Chef Boyardee Ravioli in a can.  For some reason, I find this delicious, yet everyone I know thinks it smells bad and is horrible tasting.  I don't get it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Do you have a half hour?  Here goes:  a. White n' creamy  - I won't eat anything a white and creamy consistency, which includes: sour cream, mayonaisse, cottage cheese, ranch dressing, cream cheese etc.  I don't know why that is, but none of the above foods or condiments sounds good to me.  At all.  b. Fungus  - I will not eat anything resembling a mushroom.  People spend all kinds of money trying to keep athlete's foot at bay, yet people are willing to eat 'shrooms.  Yuck.  I think the thing that creeps me out about fungus is that it's a scary cross between the animal and plant world.  c. Seafood  - Anything out of the water is staying off of my plate.  That includes: tuna (can or otherwise), fish sticks, croppies, crappies, halibut, salmon, shrimp, whatever.  Sorry, but everything in the aquatic world has a real 'dirty water' taste to me.  And shrimp?  Since when does eating maggots or worms from the water sound appetizing?  d. Nuts  - Some people like to gobble up nuts.  Not me.  The only kind I like are peanuts.  Period.  Cashews, walnuts, almonds...ick.  Bad aftertaste.  That enough for now.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Jennifer Garner.  The list is endless, but this horse-face is sticking out like a sore thumb.  I swear, she looks like Melissa Rivers who is easily one of the most disgusting 'personalities' working in the biz today.  What is Jennifer Garner's appeal?  She's very plain, her eyes are too close together, and I think she's one of the shittiest actresses around (besides that black hole of talent Julia Roberts).  Yet...everyone seems to like ol' Jen Garner.  Shit.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   Sheryl Crow.  I don't know if it's her looks or the complete package, but ol' Sherrie does something for me.  Yeah, she's a little bit older and could definitely benefit from a sandwich or two, but I don't know, I dig her vibe.  Her version of Led Zepplin's D'yer Ma'ker is one song of hers that tickles the cockles...of my heart.   5. What popular trend baffles you?   Those stupid ass walkie talkies cell phones.  Isn't the cell phone enough for you?  No, when you've got to talk to someone immediately, just push a button and open your fat mouth.    'Yeah, Jim are you there?  Over.'   'Yeah, Scott.  Go ahead for Jim.'   'Uh, Jim I can't seem to find the plunger and...'   'Oh yeah, Scott.  It's behind the...'   Annoying.  Infinitely annoying.  As if it wasn't bad enough that we have to hear one half of someone's conversation when they're talking on their cell phone, now we have to hear two assholes acting like their driving freight down the highway.  Some dick in my firefighting class had one and was talking to some shitheel IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS!  Nice guy, but I wanted him dead and his walkie-talkie smashed to pieces. ---------- Bass Babe - About the low pants: yeah, definitely trying to hard.  These pigs usually have a tattoo above their crack in close proximity.  'You like my ass?  No?  How about the tattoo instead?'  Sorry ladies.  No.  PB - What happened with Lee Jeans?  Is he out of the picture?          "
"           Friday Five  hey y'all. sorry to have been MIA the last couple of weeks. Between holy-crap-there's-too-much-work-on-my-plate and setting the most-parties-attended-in-one-night world record (shout out to HAL, my accomplice) there's been no time for blogging. but here's a post to satisfy my fellow 'landahz:   1. What food do you like that most people hate?   hmm...I can't think of anything except Yoplait Whips yogurt that I know only HAL hates. (maybe other Pandies do too...dunno)   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Cottage Cheese. bleck. lumpy, curdy grossness. oh and tunafish. fish that comes in a can?? thanks but I prefer the fish to come out of a lake or ocean.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Ben Affleck. I don't get it. his acting is marginal, personality indistinct & looks are mediocre.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   He's not classicly good-looking but I think  urlLink Noah Taylor  is very attractive. I just loved him in 'Shine.'    5. What popular trend baffles you?   women who wear pants so low that they can't sit without becoming a plumber. Is 'the crack' a now attractive body part? Or is it to show off the underwear? I don't get it. Either way, the look screams 'I'm trying too hard to be 'sexy' because I have nothing else to offer.' Is this popular trend attractive to men? thoughts, DJS & Duf?         "
"            Some PB News Nuggets   * The month-long drinking sabbatical I was on was completely overridden by my drinking binge last evening.  I had put my blood, sweat, and tears into planning a great networking/social event at Second City (a legendary comedy club here in Chi) for my grad school alumni, and what did I do to celebrate?  I got plowed with the Dean of the business school.  When he made a speech and asked me to stand up to be recognized for my hard work on the board of directors, I remember the act of standing up felt like an extremely daunting task.  * Just when my addiction to cable had gotten to the point where I actually considered a 12-step program, it was cut off.  Completely.  No more cable, free or paid for.  I guess I'll have to take up needlepoint or something, cuz I'm not quite sure what I'll do with all this additional free time.  * I got suckered into attending a SOLD OUT  urlLink Rick Springfield  show tonight.  I know he's a chachi, but that point is probably moot.  I'll make sure to throw a pair of my chonies up on stage, along with the 40+ women who will likely be in that crowd.  * Famous last words: 'Let's go up to your place so we can cuddle.'  [For those too naive to know, when a guy says he just wants to 'cuddle' (whether he just met you or otherwise), he just wants sex.  Or at least a dry humping session.  I am not one of those who is too naive to not know this.  Neither is my friend T.]  * My life could dramatically change by this time next week.  I will let you know if that happens.  And now...the Friday 5.   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  I really like to dip carrots in peanut butter.  A lot of people give me grossed out looks when I do that.  How is that so different from putting celery in peanut butter?  Could someone please explain?   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  I'm OK with sushi rolls (particularly wimpy California rolls), but I hate all other sushi.  It's funny, because when I'm in NY, everyone always wants to go out for sushi.  When I tell them that's not my cup of tea, I ALWAYS get this same response: 'You don't like sushi?  But you  look  like you would like sushi.'  I  look  like I would like sushi??  What does that even mean?  Is it my hairstyle?  My shoes?  My bra size?  I am dumbfounded.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  Someone must think Britney Spears is good-looking.  Otherwise, she'd stop making her slutty videos and selling her crap music.  Personally, I think she looks like a damn carnie.  Her legs are kind of squat-like, but I suppose her short skirt/high boot outfit combo doesn't help give the illusion of longer legs.  Someone needs to tell her to stop wearing that shit.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  It used to be Bachelor Bob, until I realized he was as big a tool as any other guy out there.  There, I've said it.  Bob's a pig.  But to answer the question, I think  urlLink Sarah Polley  is unbelievably gorgeous.  She has an average-girl look to her, but when she's on-screen, she shines.     5. What popular trend baffles you?  PDAs.  Don't like 'em.  Won't get one.  Don't try to convince me otherwise. (Granted, I also said that about cell phones at one point, and now I'm a total cell phone whore.)          "
"            Better Late Than Never?  Sure.     1. What was your first Halloween costume?   I was either a gay astronaut (the costume was gay, not me) or a cowboy.  I'm not sure which.  I remember my mom saying that she was getting me an astronaut costume and I was all stoked because when you eat, breath, and drink Star Wars (at 5 years old) you're thinking big shiny helmet, cool space boots, the works.  Oh no.  This costume was the fucking  uniform  the astronauts wear, complete with dicky hat.  It sucked.  I looked like a tool.    2. What was your best costume and why?   I think I'm going to have to go with Moses.  Yeah, that's right.  Moses.  I got a big ol' white beard and white long wig, fashioned some maroon robes out of old clothes and carved myself two styofoam stone tablets where I wrote my OWN 10 Commandments.  Typical commandment?  Thou shalt drop thy pants at my bidding.  Thou shall fetch me some ale.  You get the idea.  The best was dancing with these two tablets.  Had I been single at the time, I think ol' Moses would've gotten all kinds of ass.   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?   Oh, for Christ's sake.  Grow up!   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)   That's crazy.  My friends and I used to do the same scarecrow trick thing.  Hilarious.  We'd also hide people around the lawn in various piles of leaves so that it looked like the entire yard was rising from the dead.  The kids didn't like it much, but I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself.    5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!   No time!          "

"            2003 Top Fives   I don't know if I can remember 5 movies that I've seen this past year. Let's test the memory banks...  1. Lost in Translation -- loved it 2. School of Rock -- pretty funny 3. Elf -- pretty funny too 4. Bruce Almighty -- pretty good if expectations are low, but there is one scene that just made me howl with laughter. 5. Runaway Jury -- sucked.  I saw some other ones too but I just don't remember them right now. I, like Duf, saw some films for the first time this past year that were quite good. The Matrix (first one) was a standout.   Albums 1.  John Mayer ,  Heavier Things  -- I just love this boy's style, sound, guitar prowess, lyrics, the whole package. dream job = John's bass playah.... and lovah .... 2.  Sting ,  Sacred Love  -- this is a no-brainer for those that know me. I will like something, if not all, of anything he records. 3.  The Thorns ,  Self-titled  -- love those harmonies! 4.  Train ,  My Private Nation  -- I'm a sucker for well-written, catchy pop music. 5.  Pete Yorn ,  Day I Forgot  -- love this guy's sound, really enjoyed his concert too.  6.  Guster ,  Keep it Together  -- I just picked this up last week and I'm really diggin it. Since it was a late-in-the-year admission, it's gotten less air-play than the above albums.  Ok, memory banks are in fairly good condition...           "

"            My Top Five  By Duf 'Ain't Had No Sitter' Fer  I haven't seen five movies this year.  I saw  28 Days Later  and liked it.  Mrs. Duf and I just saw  House of Sand and Fog  (we both liked the book) and thought it was quite well done.   We also saw  American Wedding , and I know that no matter how hard I try I will never get those 2 hours back.  I saw  Narc  in 2003, so can I count that as my favorite?  I have, however bought a robust number of albums.  I still need to get some stuff that folks have been raving about (Metallica's  St. Anger , Jay-Z's  The Black Album , Yeah Yeah Yeahs  Fever to Tell , The New Pornographers, Dizzee Rascal, Blur's  Think Tank  Drive By Truckers and Bubba Sparxxx), but my current list, from number 5 to number 1 is:   Cat Power  -  You Are Free :  I picked this album up on a recommendation from a Kansas Public Radio show, and it blew me away.  Not uplifting, not hard rocking, but mellow with force.   Outkast  -  Speakerboxx/The Love Below :  When it is right, there has never been anything more right.  When it is not, it is still darn good.  If I tended to listen to either side as a whole, I would rate it higher, but there is something about this two-disc set that prompts me to use my next track button sometimes.  It may just be the nature of the two-disc set.   The Strokes  -  Room on Fire :  The more I listen to it, the more I see it as beautiful in its mathematics.  The whole album is patterns and deviation from patterns.  Brilliant!   The White Stripes  -  Elephant :  It mentions the city of Wichita...no on has done that since Soul Coughing and before that you have to go back to Glen Campbell.  But as for Jack and Meg, two words:  ass-kicking rock.   Radiohead  -  Hail to the Thief :  Okay, I'm so biased that I'm not terribly reliable.  If I admit to being a bit blinded by my love of all things Radiohead, will you listen again to what is still a phenomenally well-structured, well-produced, well-considered and well-executed work of art?

"            Can You Tell I'm Swamped at Work?  By Duf 'Waiting for the code drop' Fer  Since we're all buddies, and you all know me as a man deeply rooted in the masculine and heterosexual tradition, I call tell you all without fear of compromising my standing as a manly man, or my status as just plain... as... well...macho, that I think I have discovered the best author of all time.  Her name is Jane Austen.  I read  Sense and Sensibility  and named my daughter after its heroine.  I am just finishing  Emma , and though patience is required with all her texts, your reward on completion is an ample one.  I have long argued (much to the chagrin of Mrs. Duf) that sex and money are inextricably linked, and nowhere are issues of class and love more prominently aired than in the works of the beguiling Miss Austen.   Emma  is a masterpiece, and it pales in comparison to  Sense and Sensibility .  I have a book to read for book club (remember I also fart a lot and watch copious amounts of football), but right after that I'm going to read  Mansfield Park  or  Pride and Prejudice .  Maybe I will quit my job and become a Jane Austen scholar at Princeton or something.    Yours over the deep end,  Duf         "

"            May Old Acquaintance, Don't Forget the Friday Five   By PB   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   Getting my ass to the Great North.    2. What was your biggest disappointment?    Meeting a great guy right before I left Chicago - but he'll be here on New Year's, folks.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?   A trip to Iceland and/or Turkey and/or Vegas and/or Europe w/ the fam.   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?   Start an exercise routine - not to lose weight, necessarily, but to get stronger.  I feel like weak sauce right now.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   I'm making fondue (it's about time, DJS) for my visitor and then we're meeting the peeps at Lee's Liquor Lounge for a rockin' good time with the 80's cover band, 2 Tickets 2 Paradise. Then I'll kiss someone (on the lips!) at Midnight.  My dream New Year's: that Hal  and  BB show up too, and Monty does the dance of his life to 'Come Sail Away' by Styx.  *sigh*         "
"            End of Year Reflection  by Bass Babe  As 2003 comes to a close (and I have nothing to do at work), I'm reflecting on all the big things 2003 has brought me, in order:  1. Trip to Hawaii. Amazing, must return someday. 2. Anxiety, heartache, paranoia, rage and grief, all courtesy of my lying, cheating theif of an ex-boyfriend 3. Determination to make changes in my life.  I can honestly say that 2003 is not on my list of 'happy & fulfilled' years. I discovered a part of me that I am not proud of in any way. I wanted to be with someone so badly that I lost respect for myself. And this, I deeply regret. But I suppose it is gratifying to know that I can come out of a situation like that and dig myself out of the hole. The experience of it all has definitely left me a changed woman. And change is, in this case, good.   These last few months I've been very focused on changing my path in life and I'm excited for the future. More as it happens, 'landahz...  Happy New Year! Please accept this as my Year End Five. As I was writing, Duf & DJS were busy posting.   Closed Circuit to HAL & PB: Gee...I wish I had the  urlLink Best Boyfriend Ever ...it's nice to know that Best Boyfriends can also express their attraction and lust for other women.          "

Thanks, I knew you'd say yes...  - Applying, making the grade and becoming a certified Fire Fighter. - Finishing my 2nd book. - Reconnecting with friends I thought I'd lost forever. - Bringing our lil' dog Nigel into the family.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?    I had some promising prospects that were interested in possibly representing and/or publishing my book, but they seem to have fallen through.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?    - A successful and fun wedding in April. - Additional weight loss. - Time to work on Book 3. - EMT Certification - A new job opportunity doing something I love. - A kick-ass trip to Maui. - Another good concert roadtrip with Dirty. - A prego DJ Laura Z. (am I asking too much?)   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?    Oh sure.  Once my firefighting training is done, I'm going to be more pro-active about getting my writing in the hands of the right people.  I plan to attend conferences, join critique groups and pound the pavement a bit.    I also want to look tip-top (weight-wise) for my wedding in April.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?    I plan to keep it on the low-key tip.  We'll probably have some friends over, stay off the streets, etc.  I kind of want to be home in case the pager goes off and I need to save the day.  Holidays tend to be high-action days in the firefighting/emt world.  We'll see how this week fares, eh?         "
"            Year End Five  By Duf Fer   1.  What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   We have a very finicky customer division.  Stabilizing the business in that division is my biggest accomplishment this year.   2.  What was your biggest disappointment?   I set as goal to make VP by the end of the year, and I will not do it.  Feh!   3.  What do you hope the new year brings?   Happiness at home.  Continued health.  Weight loss.   4.  Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?   Yes.  Its all about losing weight in 2004.  I want to look good in a wedding Im going to in April.  I also have some writing goals.  I want to edit my play and work on a novel idea following the Stephen King method (5 pages a day).   5.  What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   We always go to a friends house (MJ  I call her the Queen of Pop). She makes a gourmet dinner, and we drink and play games. It is a mellow vibe, but one of my favorite holiday traditions.          "

"            A Quick Reflection   Things I love about Minnesota: walking into a grocery store and using a cart (first time in 5 years, yo); people in my apartment building introducing themselves to me - and inviting me in to hold their baby; it feels like Christmas without the annoying tourists on Michigan Ave; the cutest neighborhoods ever (thanks to 44th & Upton); not worrying about locking my car if I'm dropping something off somewhere (my landlord laughed at me when I first got here because I locked my car each time I walked even 10 feet from it); not getting my mail stolen; seeing my friends again!  Things I hate about Minnesota: the mounds and mounds of snow and ice and the horrible cold (my movers' locks were frozen when they arrived...after it took them 4 hours to start their truck).  Slow drivers.  And the Vikings.         "
"            BB was here and she lies.   Yes, BB was just at my new house, and I received a gorgeously wrapped present from her.  The beauty was astounding.  The wrap was purple with pink polka-dots and it was tied together with a pretty magenta bow.  Almost too pretty to open.  Almost.  I've started my new job and found out quickly that my posts here will definitely be slowed down.  I work in a busy 'cube farm'...not condusive to fooling around.  Fooling around = making personal phone calls, instant messaging, or posting on blogger.  The good news: it looks like I'm going to be very busy.  The bad news: I don't know shit about insurance.  My defense: smile, nod in agreement, and throw out terms like 'HIPPA' and 'Fact-Based Medicine.'         "

Now I usually do the 'gift bag' sort of wrapping, but I thought, 'I'm really going to give it an effort this year and wrap all the gifts with ribbons, bows, the whole nine yards.' Ok, so I wrapped 'em all and the paper and riboon actually highlight my lack of wrapping talent.          "

"            Yesterday?  Yeah...That Was A Good Day   Friends, so often we find ourselves talking about the negative things that happen in our days.  Why is that?  Is it because rotten things happening to our person is more interesting?  Do we seem like a braggart if we talk about our successes or when things go our way?  I have no fucking idea.  But, at the risk of sounding bragadocious (check the spelling on that one, HAL) I want to tell you why yesterday was a good day.   1.  I went to work hungry (we need to grocery shop, y'all) and DJ LZ had picked up a delicious Jamba Juice for me yesterday.  Orange A Peel...there ain't no stopping it.   2.  I sent out 10 (count 'em) 10 query letters to solicit my book.  To this date, I've never sent out that many at once.   3.  I got a X-mas card containing a gift certificate for $30 at Best Buy from CK2.  Thanks!   4.  Shortly after, I got a X-mas card containing a Godiva chocolate bar from Duf Fer.  Thanks!   5.  Duf and I enjoyed a mouthwatering burrito (with no waiting) at Chipotle.   6.  The appraisal guest speaker session I put together was well received and went off without a hitch.   7.  I found out I passed my state certification.  Translation: I'm an official card-carrying firefighter now.   8.  Whilst shopping, I found a video game I was looking for...and cheap!   9.  Got the bulk of my X-mas shopping done.   10.  Saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.   11.   DJ LZ bought me a pint glass (I collect 'em, you know) with a little rabbit on it that says: 'Hey this made me throw up a little.'  Yeah...it's gonna be hard to top yesterday.         "

"            O Come, O Come Emmanuel     1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   Yep.  They go hand-in-hand.  But as soon as the 25th of December passes, bring on the warm weather vacation!   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?   I like mixing it up from year to year (i.e. sometimes being at home, sometimes visiting family, sometimes picking a new destination), but the perfect celebrations always include good food and great company.   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?   My family doesnt have too many Christmas traditions, except that we always go to Mass at some point.  And if were home, we open presents on Christmas Eve (when traveling, we dont bring presents with us).  When Ive been in England for Christmas, we do Christmas crackers (two people pull apart a paper contraption that cracks and a toy prize, a joke, and a paper crown fall out) and wear our paper crowns during Christmas dinner.   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?   I act pretty much the same towards the needy during the holidays as I do the rest of the year.  The major exception is that I throw snowballs and ice chunks this time of the year, whereas in the summer its usually pop cans and other garbage.    5. What one gift would you like for yourself?   A day at the spa.          "
"            1.  Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   To me, cold weather is more essential to the holidays than anything else except family and friends.  Later this week I may go to Florida for work, and it is hard to imagine I will feel a holiday vibe there at all.  I know for those who live in warmer climes, it is fine, but for me, a white Christmas is preferred.   2.  What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?   Family and friends.  Food and fun.  Relaxation.  That is my ideal holiday.  A portable DVD player wouldnt hurt either (just kidding).  I would love a Christmas where my family and Mrs. Dufs family all got together.   3.  Do you do have any holiday traditions?   Every Christmas and every Thanksgiving, I read short stories from a Truman Capote collection that the Modern Library issues.  I also get snockered on Tom and Jerrys and tell people what I really think of them.   4.  Do you do anything to help the needy?   I absolutely refuse to give a cent to the Salvation Army (for political reasons).  I would sooner eat $1000 than give them a penny.  Mrs. Duf and I do most of our charitable giving this time of year.  Our favorite charities are a local humane society, Mother to Mother (a Catholic charities group), the Minnesota Literacy Council and the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.   5.  What one gift would you like for yourself?   A portable DVD player with Bose noise canceling headphones (does that count as two?).          "

Starbucks coffee, Sunday afternoon.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   Like em both, but I only really order online from Amazon.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?   I got an allowance, but I dont really remember it, aside from needing to empty the dishwasher, etc. to get it.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   On Saturday I spent $60 on a top that, in hindsight, I dont really like or need, so Im going to return it.  Thats at the high end of what Ill spend on clothes (exempting shoes, purses, and outerwear, of course), and Im certainly not going to spend it on something I dont like.          "

"            Still Here, Yo.    1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?    Yeah, I do.  I'm a total consumer and I can't go a paycheck without buying myself some shit.  Whether it be a DVD, music, vids, or anything else that I really don't need, I'm a junkie.  Everytime I walk through a store, I'm making a mental list in my head of all the crap I want to buy.  It's a sickness, I'm sure.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?    Well, I just put a bid in for the Johnny Cash autobiography in hardcover.  Does that count?  That was like an hour ago...    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?    This is a tough one for me.  I like the convenience of shopping online, as I can't stand crowds and stupid people walking slowly in front of my.  I also like getting a 'parcel' in the mail, which is another benefit to shopping online.  The only thing that bugs me is that I want my product NOW.  Having to wait is the worst.  Literally, it'll ruin my day if I'm SURE my package will be there and it's not.  Yeah...I know.  I'm goddamn weird.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?    I seem to remember like a $1.00 a week.  But we had to earn it, yo.  Make our beds, keep our rooms tip-top.  I think I saved my money for toys and my brother would spend it right away on candy.  He'd get pissed when I'd buy a Star Wars figure and he'd be ass out.  I wish I could save my money like that now.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    I got a stupid back-massager thing for my chair here at work.  See, I jacked my back on Thursday night and I needed a quick-fix before my big firefighter test yesterday.  It was like $40 and I ended up slamming the remote control in the door.  So, I did what anyone else would do:  After my back felt better,  I returned it and got a full refund.  It was seriously a piece of shit, though.  (Panda: If you aren't locked in for insurance yet, you should let me know.  Our State Farm agent is good quality and he's cheap.)               "
"           Before I answer this Friday 5, I'd like to review one of my answers to our last one...  ** List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.   Finalize a move date.

Why or why not?    I only like to shop if I have a purpose.  Otherwise, I'd rather not browse or window-shop.  If I do that, I only buy shit I don't need.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?    Christmas presents.  But they're a surprise, y'all.    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?    For clothes, I prefer going to the shop in order to touch the fabric and try 'em on.  I usually buy my books and CDs online, though.  Not a lot of risk there.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?    I think my allowance was something like $3.00 a week in grade school.  What could that buy me?  Stickers...I was obsessed with stickers.  But I don't remember getting an allowance in high school.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    Car insurance through Geico.  I think I got majorly screwed, but I didn't have time to shop around.  I forgot how much it costs to own a car.             "

Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   Its a tie.  I hate the wait associated with online shopping; it takes too long to ship things, but I love how it avoids the crows and hassle.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?     Yes.  When I was in high school, my allowance was $100 a month (I had to use it for everything).   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?

One million dollars is a lot of money, but it is not a  life changing  amount of money to me.  Does that make me hopelessly middle class?

Do you invest any? If so, how?  I invest the remainding $542, 500 by putting $50,000  in TinyEs 529 plan (which, with the present amount plus 15 years of growth, should pay for Bennington or Radcliffe or Princeton or Kansas University or any other school she wants to go to) and by allocating the last $492,500 as recommended by my advisor (though I suspect a healthy portion of it would go into residential real estate).

PB, I'm so confused, can you give me details?  HAL went home sick and there is a lot about your blog that baffled me.  BB, How much did you spend, and on what?  Inquiring minds want to know.  HAL, get well soon.         "
"            Images   Okay.  So we'll never have to worry about our pictures going offline again.  I doubled down and paid a whopping $4.50/per month to host any pictures and such that we need for this here site.  In celebration of that, I decided to kick Ruffy's ass out.         "
"            Spice It Up   BB and I attended a party on Saturday night.  It wasn't your regular party.  It was one of those parties where they sell things.  You know those parties where ladies get together and the host gets discounts on merchandise if the attendees buy a certain amount?  The products can range from candles, to lame-o baskets, to cookware, to cosmetics.  This party was kind of like that.  Emphasis on  kind of .  There was a host, and there were things being sold, and there were demonstrations...  of  intimate  items.  The demonstrator first started out with bubble bath and lotions...you know, just to get the crowd loosened up.  Then she brought out the big guns - things that vibrated, shook, lit up, and downright scared the hell out of me.  Bottom line: I dropped 100 bones and it's going to be a  great  Valentine's day this year.         "
"            A Great Relief   Now that Duf has a new toy, we're back on course for 'teambuilding'.  Name the date.         "
"           Duf - you will love Sanibel/Captiva!  (Have you been there before?)  As a kid, we went there (w/ grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins) every Spring Break.  I'm a bit nostalgic for the place.  Recommendations: Go to the Mucky Duck (restaurant/bar) and bring TinyE to the beach to collect sand dollars.         "
"            Well, I Did It  By Duf 'Road Warrior' Fer  I spent much of last year going back and forth on whether I should get a portable DVD player.  Pros:  I travel a lot.  I like movies.  It would give me something to do on the plane.  Cons:  I didn't want to buy one if I wasn't going to travel much (I live in denial and always think my travel pace will lighten).  They are spendy and I kept thinking the price would come down (which it kind of did).  I like to read and thought I would not read as much if I had movies to watch (although I used to be able to play movies on my laptop, and I found sometimes I felt like reading, and sometimes I felt like watching a movie).  Well, next month Mrs. Duf and I are going on vacation with TinyE.  We are going to Sanibel Island, Florida, for a few days of R and R.  What finally put me over the edge is the thought of sitting next to a fidgety toddler during a 3 hour flight to Florida.    So I got one.  I did it today.  It is not the top of the line (it has a small screen), but it played to rave reviews on Amazon, and the price (3 honey bees) was in my range (there are some that are still in the 800 to 1,000 dollar range, and I just could not afford the divorce).  I'm kind of excited for my new toy, and you can all play with it any time.           "
"           Last night I saw (and  heard  - it was scary) Hal rage about 'snow bikers'.  Before seeing her, I considered commuting to work this morning via Roller Blades, but I quickly reconsidered.  Thanks for setting me on the straight-and-narrow, Hal.  Also, I'll make sure to never bike through St. Paul in the snow, as to avoid a hit-and-run with you.         "
"            High Calibur Quality   If you've got the means (speakers and such) at your disposal whilst at work, check out the website for a band called  urlLink The Darkness .  They're like this generation's Spinal Tap.  I caught their video 'I Believe In A Thing Called Love' on VH1 this morning (when they could be bothered to actually play music) and I just about had a stroke with the laughter that ensued.  Dial it up and see it for yourself.  Click on 'Videos' and watch it.  Classic.         "

"            Bringing Up The Rear - It's DJS   At this moment, what is your favorite...    1. ...song?   I don't know if I've got a favorite song, but I've been spinning the new CD by Jet 'Get Born.'  You've probably heard their song 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' on the radio.  If not, give it a listen.  I think they're much more interesting than the (in my opinion) overrated Strokes.  They're dirty, ugly, and they make sweet, sweet music.    2. ...food?   DJ LZ and I discovered 'Axel's Bonfire' a few months back in Woodbury and I'm a huge...HUGE fan of their chicken quesadilla.  I swear, every time I drive by there I want to pop in and inhale one.  They're that friggin' good.  Of course, I'd be remiss not to mention my five-pound friends, the Chipotle chicken burrito.   3. ...tv show?   Pretty simple: 24.  Now, I refuse to watch it during it's normal broadcast, what with the commitment and the commercials and such, but suffice it to say, I've blazed through the first 2 seasons on DVD and I'm anxious for the release of season 3.  As I've mentioned before, I'm also a big fan of 'Insomniac.'  Dave Attel is my hero, yo.    4. ...scent?   My shampoo.  A guy who's in my firefighting class works at Aveda and scored me a big ass bottle of 'Rosemary Mint' shampoo.  I'm sure by the time I reach the bottom of the quart sized bottle I'll be plenty sick of it.   5. ...quote?   This comes from Tony Almeida after being asked by Jack Bauer (in 24) where so and so was:  'He wasn't playing ball, so I had to take him out.'   Speaking of Sean Penn, I'm finally going to see 'Mystic River' on Friday.  If this movie is going to unseat my Lord of the Rings buddies, I want to at least see what it's all about.           "
"            Here goes...    At this moment, what is your favorite...    1. ...song?   I am currently addicted to the latest from  urlLink Beth Orton  Pass in Time: The Definitive Collection .  Its a hybrid of greatest hits and rarities, and shes won me over again (even if most of its not new to me) after the debacle of Daybreaker.  There are two songs (both in the new to me category) that Im obsessed with  Where Do I Begin (a collaboration with the Chemical Brothers), and Dont Wanna Know About Evil.   2. ...food?  On Saturday night I had a great, great meal at a place called Azia.  I got Vietnamese coconut curry with tofu on brown rice.  It was good enough that Im still thinking about it today.   3. ...tv show?   Who are we kidding?  My  urlLink Alias  obsession is rock-solid and well documented [closed circuit to BB: season 2 is at the ready].  That said, the funniest thing you will ever see on television is  urlLink The Office .  Mr. Fur gave me the DVD for Christmas, and its yet another reason I worship the Duf.  Yesterday, The Office won two awards at the Golden Globes (Best Comedy and Best Comedic Actor) and even the acceptance speeches were hilarity.     4. ...scent?    I got a new hand soap that I like, its lavender scented.   5. ...quote?  GAAAH!!!  I just puked in my space helmet., or You guys cant reenter the atmosphere until you develop a cure for AIDS.  Get crackin. Or just about anything else from  urlLink this site .  And aside from all the nonsense above, I saw  urlLink this flick  this weekend, and I'm still depressed.  What a downer.  But that Sean Penn can act.          "

"            At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?   For some reason, Hey Ya by Outkast has made a return to my CD changer.  TinyE loves it, and I think her admiration for it is contagious. I am rocking it non-stop right now.  I also like this version of 'Simple Gifts' that traditional Quaker song by Yo Yo Ma and Alison Krauss.   2. ...food?   The Javanese tofu at Whole Foods.  Deeeelish! I'm also way into  urlLink these wraps .    3. ...tv show?   CBS Sunday Morning:  they just had their 25th Anniversary show, and it amazed me how many episodes Id seen.  I know I come off as nerdy for having that as a favorite (other favorites are 60 Minutes and The Simpsons), but if you ever watch it, you will be amazed by how they put together a phenomenal show every darn week, 52 times a year.    4. ...scent?   Honestly, I have been sick for so long, that I cant really detect any scents.  I dont have a strong sense of smell to begin with, and you add nasal and sinus congestion to the mix, and forget about it.  Past favorites:  puppy dog breath, new car, and napalm in the morning (it smells like victory).    5. ...quote? We have discovered dozens of weapons of mass destruction- related program activity.  President George W. Bush, State of the Union Address.          "
"            At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?   'Something's Missing' by John Mayer   2. ...food?   the chocolate chip raisin cookie bars my friend Jenny had at her party on Sat. night. She brought the leftovers in to work today and they are absoultely delish. I'm enjoying one right now, so it definitely qualifies as the favorite this moment.   3. ...tv show?   Alias. HAL, I'm due for the second season on DVD. I'm excited just thinking about curling up with another 22 episodes back-to-back. (can we say BB needs a date or two?)   4. ...scent?   Aveda oils...mmm...they are so good.   5. ...quote?   'I'm going to do it...I'm going to do it!'  urlLink FEZ --  That '70s Show  I see the preview for the reruns on Fox 29 all the time, and every time they show FEZ dancing and saying this line in his little accent, it cracks me up. So it's my favorite quote at the moment.           "

"            Finally, Some Peace & Quiet Saturday Five     At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?  'Answer' from  urlLink Sarah McLachlan's  most recent album,  Afterglow    2. ...food?  The chocolate chip cookies in my work's cafeteria...right out of the oven.  I can't resist them at least 3 times a week.  My ass is surely paying the price.   3. ...tv show?  The sexiest (and most intriguing) show on TV:  urlLink The L Word , on Showtime.  My co-worker has taped a couple for me and I'm hooked.  Speaking of my coworker, she started a couple weeks after me, and mentioned moving here from L.A. to be closer to her in-laws.  Naturally, I asked her about her husband.  I should have known better - she said she has a 'partner.'   But she's cool, since she's opening my eyes to the world of lesbian love.     4. ...scent?  White Musk by the Body Shop.  Men can't get enough of it.   5. ...quote?   'A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one.'  ~Mae West  Bonus Link:  urlLink This made me crack up .  Especially considering what year it is.

"           Panda,  It was working this morning.  I saw those scary monkeys earlier, so I don't know.  I think we need to invistigate alternate places to host images.  This on again off again shit is for the birds.  Let's get on that.         "
"           DJS, I could be wrong, but I just don't think it's working.         "
"           Figured it out.  It was because I've 'used my daily usage limit' which means a whole bunch of people must've logged on to see Ruffy Rodgers for themselves.  Crap.  I'll e-mail his picture to you all.  That way, you'll get to enjoy it for yourselves.  (Hint: For maximum effectiveness, cut picture out, tape onto monitor and read my post from this morning.  It's sure to make you laugh until you squirt piss into your pants.  That's the DJS guarantee.)         "
"           Shit.  Not sure why that is.  Everything seems to be working okay.  Dammit.  Maybe it'll come back up tomorrow.  Otherwise, I can e-mail it to Panda and see if she's got better luck.  For some reasons, the pictures stay up better when she does it, playa.         "

"            Meet Ruffy   The old codger up above was on the front page of the news paper in that 'Frozen Hell-Hole' also known as Rochester New York.  Yeah...that was the kind of stuff HAL and I had to put up with whilst traveling for bid-ness.  Yeah, it was cold there, but Jesus Christ.  This is front page news?  HAL and I joked that ol' Ruffy Rodgers (his real name, no shit) looked like he was saying: 'Please...make it stop.'  Doesn't it look less like his ears are cold and more like they've been seared off with some sort of hot branding iron?  Word of advice, pal.  Be careful how you show your displeasure with the elements.  Otherwise, your wimpy ass will end up on the front page of the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle.  Or the very least, Pandyland.  Anyway, since I ruined the whole picture thing last time when I removed that creepy monkey, I thought I'd make up for it with a new mascot of sorts: Ol' Ruffy.         "
"            A Fine How Do You Do!/Caught Up in the Stupid/Dealey Rememberances  By Duf 'Left Eye' Fer  This morning, my daughter, TinyE, a child who I carried in utero for 40 weeks (not the 9 months of rumor) and labored 27 hours and 16 minutes to deliver, a child I nursed for 13 months, four days and two feedings, punched me in my left eye with gusto.  It's still watering...  There was a small girl who punch my eye.  I don't know why she punched my eye, perhaps I'll cry.    Last night I watched that new reality show, My Big Fat, Greek, Obnoxious, Fat, Loser Fiance.  It will not hold my interest, but it did for about 23 minutes.  Last week I caught a minute of 'The Apprentice' and saw the Donald fire someone.  That was engaging.  I would watch it again, but there is no way I will remember when it is on next.   For some reason I kept thinking that we all should be on that show.  I would win for sure.  Sorry Landahz', I'm corporate like that.  HAL and I are returning to Dallas and perhaps to Dealey Plaza where apparently there was some assassination or other.  Last time we were there we got milked for a 3 hour tour (a 3 hour tour) and conned out of 5 quid (all we had) by our tour guide.  We both felt lousy, but HAL was the only one with cash (I get no miles when I pay cash, you feel me?).  Anyway, HAL should we go back to give a proper tip?         "

"            To Quote Wil Farrell:   'I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it!'  Now, on to our regularly scheduled program...   1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?    Don't have one.  We probably have the oldest version ever of Lotus Notes here at work, and there's actually not the capability.  But in all honesty, I think they're a bit pretentious.  Plus, I never understood why people put their e-mail addresses in them.  Aren't you already sending the person an e-mail?  Don't get it.   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   I used a weird Chinese proverb: 'Do not use a hatchet to kill a fly on your friend's forehead.'  Don't ask me why.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?   I remember when my little brother slaved over what he wanted on his plates.  He eventually settled on 'MUEGLFN' (Marquette University Eagle Fan.)  What a chach.  I would probably choose MNKYLVR or U24EVAH.   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?   I got a pen for high school graduation with my name on it.  Dumb gift.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?    I'm totally ripping this off from  Moulin Rouge : 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.'         "

Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  Yeah, I did.  It wasn't anything inspirational or even very nice at all.  I think it simply said: 'I never liked you.'  I guess at the time, I used to say that to all of my friends.  They'd say something I didn't like, even in jest, and I always came back with those 4 simple words.  Back then, it was comedy platinum.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  I did have some vanity plates.  Thankfully I got them before Duf got his mitts on them.  Mine were: PSTLWPD, which was short for 'Pistol Whipped' which was what I called my fictitious production company.  I thought they'd look great on my Plymouth Breeze (please kill me now) but sadly they went the way of a passing breeze, which is to say: I don't have 'em any more.  I would like:  FIREGUY VIDS YO POWERUP WNGAME DJSDJLZ BLLSOUT DLISHUS LASTWRD UDNTKNW   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  Not sure if this counts:  When I was 5 years old, I was one of those poor kids that were in those paegants and I ended up somehow winning the top prize, which meant I was forced to ride in parades all year long and give speeches at stupid events.  For my trouble, I won a bunch of crap or what we like to call gifts.  One of the things I got was a bracelet that had my name on the front and it said: 'Junior So-an-So 1978.'  Lame.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?    That DJS hasn't been around Seriously...nowhere to be found I heard the other day He went off on his way Now he's planted in the ground.  (Actually, I probably won't have one.  I've got a real problem with the embalming process and all of the weird decorative things our culture does with dead bodies, so I hope to be melted down exactly as I'm found.

We went to a school out in Woodbury and got to talk with little kindergarteners about firefighters, trucks, etc.  I probably looked like a smiling buffoon because I really, in all seriousness, think little kids are the funniest creatures walking the planet.  They sat 'on their pockets' (a new term for indian-style sitting) and looked up at the other guys and I like we were superheroes.  That alone, has been worth all the work and stuff I've done to become a legit fireman.   Some highlights:   - When asked if they had any questions, 10-12 little hands shot up.  'How hot does in get in those fires?' 'My grandma had surgery on her knee last month.' 'One time my dad was driving and he saw smoke coming from his car.' 'Do you catch bad guys?'   - When brought outside to have a look inside our fire truck:  'I've never been in a fire truck before!'   Yeah?  I said.  What do you think?   'It's good.'   'Aren't we going to drive around and put out fires?' 'I want to climb the ladder.'   (note: the ladder is 75 feet straight up in the air)  As I helped the kids down from the truck, I told them to be careful because it was slippery.  As I led the group of 5 kids back toward the school, I noticed a little hand had grabbed mine.  I looked down and this little girl was holding my hand.  Awww....  I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea: I can't wait to have kids.  Side note: I should be getting some pictures of the event soon.  I'll be sure to share them, yo.         "
"           On my coffee cup this morning:  'High up, where the mountains meet the sky, Starbucks journeys to find the best coffee beans in the world.'  Doubtful.  How about: 'I just got ripped off by $2.76.'  That's what I want to read next on their stupid cups.         "

By Duf 'Alright, alright already' Fer  After repeated days of finding my newspaper in the middle of my mid-shin high snowy lawn, I finally relented and sent a nice holiday greeting (a.k.a. 'tip') to my paper carrier.  Some call it Minnesota nice.  Some call is passive aggression.  Some call it blackmail.  Either way, I am looking forward to finding my paper on my stoop again.

"           Thanks, DJS, for putting up that pic of me and my boyfriend.  Yes, it's true.  I like older men.  Since there was no Friday 5 put up, I went back into their archives to the first FF ever.  Enjoy.   1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)?    Madison, WI.  I was the first born and an apple of my parents' eye.   2. What is your favorite number?   Who cares?   3. Vanilla or chocolate?    Is this a reference to my taste in men?  They are both appealing and I have had fun with chocolate, but usually go with standard vanilla.  Wait, flavors of ice cream?  A mix of both, of course.   4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?    Travel...I'm constantly planning where I'm going to go next.   5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?   Can you believe I still sleep in a tiny twin bed?  It's not that I can't afford a bigger one, and I also have the room, but the twin (w/o box spring) is so damn easy to move, I can't part with it.  And it's the comfiest, not-too-firm, not-too-soft mattress ever.  Waterbed?  What is this, 1972?         "
"            Christ.   Speaking of which, I really want to go and see the new Jesus movie, but it seems I'm in short supply of friends who feel the need to see it.  I mean, sure I know how it ends with everyone's favorite bearded son dangling from the crossbeams, but that doesn't necessarily ruin it, right?  Oh.  Sorry if you didn't realize how everything turned out in the end.  *SPOILERS!*  But seriously, I'm thinking this is going to have to be one of those movies I go and see myself.  Just like when you talk about politics with people, religion has a tendency to cause massive rufflings of feathers and I won't be able to help but talk about some of the stuff I've seen.  It's too bad, really.  I'm usually very interested in where people draw their beliefs and what kind of background brought them to the faith (or non-faith in my case) they currently hold dear.  Why do people have to get so worked up over it?  Believe what you want, how you want, whenever you want.  It's simple.  For Chrissakes...         "

"            Get Ready for Rampant Same Sex Marriages!  By Duf 'It Just Took a Celeb' Fer  I'm sure  urlLink this  will turn the national tide.

"            Something every consumer should know.   Last night I saw Frank Vascellaro (sans Amelia Santaniello) at church.  I'm not much for conspiracy theories, but after reading Duf's earlier post, I see it as undeniable that Pandyland is about to be exposed by an in-depth undercover report.  I have a feeling it has something to do with the seemingly innocent everyday item that is really a death trap lurking in each of our homes (I'll tell you what it is in a later post... stay tuned).  The sad thing is, Frank wasn't even trying to disguise himself (I can't speak to his run-in with Duf).  Enjoy your last peaceful days of anonymity, Pandylanders.         "

"           Quick comment to Duf - it's clear that you don't watch enough reality television if that 'Obnoxious Fiance' show is one of the 'best tragedies ever displayed on television'.  I recommend regular viewings of 'The Bachelor(ette)' and 'The Real World' (emphasis on the Las Vegas season).  Although I didn't see any of 'MBFOF', I don't think anything there tops Trishelle having a three-way in the hot tub (with the other roommates watching) as an act of rebellion directed towards her dad.

"            Ash Wednesday - more than just Dirty Ashes   Today is the day I give up cookies and ice cream. (Also, my mother reminded me - 'No meat today!') And, for 40 days and nights I will try (my hardest) to get to bed by 10pm (weeknights only -  I'm sure the Lord will accept the fact that I need to whoop it up on Friday and Saturday).  Tonight Hal and I plan on going to the Basilica to get our ashes.  I tried to encourage her to go this morning in order to be able to walk around all day with a dirty forehead (and, in turn, be an example to all the pagans), but she wasn't for it.  (In all seriousness, I always laughed at the clowns who did this in Chicago - what's next...a crown of thorns and stigmata on both hands?  Good grief.)  So if I get a little irritated over the next 6 weeks, blame it on lack of sugar.         "
"            Is it Just Me?  By Duf 'the Lone Blogger' Fer  Here's my thing about  urlLink this .  My whole philosophy is that all groups of people who pay for services ought to be able to avail themselves of those services.  So, the money that supports civil services (roads, sewers, and marriages) is paid by all manner of people:  American Indians, Women, the poor and people who are gay and lesbian.  So, if they contribute money that supports those services, they ought to be able to use them.   I don't buy (at all) the argument that allowing our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to marry undermines the sanctity of a union between a man and a woman.  First, it is damn near impossible to further undermine the sanctity of marriage.  You can buy a bride on the internet; you can marry someone you have never met; you can get married while you are intoxicated; you can marry a cousin; you can marry someone so they can stay in the country; you can marry someone so that you can stay in the country; you can get married at the end of a shotgun; you can get married if you are a minor; in some counties, you can marry more than one person.  Also, divorces are through the roof (you can get them for $99) (although the federal government is spending $15 billion to promote marriage, so divorces should go away pretty soon).  Plenty of men and women don't get married at all, they just sleep together (I'm for it) or live together (would advise against it - long story).  So don't give me the sanctity of marriage routine.    Second, if something is sacred, the failure of others to regard it as such should not diminish its sacredness.  It's like arguing that noble Christian churches are undermined by ignoble pagan worship centers that also call themselves churches.  When you are within your church it should hold exactly as much meaning as you assign to it.  The fact that others assign less meaning or regard it differently should not (and in my view therefore does not) matter.  Within my marriage, it matters not to me that other marriages are imperfect, I know that mine is flawless.  If only she would give her toothbrush a good shake before putting it away.  I heard an argument on talk radio (sports radio no less) that the real reason some Republicans oppose gay marriage is that it will open up a big old group of people that corporate America has to insure.  Ah, yes, the old bottom (no pun intended) line rears (no pun intended) its ugly head (no pun intended).  But does anyone think that big corporations will just absorb the costs?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Also, here's a quick flaw.  If you have two people who are of the same sex that live together and that would be married if they could, there is a chance that they both have jobs and within that a high likelihood that at each job they are insured (unless they are like the growing number of working Americans that have jobs but no insurance - but I'm pretty sure all gay and lesbian people are rich).  Anyway, are you with me?  So, here is my theory.  People oppose same sex unions because they don't like to see men kissing men or women kissing women (okay, a lot of people like to see women kissing women, but they need to know that when it's all over, the women will be kissing men again - it needs to have a fun, frolicky nature to it, a porno quality, not like getting married and stuff - that is definitely NO fun).  Anywho, anything that promotes men kissing men is just not going to play in Peoria.  That's my theory.    Last point. I really think Bush (pun intended) could give one shit whether women marry women and men marry men.  I think, like Governor Arnold, he was told to raise a ruckus so he is doing it.  It's good for politics.  If it weren't, he would not care even a little bit.  With that in mind, let's leave the constitution to an expression of how our freedoms apply (as in 'insur[ing] the blessings of our liberty for ourselves and our posterity' and not turn it into a document that curtails freedoms ('every body is free except the gays and well the poor and well immigrants oh, and also...' it's just not Constitutional).  It didn't work for the prohibition of booze (great a parties), and it won't work for the prohibition of the gays (also great at parties).         "
"            Big, Fat, Obnoxious  By Duf 'Big, Fat, Obnoxious' Fer  I watched the big, fat, obnoxious finale of MBFOF (My Big Fat Obnoxious Fianc) last night.  I thought it was one of the best tragedies ever displayed on television.  A family from Colorado (BTW at the barbershop this weekend, one of the topics was:  what's wrong with Colorado?  Witness:  Columbine, Kobe, Jon Benet Ramsey, and now the football scandal) was absolutely exposed as egomaniacal, elitist, and not terribly cohesive.  The family almost fell apart because their daughter (a prize, sure, but not exactly the woman of the year) was going to marry a guy who was obese, and worse, uncouth.  Of course when it was all over and the $500,000 checks were cut, everything was fine.  Literally, her brothers were going to disown her because they did not approve of her choice of a husband.  What a pair of assholes (someday they will make fine upstanding members of the community who just happen to beat the living daylights out of their wives behind closed doors (you can't count on women to make good decisions, sometimes you have to raise your hand) - they will marry quiet girls who will take their beatings quietly because it just wouldn't do to have a private matter aired out in public)!  Here's what they didn't approve of:  the guy was fat, he burped a lot, he told crass jokes and was clumsy.  Deep down though, he was a nice guy.  No one would imagine him to be the type of guy to hit her or turn to drink or even run around.  But it  just wouldn't look good  for their sister to go around with this loser.  Better to cut the sister loose than to say that cad was a brother-in-law.  The substantive, the thing you want to focus on for a lifetime commitment, was completely secondary to the stylistic.  The whole family looked ridiculous, even the daughter.  It all left me asking what is bigger, fatter and more obnoxious, the fianc or the family.  The answer is simple.  I bet you can all guess where I come down.            "
"            Random Rants  By Duf 'New and Improved with Extra Links' Fer  1.  I feel sorry for  urlLink Ralph Nader .  He's going to get creamed, and he is going to look like a traitor in the process.  As a (Big D) Democrat, I have to tell you, the one thing we Dems need this electoral season is unity.  We have to be singular in our focus, and any divisiveness is against the plan.  Our friends across the aisle have done a masterful job of keeping their team together behind one goal (even though there are two very different types of conservatives (social conservatives versus fiscal conservatives) they stay together.  Fight and make deals behind the scenes, but in public, have one party, one platform, one message).  We need to match that togetherness.  My main man Nader is tearing that down.  Ralph is running without a party affiliation.  He had no chance of winning in 2000, and he has even less of a chance now.  I really want to see his issues highlighted (especially universal health care and 100% publicly financed elections), but running for President when you have ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF WINNING is not the way to do it.  It comes off as an exercise in ego.  Personally, I don't think even Ralph can derail the donkey this November, but why try.  Why run the risk of having as part of your resume 'delivered 8 years of Bush'?  So I feel sorry for Ralph and fear that all he is going to do is end up tarnishing the memory of a man whose legacy should be safer cars, OSHA and the EPA.  2.  I saw  urlLink Frank Vascellaro  and  urlLink Amelia Santaniello  at Target in Edina.  I didn't speak.  3.  If you live in MN and you have any free time at all, I beg you:  run (don't walk) run to see  urlLink Hairspray .  I saw it yesterday afternoon, and it is wonderful.  It is racy (double entendre - pun intended), but the cast has so much fun, and the fun is so contagious that you can't help but have a blast.  Also, the music is great.  I must confess, that as one of a very, very, very few African-Americans in the audience, I found it ironic that this play talking about integration in the 60s has not yielded perhaps as much progress as we sometimes think we've made.  For obvious reasons, I know very few people who choose not to spend time with others based on race, but, for some reason, you don't see many events or communities that are truly integrated.  It really stood out at the show.  4.   urlLink Vacation on Friday .  Can't wait.  5.  What ever you do, no matter how desperate you get to save money on goods you buy every day.

"           The Friday Five Obsession (with HAL references) By Duf 'Co-worker of HAL' Fer   When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?   This morning.  I have fluid in my middle ear (like middle earth only not as trendy), and it won't come out.  I say 'huh?' all the time now.  I'm supposed to do this pressure manuever 10 times and hour.  So far, I'm about 28 behind schedule.  Earmaster HAL says 'Duf, don't mess around, go to a specialist.'  I am obsessed with fear that I have an ear infection though.   2. ...went to the dentist?   Oops, I'm a little overdue. I think it was August for a cleaning.  I was told I have a very clean mouth.  My reply?  'Kiss my ass you fucking bitch!  Shit!' Seriously though, I am an obsessive flosser.  And I promise to stop cursing on my blogs starting [whore!] now...   3. ...filled your gas tank?   I think it was just before I left for Columbus, so Monday the 16th.  I am obsessive about filling my tank when it gets to the half tank point.  My friend Jeff Schrag (from McPherson, Kansas) taught me that obsession.   4. ...got enough sleep?   That's easy, August 21st, 2001 (the day before my daughter was born).  I am the worst sleeper ever, so it doesn't matter.  I obsess too much and cannot fall quiet enough to sleep.  Rumor has it HAL is also a poor sleeper.  I heard that she goes to bed around midnight, then tosses and turns until about 5:00 a.m and eventually gives up.  That's what I heard anyway.   5. ...backed up your computer?   This backup computer thing.  How does that work?  It sounds interesting.   You would think that I would be obsessive about backing up my computer because (a) I have lost documents before (ask HAL), and (b) I sometimes put things that are very important to me on my computer (like poems and short stories).

When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?   I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, and my doctor back in Chicago understood that since I went to her for 5 years.  The last time I saw her was in the fall.  I still have to find an understanding doctor here.  That's almost as hard as finding a good hair stylist.   2. ...went to the dentist?   Last summer.  My dentist was the best and gave me good teeth self-esteem.  He could have totally been lying, but he was always commenting on how great and healthy my teeth were.  'Aw, shucks, Dr. Goodman.  I'm sure you say that to all the girls...'   3. ...filled your gas tank?   2 weeks ago.  My Toyota has the best gas mileage.   4. ...got enough sleep?

I think something is wrong with me.   5. ...backed up your computer?   Never...this is something that is always nagging me in the back of my mind.

"            I'm Back...   and I'm not a bit happy about it.  You know you've had a good time on vacation when the whole time you're there you're either thinking how great it would be to  live  there or at least come back every year.  Yep, Vermont was great.  And, as expected, I took lots and lots of pictures.  Y'all will get to see 'em, so just hold tight.   1. Are you superstitious?   Hmmmm...when I was little I had the superstition about stepping on cracks in the sidewalk - you know 'step on a crack and you'll break your mother's back.'  My mom already had back problems, and I did not want to be responsible for making her a paraplegic.  No way.  Now I become superstitious during desperate times...I especially like praying to St. Jude, the patron Saint of Hopeless Cases.  Lost your keys?  Praying to St. Jude will guarantee a safe return.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?   You hear about people who wear certain clothing for an extended period of time.  There was a girl in Chicago (when the Cubs were on a streak) who would wear the same pair of underwear as long as the team was winning.  The interviewer asked her what her co-workers thought of this superstition and she said they didn't care.  I can't imagine this girl had many close friends.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?   I'm with Hal, as far as 'knocking on wood' goes.  I don't like to talk too much about something I do or don't want to happen for fear of the jinx!   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?   Luck, fate - are these the same?  I definitely believe in fate...I believe that everything happens for a reason, but we do have control over our own choices.  I have rituals, but not necessarily to bring luck.  For instance, I always check my door to make sure it's locked before I go to bed.  And I wake up to NPR every single morning.  But I don't think any of these things make me a luckier person.   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?    I once had my palm read.  It's so easy to read into all that shit and believe that what is said during a reading is unique only to you.  It's easy to rationalize and think of specific things the reader  must  be referring to in your life.  My friend got her hand read by the same person and we found out she told her some of the same stuff she told me.  Moral of that story: palm reading and the like is a huge crock.  But I still read my horoscope most days and find some things surprisingly accurate...I'm a Taurus (bull-headed, needs structure, loyal) through and through.         "
"            I think of it like insurance...     1. Are you Superstitious?  Yes.  What good Catholic isnt?  I'm superstitious enough that I don't like to hear other's superstitions, for fear I'll pick it up myself.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?  Have you ever watched someone at bat during a baseball game?  I think its the cause of all OCD.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?  Knocking on wood.  I think its good to be aware that nothing is absolutely certain, and not to take things for granted.   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?  No lucky number, per se, but I do like odd numbers, especially 3.  As far as clothing, I have a lucky t-shirt that I wore to my first real concert (U2).  And since were talking about luck, I should mention that I got those tickets from a tour crew member the day before the show.  I wore the t-shirt again when I didnt have tickets for the Minneapolis (U2) show in 2001  I went to the arena the day of, and got floor tickets from a scalper.  I ended up close enough to Bono to check out his dental work.  But the good news is, I only use the t-shirts power for good.  Never for evil.  And when it comes to rituals, theyre pretty much limited to travel, especially airplanes.  Im far too superstitious to blog about exactly what I do before and during a flight.  Dont want to jinx myself.   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?  Only a little bit  You know how each sign describes a general personality type?  Well, I think Im very much a Leo (my sign) and I know many people with similar feelings about their sign.  However, I dont read my horoscope, and I wouldnt bother with getting a reading.          "
"            There Is Superstitious...  By Duf 'Writings on the Wall' Fer   1.  Are you Superstitious?   Yes, in some ways:  (1) Whenever I drive over railroad tracks, I lift my feet of the floor of the car; (2) If I go through a light too close to when it goes red, I swipe ceiling of my car near the rear view mirror; and (3) I only blog in the nude (sorry about the visual).  No, in one way:  while I think it is fun, I dont really believe it.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?   I once heard of a guy who would only blog in the nude.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?   During the NCAA Men's basketball tournament, I wear my lucky KU hat (which Im starting to question) and I watch all the games in the same place.  I still think we lost last year because I watched the Championship game in Columbus (work related) instead of at home in St. Paul where I watched all the other games.   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?   Sure, a little.  My lucky number is 65. When I was a kid, I needed O  65 to win bingo.  I got it, and I won $100 dollars.  For a 12 year old, $100 is a mighty heap of cash.  Also, without luck, how do you explain the career of Bob Hope?   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?   What a dumb question.  Of course I do.  That's like asking if the earth is flat.  Think of some of the famous astrologers through history.  DaVinci, Benjamin Banneker, Stephen J. Hawkins. Think about the planets and quarks.  Think about string theory and chaos theory.  Think about NASA.

"            Time to check in.   Hiya, all - this post marks one of the first times in the past week or two I've felt good, even healthy, so I'm celebrating with a post.  I had a flu-like thing going on, and I made the mistake of going to the doctor earlier this week.  After 3 hours and many pleasant tests (nothing like a nasal swab to put a smile on your face), the doctor told me she didn't know what I had, but it wasn't strep throat, mono or the flu, but it could be the early signs of a chronic and/or degenerate disease [insert joke here].  Nice.  When I asked for more detail on said diseases, she asked if I had 'internet'.  I guess it's silly to ask the doctor sitting in front of you to discuss your health, what with all the computers around.  So, I go to a few web sites to check out the details.  I've ruled out everything she suggested, but regardless, I'm pretty sure I've only got a few good weeks left in me.  Nothing like WebMD to bring out the hypochondriac in anyone.  A little known fact - 'fatigue' is a symptom for literally everything.  That's the last time I go to a doctor.  I'm all about acupunture, chanting and herbal tea from here on out.  ANYWAY... now that I'm feeling better I can get excited about the trip to London I booked last week (for the first week of March).  Yeah, I know, there are so many places in this world, blah, blah, blah.  But the fact of the matter is, what better place is there to be drunk and disorderly?  I love that I'm not judged there.  Besides, I need to live it up before my unnamed disease takes over and I can't leave my bed, much less the country.         "

"            Hiatus/NERD alert!   Hey guys, long time no see!  Why is that, you ask?  Well, I kind of got internet-spanked.   How so, DJS?   Well, you see, there's this guy that works at another office associated with ours.  For the sake of confusion, we'll call him Moses Oatmeal.  He and I like to stir things up a bit and it helps us get through the slower times here on the J-O-B.  Another guy who we used to work with, basically manages a company website from another office.  On this site, they list the birthdays of people who work for the company(s).  Well, since anyone can type in any birthday, we decided to have some fun.  Moses started it.   February 14: Val Entinesday   I went next.   February 21st: Stan Keebottom   And so on.  Well, the one that got people's attention was this:   December 25th: Christ Jesus Our Lord and Savior   Yeah...I guess the IT guys didn't think that was so funny.  Our IT guy (who is a friend) had me in his office and told me that some other IT clown was up in arms and wanted justice for the atrocities committed on the site.  He went so far as to jump into MY computer and look at some of my 'Favorites' and informed our IT guy that I'm a menace to the internet.  He wanted to bring it to HR.  Yikes.  So, I have since cleaned out my favorites and destroyed any incriminating evidence.  I've warned Moses of the same and we're in hiding until all of this shit blows over.  Hence, the lack of posts and such.  Side note, if you guys want me to post any new pictures, let me know.  Send it to me and I'll upload it to my account and get 'er up there.

"            Phases and Transitions  By Duf 'Proud Papa' Fer  You will all someday know the joys and pains of your children's transitions.  Everyone talks about the first words and the first steps (that is when your life  really  changes).  Few people talk about when your child finally learns how to open the refrigerator (no kidding, TinyE has eaten about 15 clementines in the past 3 days).  Here are two more:  last Saturday, we went to our first swimming class, and it was so much fun watching her have so much fun.  She was easily the least obedient kid in the class.  We are very proud.  Last week, we got word that TinyE is moving up to the next class in her montessori.  She will stay there until she is four (basically until kindergarten).  So, she is growing up right before our eyes as they say.   Ah...tranistions...         "
"            It was Square and Iridescent Like a Pearl  By Duf 'Masher!' Fer  What tipped me off that I was in a trance is that she crossed her arms and then scowled at me.  Yesterday I was invited to make a presentation during an officer's call.  I was in the room with our Comptroller; we'll call her CD.  Now, CD is really nice, and she is the quietest person I have ever met.  Last year, she had to reprimand me for consistently exceeding my travel budget, and it was high comedy:  (high squeaky voice) 'um Duf, Bossman wanted me to talk to you about your travel...'  CD is demure and mouselike except that once a month or so she gets in a screaming match with her husband.  HAL and I think there are dark secrets under the surface.  Dark secrets. Dark. Secrets.  Anyway, CD is also, in my eyes, the protypical soccer mom.  She lives in Woodbury, and I imagine her existence to be well-ordered on the surface.  Her hair is never in disarray, and she has a well-washed SUV.  There's two danger signs right there.  So, she was in this meeting yesterday, and at some point I started to stare off into the distance (it is something that I tend to do since returning from Operation Desert Storm).  Then, I realized that within my gaze (I had been focused on a point a thousand miles away, you understand) was CD's sweater button, the one that rested right in between her small but ambitious breasts.  What called me out of my reverie was when she crossed her arms and then scowled at me.   I swear I was not staring at her chest on purpose.  Still, in the words of Radiohead 'I'm a creep.'

"            Road Trip! or NDO NE1 (a.k.a. 'Indio Anyone')?  By Duf 'May Day, Mayday' Fer  Pandyland'z DJS publishes our company's newsletter, and it is a work of art.  Each issue features an interview with an employee, and it is always the same questions.  It's like a Proust Questionnaire for our company.  Anyway, one of the questions is something like:  If you could see a concert by any performer or band, dead or alive, who would it be?  I always go back and forth on the answer.  I sometimes go the Bob Marley route.  Sometimes I think I would like to have seen Vladimir Horowitz in concert.  Led Zeppelin comes to mind.  A Tupac and Biggie double billing is not without its charm.  But when I think about it, the two bands that top my list are now playing in the same place on the same fucking night (no, it's not Kraftwerk, although I remember an entire summer spent listening to 'Computer World').  I have seen one of them (in KC opening for Love and Rockets and it changed my life) but I have not seen the other and boy do I want to see them.

"            Back in the MN Five  By Duf 'It Was Just a Breast' Fer   What's the most daring thing you've ever done?   Its a really long story, but while I lived in D.C., I watched a man get beaten until he was comatose.  It happened in the middle of a pick-up basketball game that I was playing in with a group of strangers.  The ambulance came and so did the police.  It was clear that everyone planned to say nothing, but I talked to the police in front of everyone and gave the best description I could.  I hoped that they would call me to a lineup or to trial, but they never did.  Still, I was so scared that I walked off without my roommates basketball.      What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of ?   This is super lame, but it is my true answer:  I would like to get a motorcycle and ride it all over the place (maybe even open it up to see what it would do).    On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)   Its low now.  I would say a 3 or a 4.  I have people counting on me, and I cant really live my life without considering that.  Having said that, I really believe that some of the things we do that seem the riskiest are really (in retrospect) not so risky at all.  I am a big one for trying to minimize risk, but when all is said and done, if you want to cut, measure twice and then, f it, cut.  Last, I dont really desire things that are really risky.  I have dreams that I want to pursue, but I am fortunate and have ways to pursue them without much risk.     What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?    I wonder if some of the biggest risks we take arent related to love.  About five years ago now, my girlfriend of 7 plus years asked for a separation.  I moved out of a duplex I co-owned with her and another couple and rented a room in a house in St. Paul (I even lived with a smoker, no lie).  As I look back on it, it was a trial separation.  I was going through a really rough time in my life.  I was transitioning out (or being transitioned out  depending on how you look at it) of the law profession and living a fairly reclusive existence.   There was this part of me that felt the easiest thing to do would have been to go back and try to make it work.  I hold no illusions about whether I would have been able to do that  it takes two to make things go right and I probably would not have been welcomed back anyway  but in the middle of a time when I wanted to go home more than anything else, I didnt.  As a result of enduring the darkness (with loads of help, natch), I met my future wife.  As a result of meeting my future wife, I have the true love of my life, my daughter.  I would have endured many more times the risk and heartache if I had any idea how it would all turn out.   ... and what's the worst?   Here again, the answer goes back to a love story.  I once explored a relationship with a dear, dear friend.  In spite of both of our efforts, the relationship did not pan out, and although the friendship is still there, it is changed, and the change has not always been for the best.  Worse, we cant even look back on it and say well at least we got to answer that question that (heterosexual) friends (of opposite gender) sometimes wonder about each other.            "
"            It Can Stop Snowing Already Friday Five    1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?  Cancelling my wedding a month before the big day.  I think there are a lot of girls out there that would have just gone along with it.   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  Ever since I cancelled my wedding (which, in turn, cancelled my honeymoon trip around the world) I've wanted to volunteer either in Africa (specifically in Tanzania - in a village at the foot of Kilimanjaro) or India (in Dharmsala).  Even at the time I told my mom I wanted to do this, she did not approve.  It's not that she didn't want me to help people, she's just a worrier.  I'd like to try a more non-corporate/creative kind of job...rock star, artist, fashion designer, whatever.  But I have a feeling those that are close to me would wonder why I'm not being more practical.   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  7 - perhaps I sometimes make decisions in haste, but I try to never look back.   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  I've lived in some amazing cities - London/Chicago/practically New York - and am thankful for these experiences.  Travelling in general has opened my eyes to a lot of different ideas and people.   5. ... and what's the worst?  I tried some weird-looking food on the street in Thailand and got a severe case of the trots.  Sorry...TMI.         "

"            This Will Be It...I Swear   Now, I'm no spokesperson for the Catholic church (the Pope would probably be appalled by a lot of things I've done in my life), but I do know a good parish and a bad parish when I see (or read about, in this case) one.  Unfortunately for you and your  fianc?, DJS, you stumbled upon a bad parish.  Regrettably, it's the bad/extreme parishes, priests, bishops, etc that we hear about on the news and from disgruntled ex-Catholics.  And all of these episodes, for most people who hear about them, give the entire church a bad rap.  I'm not saying the Catholic church is perfect.  Not even close.  But it's parishes like the one you experienced that are making people leave the faith.  I definitely know more people who have abandoned Catholicism than have embraced it, and for that I am saddened.  For me, Catholicism should be synonymous with acceptance and embracing of all types of people, forgiveness, holy traditions, the belief in only one God...all the basic Christian ideologies.  Instead, what we hear about are condemnations, the rules associated with 'this is right/this is wrong', corruption, pedophilia, etc, etc.  I went to Catholic grade school, college, and grad school.  I have met some amazing people (priests as well as lay people) who embody all things good about the church.  I just wish more people had the positive experiences with the church like I have.  I also think my parents had a lot to do with that.  DJS, I do not categorize you with my ex - the only way I could do that would be if I thought DJ LZ really cared about the Catholic faith.  Like Duf mentioned before, we all are fundamentally good people who want good things for others.  Whether or not you go to a building every Sunday for an hour doesn't change that.         "
"            Just To Clear Some Stuff Up  By DJ 'Hey, hey now' Shovelpants  First off, I don't want any of y'all, Christians or otherwise, to think I look down my nose at you and the choices you've made spiritually.  Religion, like politics, is one of those walking-on-eggshell topics that you can really piss someone off or even alienate them with an opposing point of view.  Personally, I like to talk about where people are coming from and why they believe what they believe.  When everyone can agree to just talk and not judge, some pretty interesting dialogue can occur.  So yeah.  I don't hate anyone for their beliefs nor do I judge anyone for following the path they've chosen.  One of my good friends from work here is definitely on the 'God Squad' full time and he and I were able to talk about where we're coming from.  He 'gave his life back to Christ' as he says 3.5 years ago and I can totally respect that.  If it works for you and it makes you a stronger person (which in his case, he claims it does) more power to you.  I admitted to him that I thought he'd cancel the friendship if he knew that I wasn't really a bona fide Christian anymore.  He thought I was crazy.  I'm agnostic.  During high school, I was pretty sure I was athiest, but I know better, now.  I've basically been a non-believer to a 'I-don't-know-what-to-believe' kind of guy since 7th grade.  Crazy, eh?  Like I said to the mentor couple we met with, I think understanding a higher power is not something we as puny self-important little humans can comprehend.  Christ, we can barely drive a remote control car on Mars and we're supposed to understand something as big as a higher power?  Some people say the good book lays it all out...well, if that works for you:  Sure, friends.  I didn't mean to say NOTHING good came out of our Jesus-filled weekend.  There were some high parts, interrupted constantly by the lows.  DJ LZ and I got to talk about stuff that hadn't occurred to us and we got to see that we're alike in a lot of regards and we really do compliment each other in different ways.   The Bad List  (truncated out of respect)  - Having the priest tell everyone that any church 'worth its pulpit' wouldn't perform same-sex marriages. - Being told that if you don't have kids, the Catholic church won't marry you. - Having the most un-sexy couple in the world explain how to have sex.  'Measure the temperature, and check the muccus for constistency...'  Yeah.  Really put us in the mood. - Being told that if you're in a mixed-religion marriage, that you're asking your Catholic counterpart to SIN if you don't allow him/her to go to mass every Sunday. - Listening to some financial guy tell you that you MUST give at least 20% of your earnings to the church. - Having to hear that the marriage isn't about the couple.  It's about getting closer to God. - Getting the speech: 'If you don't pray together, your marriage is doomed to fail.' - Having to explain to our 'mentor couple' why I'm not a Christian or a Catholic anymore.  As for the church and why we're getting married there...  Personally, I feel the whole wedding thing is basically a formality.  The guy up front all dressed up in robes, people kneeling, squatting, doing dance moves with their hands.  Technically, I'm pretty sure you're married when you fill out the marriage license.  Have a witness sign it and you're good to go.  The church thing is a means to an end for me at this point.  I know that no matter what, I want to marry this woman.  Maybe this lumps me in with PB's estranged ex-fiance, but I don't care if Charlie Manson has to marry us or I've got to jump out of a plane to do it.  I just want to marry her.  If that means I need to bite my tongue and go through rituals that really don't mean much to me other than making me feel the tiniest bit like a hypocrite, then so be it.  That's not to say I don't understand how important and what a huge committment getting married is.  It's not something I'm going to take lightly.  Having done this once before, I can see where things fell apart the first time and I know that this time, things are different.  Final chapter, so to speak.  So, all in all, the weekend was an eye-opener to both DJ LZ and me.  She's decided that our little DJ's won't be baptized Catholic and that after the wedding, we'll have nothing to do with that church.  I'm all for it.  I was just happy that she got to see the church's true colors without any outside interference on my part.  'I've been a blind Catholic,' she said at the end of day one.  'Tomorrow is going to suck.'  That's my girl.         "

"            DJS and Panda Are My Heroes  By Duf 'Not in an idolatry way' Fer  Best...blogs...evah!  When I was in college, I was kind of sort of exploring this idea of dating a girl who was Jewish.  She was and is a very close friend, so I naturally thought about what it would be like to be her boy toy...er...boyfriend.  Okay both!  Geez.  Anyway, as part of my ruminations, I wondered what I would do if things got serious.    She was Jewish (did I mention that?).  I was not.  I knew her faith was important to her.  I knew that she would much prefer (if not require) a husband that could celebrate faith traditions with her.  During most of my college years I was a practicing Catholic.  So, I was looking at abandoning my faith to pursue a life with a true friend (a soulmate acutally) and someone I thought I could build a life with.  In the end, I did not pursue the relationship, but not for that reason (another blog for another day).  A few years later, I stopped being a Catholic right after a mass at the St. Paul Cathedral (another blog for another day).  I was free to be anything, including Jewish.  When I met Mrs. Duf, she had four cats (she still does).  I wondered what would happen if I was allergic to cats.  I'm not, so I will never know.  She married a vegetarian, but one who does not care if she eats veal everyday.  She might wonder what would have happened if I did care (I'll ask her).  The long and the short of it is...dear 'landahz.  You may reach a point where you have to balance.  If you love someone and they love you, but they don't love your traditions or your God, then you have a choice to make.  For me...now...if I fell in love with someone who was a devout _____________, and I was not a devout __________, but I loved her, and she loved me...I would try to make it work. I would go to _________ services and try to raise my children in __________ traditions.  It might work for me, because my only strong view on religion is that we should respect all sincere religious beliefs.  Those who walk a spiritual path that feeds their soul are lucky.  Even if that path does not have a deity at its center.    Still, my approach would only work if I had  some  regard for those traditions.  So, for the Judeo-Christian tenets and for the Ahimsa based belief systems I would be fine.  But for those religions that deviated from that, I might struggle (I say might because there is a lot about religion I don't know).    My view is that we are all basically Christians.  We don't value lying, stealing, killing or coveting, etc.  We might not want to go to Ash Wednesday services, but...at the basic level, most reasonable people are in the same place.   So here is my point.  The second most difficult thing I have ever done is be married (and I've only been married for 3.5 years).  The most difficult thing I have ever done is co-parent (and I've only been doing that for 2.5 years).  What matters most (in both arenas) is love.  What matters second is accord on the essential things.  What is essential is up to each person.  If religion is, then it is best to know that it is.  If it isn't, then it is best to know what is.  What matters third?  Compromise.           "
"            For What It's Worth...   ...before I cancelled my wedding, I went through 2 (I guess you could call them) 'counseling' sessions.  One kind of wigged me out (the one with the over-the-top priest who was going to marry us), and the other was with a married couple from my parish (if you haven't already guessed, I'm of the Catholic tradition.  DJS, don't hate.)  The priest meeting didn't really affect me too much.  The whole time I was like 'C'mon, man.  What the heck do you  really  know about being married?'  But I listened, since I know he had talked to many couples before us, and probably, as an outsider looking in, could give us a different perspective.  Plus, he agreed to do part of our mass in Latin (which is very out-of-the-ordinary and unusual in a cool way since he was only 26 years old), so I tried to give him a bit of our attention for that.  What I thought was really valuable, though, was the meeting with the married couple.  Sure, we had to take a lame multiple choice test with No. 2 pencils and all, but then we had the opportunity to discuss our individual answers and whether or not they matched up (very revelatory, btw.)  The couple pretty much told us straight up that their own marriage had been difficult...(obviously, every marriage is).  It was no walk in the park, but, in the end, they had a spirituality that connected them.  They asked tough questions (not just of the 'God' variety) that I think, ultimately led me to ending it all. Please don't assume we never discussed serious topics in the 2 years we were together before this, but it did bring to light some underlying issues even the strongest couples may not think about.  I believe for most couples, if they share a faith, it's just another thing they have in common.  The more you have in common with someone, the more you're likely to get along.  I don't think being of the same church, religion, culture, hair color, hometown, food tastes, etc, necessarily makes 2 people a  better  couple, but it does give them yet another thing they can relate to.  They can understand where the person is coming from when one of them, let's say, insists on saying grace at dinner.  They don't think it's weird when, at Christmas time, you want to put out a manger under the tree and tell your kids about the Baby Jesus.  They can gag together if cranberry sauce is served at Thanksgiving and they both hate it.  These things may not make or break a relationship, but they can definitely bring a couple closer together.  I know my ex-fiance was marrying me in my church because I wanted him to (he could have cared less if we got married on a beach in Guam).  Looking back, that should have been the big tip-off.  In the future, I wouldn't want anyone to just 'go along' with something that serious (to me) unless they felt as strongly about it as I did.  In my experiences, doing something solely to please someone else always leads to resentment.         "
"            Couples Counseling  By Duf 'Dr. Phil' Fer  DJS...when Mrs. Duf and I were preparing to take the walk, we met with one of the ministers at  urlLink my church  (for those of you who don't know, I am  urlLink Unitarian Universalist ), and she interviewed us about our readiness for matrimonial bliss.  It was very low key, and Mrs. Duf dreaded it like a coming famine.  Mrs. Duf is the introvert of all time, and she literally cringed at questions like:  'why do you love duf?'    For some reason, I have a consitution that kind of likes retreats and couples counseling and all that stuff.  I think it is insightful and challenging and all that stuff.  Having said all that, I'm not sure I would like one that was focused on a faith that was not of my choosing.  DJS, I'm dying for details, so let's burrito soon.          "
"            Friday on Tuesday   by DJ 'Even Tardier' Shovelpants   1. What is your favorite time of year?   Fall.  Gotta be.  Even though it's the shortest season of the year.  That frost and shit that sneaks in around early November?  That's that S.O.B. winter trying to ruin the dry and moody crispness that is fall.    2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   I'm a sweatshirt and jeans kind of guy.  So, I did seasons where I can wear that and only that when I'm out and about.  Plus, my birthday and Halloween are tossed in for good measure.  If October isn't the coolest month around, then I don't know what is.  There.  I've said it.    3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Christmas time.  Humbug!  While I like being with the family and such, it also ends up being the biggest stress-pool ever for me.  Don't get me wrong, I like giving gifts to people, but I just hate BUYING the gifts for people.  I second-guess myself to death and I hate fighting the throngs of idiots out at the malls and the stupid drivers and the snow.  Ugh...what's with the snow?  So, yeah.  F Christmas.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   Do a little dance.  Make a little love.  Get down tonight.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I like being at a cabin.  I love tearing through the woods one minute and then skimming across a lake the next.  That's fun for me and one of the reasons I'd have a hard time ever leaving Minnesota again.  The northern part of our great state is worth all the B.S. we put up with down here.  Also, I like to grill out on the patio with some friends and enjoy a nice refreshing bottle of Miller High Life.  Ah...let the good times roll.         "
"            It Was Worse Than I Thought   Hello Kiddies.  That Catholic Pre-Cana retreat thing I went to over the weekend?  Much, much worse than I thought.  So much so, that DJ LZ is ready to shed her Catholic upbringing like a pair of soiled pants.  Makes me wish we would've had the 'talk' about religion a few months, hell...even a year ago.  Now, we're getting married in a Catholic church and neither of us are in the Catholic state o' mind.  You know?  She's ready to jump ship and become Lutheran (or something) and I've let my membership lapse since sixth grade (I never got confirmed, yo.)  Anyway.  I won't sully the site with what I encountered, but let's just say that I feel good about my decision to not fall prey to the pitfalls of organized religion.  Sure I'm getting married in a church, but that's the last of it...         "
"            Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, All you Think about is Sports  By Duf 'Channel Surfing' Fer  So, my beloved Jayhawks lost to a Ramblin' (and hackin') Wreck.  They will not make a third consecutive Final Four.  Other schools have all the luck.  Why don't my teams win all the time?  There is no God.  Also, f*&^ Georgia Tech and all they stand for.  The South will NOT rise again.  I would rain curses on Atlanta, but a certain hot chick I know is fixin' to move there, so I will hold of on my plague of frogs...  The University of Minnesota Men's Hockey team will not win a third consecutive national championship.  God has forsaken us.  I rain curses on the city of Duluth (but somehow I hope they win it all.  It's weird).  But,  the Gopher women are NCAA Division I hockey national champions , and, thank God, there was no rioting in Dinkytown (the students either feel blah about women's sports, or they are finally understanding that a sports victory is not a cause to burn and loot).    Also, kudos to the Gopher Women's Basketball team (and Lindsay Whalen who I totally have a crush on, totally) for making it to the elite eight with impressive wins over UCLA, Kansas State (there IS a God) and Boston College.  Closed circuit to Duke:  watch your back.  Also, you suck.     The lesson here is that Chicks Rule!   One a final note:  I rode my new bike on Saturday for about 40 minutes.  I am in horrible, horrible shape.  My heart was pounding on me like a Georgia Tech forward.  Midway through my ride, it started to rain.  I was drenched.  Then the wind picked up, and chilled me to my very bones.  My very bones.  But, it was a little slice of heaven to be back in the saddle after the heartbreaking loss (cursed thieves, I smite thee) of my beloved bicycles last year.          "
"            Friday on Monday  by Bass 'Tardy' Babe   1. What is your favorite time of year?   Summer. Without a doubt. No question. No f-f-f-foooolin.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   I like it hot, hot, hot. What can I say...I'm a hot chic.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Winter. Since it's been over ten years that I lived in a home with a sledding hill in my backyard. I grew up in house that was next to a golf course. (no kidding, Duf!) There was a large hill leading into a tunnel that went under the street that was in my backyard. Hours of sledding fun. and since I always tell myself that I will go snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing in the winter and I never do, leads me to believe that I'm just not that crazy about Old Man Winter. I'm breaking up with him next week.    4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   This year, I plan on packing up everything I own, pack it real tight in my little car and driving for 20 hours. Nothing sez 'Celebration' than moving.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I'm with the gals on this one, boating on a lake. simply the best. I also enjoy exercising outside. Running when I'm feeling fit, biking at a leisure pace, and walking around the neighborhood. Another top runner is having drinks on a patio bar on a warm summer evening at twilight.          "

"            Here we go...    1. What is your favorite time of year?  I have an appreciation for all the seasons.  But I typically like the first part of each one.  For instance, I look forward to the leaves changing and the first snowfall, but after awhile I get sick of the same-old and Im waiting for the next change.  This is why I couldnt live in California.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   Lets just consider this the Friday Four.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Um the end of each season.  Maybe the Friday Three?   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   Friday Two?   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I love, love, love being lakeside on a beautiful summer day.  Like the Duf, I also enjoy swinging a golf club.  And I love bundling up and taking a walk at night, right after a big snowfall (as long as its not -20).  Nothing like the sound of crunching snow under the feet.         "
"            My Five    1. What is your favorite time of year?   Christmas time.  I absolutely love giving people presents.  I like receiving them too, but that's not what I look forward to all year.  I love the smell of Christmas trees and this past year I got to set up my fake silver/aluminum tree from the 1950's (it was my nana's - no real aroma except a little mustiness).  Plus, Christmas means a couple days off, which is always welcome.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?    I'm confused.  I think I already answered that.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?    The dead of winter sucks because you can't go outside for even 5 minutes, and all I want to do is sleep and eat cake and cookies (yes, cake and cookies...in winter I have an unbelievable craving for both).  Dead of summer is the worst too.  Not only do I hate being sweaty, but at work we can't wear capris or shoes with open toes, so I'm not looking forward to July.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?    In spring I usually get my shorts, sandals, and T's out for easy access. And I love the first day I can open all the windows in my house.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?    To go boating.  When you're in a boat, it truly feels like summer (and without the sweat and ickiness because you can go swimming, and there's the wind factor).  Last summer I dated a guy a few times in order to have access to his speed boat.  That's how much I like being on the water with the wind in my face...I didn't even like the guy.         "
"            A Five From the Past  By Duf 'Here's How I Felt in 2002' Fer  Our friends at FridayFive.org had all week to come up with five easy questions, and they come up with bubkus, nada, zero, zilch.  So, I went back to the week of March 22, 2002, and this is what they were asking:   1. What is your favorite time of year?   No question about it:  fall.  I love the change of colors, the return of college football, the crisp, cool nights, and the hint of winter in the air.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   Oh, I couldn't really say...   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Summer. Because it's too darn hot.  I don't like to be hot.  I like to be cool.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   I have been known to go to a solstice celebration or two with some of my pagan friends.  Who's askin'?   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   Have sex.  No, I kid...I kid.  It's watch people have sex.  Again, with the kidding.  Actually, it's film people...no, really, it's play golf.  I also like to ride bicycles.  But if I had to pick one thing, I would pick play golf.            "

"            Damn It   Well, I can thank HAL for totally sucking up my evening last night.  She let me view her copy of  The Office  (on BBC DVD) and I watched every single morsel in one sitting.  Everything.  I'm talking about the documentary, the deleted scenes, everything.  I guess that makes me a 'fat git nerd' who watches these types of things 'with the shades drawn on a sunny day.'  Oh boy.  In a word: brilliant, actually.  I couldn't get enough of this show and like PB & BB before me, I was disappointed that there weren't six more episodes ready for my immediate viewing.  Six shows in a series?  What kind of rubbish is that?  Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect with this show.  I thought it was going to be extra-dry Brit humour (notice the extra 'u' in humour) with a dash of skullduggery.  I think I initially judged this DVD set by it's cover, with the very stern-looking twat on the front who looks as though he's sizing you (or anyone else looking at the product) up.  Imagine my surprise when Ricky Gervais turned out to be nothing like that.  While I liked the movie 'Office Space' this show beats the living crap out of it.  Excellent stuff.  Add one more show to the pile of shows that are the exception to the rule.  I'll be buying this and Series 2 in no time.   Favorite bits:  -  'Get the guitar.'  -  'That's good.  I'll give her an 'A.'  -  'Biting...biting.'  -  'Why're you in so early?  Did you shit the bed again?'  -  'Who all has seen this picture?  Joan, you don't even have a computer...'   How sad is it that there are little parts of Tim that I can totally relate to?         "
"            A Few More Details   Before I forget, I wanted to add a few more gems to what Duf mentioned below.  I'm not going to lie to you, the party was a huge success, but with each success comes some mishaps.  Take for instance, the poor  urlLink Big Unit  (who from now on will be referred to as 'The BU').  He got asked by a (heterosexual) couple to go home with them.  I never thought I'd date a guy that fits the 'swinger' stereotype.  Luckily, he had no idea what they were talking about and didn't take them up on their offer.  (He told me later that after he turned them down they left, but then 5 minutes later they came back inside and asked him again...so either this really happened, it was deja vu, or the appletini I made him was too strong.  Regardless, they propositioned him at least once.)  Then there was BB's roommate who stumbled across some cheatin'-style hanky-panky in the coat room.  They had politely put all the coats outside the room, but unfortunately for BB, her purse remained inside.  Her roommate entered the room and survived to tell the story.  I'm not going to bother you with the details.  Use your imaginations, sickos.  I also met an interesting couple who were not convinced I could make them a good cocktail.  The leather pants clad husband grabbed the shaker (from my hands), and said 'let me do it.'  I was not happy.  Then the wife said 'We always bring our own lemons.'  Huh?  WTF is that?  How pretentious can you be?  I couldn't be too hard on them though.  The husband looked like he was wearing a Hefty bag with legs (fashion tip reminder - leather pants are supposed to be  tight ), and in her skin-tight skirt, she looked like two basketballs stuck in a sausage casing.  I guess these 2 never heard of age-appropriate clothes.  Good grief.  Finally, I was forced to kick out an unruly substance-abusing neighbor.  He wasn't what you would call a 'happy drunk'.  After he spilled wine on the birthday boy's new rug, I thought he had enough.  'Hey neighbor, you don't look well...why don't we go outside for some fresh air.'  He responded with a very bitter and slurred 'no.'  'Ok, neighbor, why don't we have a smoke then? [btw - I don't smoke, but was using Hal's cigs as bait].'  Now he was irritated: 'I know you're placating me...'  'Alright then, neighbor, instead of placating you, I'm telling you to get the f- out of here.'  'Absolutely not.'  Obviously, this was going nowhere, fast.  In the meantime, he knocked over the stereo and stood (more like barely balanced) in the middle of the room, on the verge of going completely postal.  Finally our friend J got him to leave.  I guess as he was being walked home (barefoot - he forgot his shoes), he told the guys - 'That blond girl was a real bitch.'  Oh, friend.  Don't you know you won't remember a damn thing in the morning?   Kind of like Hal.         "
"            80% of Awesome  By Duf 'Token' Fer  Four out of five (80%) Pandylandaz (don't hate) were in attendance at a house party on Friday night in the Highland section of St. Paul.  DJS was missed a great deal, but we still brought mad flava to the gathering.  Mad flava.  It was all good.  I had a grape jolly rancher drink, and it was smooth and sweet, a tasty treat.  I got to meet R, the divine Ms. PB's gentleman date.  I reconnected with friends I have not seen since my BUNKO days, I did not look at BB's cleavage (BB, you are leaving the Twin Cities at the height of your powers), but I was tempted, and HAL poured red wine all over my white turtleneck.  In other words, a good time was had by all.         "
"            The Five with Flava  by Duf 'St. Paul Style, Yo' Fer   1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  Like HAL, I would want a bar with snacks.  But with my snacks, I would want vegetarian food that no one knew was vegetarian.  Nachos with no meat, cheese pizza, fries, artichoke dip, stuffed mushrooms and deviled eggs, stuff like that.     2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  I would sell weed and paraphenalia you could use to smoke weed.  Just kidding.  I would sell space suits and space suit paraphenalia for the upcoming citizen space exploration.  No, really...I would own a store that sold high end electronics.  Stuff that you really can't find at Best Buy or Ultimate Electronics.  Either that or I would own I would own a golf store.     3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  American Literature.   I still dream of writing a great American novel one day.   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  How to be a pimp.  I would call it the St. Paul Pimp University.  I would get TA's for Big Pimpin' 101 Basics of Pimpin' and Big Pimpin' 102 Pimpin' Redux, but for Pimpin 501 Master Seminar on Pimpology, I would teach that bad boy myself.     5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  American rock and roll...the kind of music that Wilco makes, the kind of music the Flaming Lips make.  That is what I would make.  That, or a hardcore rap album about my life as a pimp in the upper Midwest.  Picture me on the cover with Flava Flav sunglasses and a sable coat...rings on every finger and a cane topped with a diamond.         "
"            F Me...It's the Friday Five a la DJ Shovelpants     1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   Delicious food, of course.  No, I think I'd have the kind of restaurant that doesn't have any sort of seafood, white sauce, mushrooms or anything else that I don't like in it.  If you've got a sophisticated palate, dine elsewhere friends.  Oh...I'd also call it The Insult Cafe.  I'd love it if when people come in, the host or hostess would say:  'Christ.  You want to eat here?  How many pricks in your party?   I think the people are ready for a good ol' dose of comedy with their meal.  No?  You don't think so?  Dine elsewhere, friends.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   Nostalgia.  I'm all about the nostalgia.  I would have vintage Star Wars posters, old Dukes of Hazzard lunchboxes, Stretch Armstrong dolls, Garbage Pail Kids stickers...the works.  Basically, if there was something you remembered or liked as a kid, I'd have it in stock.   'Where are the Easy-Bake Ovens?'   Right this way, ma'am.  3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  Creative writing.  I want to get to these kids at an early age and basically help them develop ideas and come up with kick-ass stories.  I'm one of those people that believe that everyone can write and I'd like to be there to unleash that potential from some of these little whipper-snappers.  I'd run it kind of different too.  Instead of just saying  'Write a book, kid.  Now.'   I'd get kids together to do cool activities that inspire and encourage the kids to keep going and learn to love it.  Not sure how it happened with me, but...   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  Well, I'm big on lyrics...so it's hard to say.  While most people are looking for a good beat or a particular guitar riff or chord to get them going, I like to hear the story or the way the words are piled together to form the song.  That being said, I think my music would probably fall somewhere in the EELS realm.  The benefit of the EELS is that they're lyrically sound and their music kicks ass.  Can't lose, in my book.         "
"            Alrighty...    1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  I would have a hole-in-the-wall bar with unremarkable food and cheap beer.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  I would have a music store (yeah, I know, a very dying breed) with listening stations.  I would lose money on the shop, but it would be kick-ass.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  The only book I would ever end up writing is a memoir, and that would only be after my affair with a world leader, or after I stumble across a cure for cancer (whichever is first).  And I would use a ghost-writer.    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  I really wouldnt like to be a teacher.  But since this is a Friday Five question, Ill say 20th Century History.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  When you say recorded, you mean burned?  Right?  If I burned an album today, it would have some U2, The Smiths, Beth Orton, Flaming Lips, and Wilco on it.  But ask me again tomorrow.          "
"            Not a bad Friday Five, folks.     If you...     1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   Indian-French fusion.  You know - duck confit with curry?  Hey, it would work!   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   Oooo...this is a good one.  I am a lover of chotchkies (although in my rather barren apartment, you wouldn't know).  I love stupid shit like candles, funky photo albums,  urlLink Paul Frank  t-shirts, Asian-inspired jewelry, my list could go on and on.   urlLink This  was my favorite store in Chicago.  I would copy it...but I'd also sell CDs from local artists and play their music in the store.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?   I would definitely write my own travel book about cool places I've been...this kinda ties into my love of planning.  I always enjoyed showing people around Chicago, and in essence, through a book, I could do the same thing, but with a wider audience.     4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?   I'd teach a film class - it would be like a book club, except you have informal discussions about a particular film.  I'm no expert on film-making, but I know what I like and what I don't like.  I also would not allow any testosterone-filled mainstream films (ie - The Mummy Returns, Men in Black, Terminator 3, or XXX).  Boring.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?   Hmmmm...a mix between the Indigo Girls, Alanis Morissette, U2, Tori Amos, and Blur.  Hey, it would work!         "
"           My life, as I know it, is now over.  I am officially  urlLink addicted to this .  Sign up for $20/month, make a 'movie wish list' and let 3 movies at a time come to your door...with a SASE and no late fees!  It's almost too simple!  BB filled me in on it (I'll have to have a word with her), and I've been adding movies to my list all day.    I may never leave my house again.  And I thought I saved myself by cancelling cable?         "

What were the last two movies you saw?   Starsky & Hutch (eh...it was okay) and Tommy Boy (on DVD).  Some asshole called me Tommy Boy in class last night.  I don't know if he was just playing off of my name or if he thought I was Chris Farely-esqe in my fatness.    3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Jesus.  I can't remember.  I plan on buying a burrito and Futurama Volume 3 on DVD today.  Does that count?  Oh...and maybe a memory card for my PS2.  Wow.  I really sound like a dork.

"            Like   urlLink The Passion   but with a Happy Ending   Mark, Bassy, and I (sans wimpy Hal) went to see  urlLink Touching the Void  at the Uptown theater last night.  It was, simply put, amazing.  We all felt like a bunch of sissies after seeing it.  The  urlLink way Kevin MacDonald filmed the documentary  and the true story aspect was  urlLink astounding .  The movie touches on the physical and spiritual dilemma of facing the unknown and overcoming one's fear in order to emerge 'reborn on the other side'. But the real reason I liked the film is that it's just one of those stories that catches your breath. (I think Bassy was a bit short of breath herself...)  However, I think Mark summed it up best.  Throughout the whole film all I could hear him mumble was 'un-fucking-believable.'         "
"           I just got my concert tickets for the Strokes show in Chicago.  Imprinted on them in big, bold letters are the words: 'No Moshing or Body Surfing.'  Forget it.  I'm not going now.         "
"            More than you ever wanted to know...   I had a great, great vacation.  There are so many places in this world that I hope (and plan) to visit.  But London is just...  very hard to not visit at least every couple of years.  For me, it's a combination of nostalgia and new discoveries.  I had some worries that this trip would be a flop - we were only going to be there 4 nights, we had a Mom with us, we all had our own 'must do' list, etc.  Thankfully, my lowered expectations paid off.  My cohorts were Angela (lived with us for about 2 months while we were in the UK, and also my roommate for this stay), Christine (a roommate the whole time I lived there), and Susan (Christine's Madre, truly a good sport when it came to our antics).  Without further ado, here's the blow-by-blow:   Wednesday  We landed in the A.M. and made our way into town and hotel.  The plan was to stay up until at least 8 or 9 pm (easier said than done), so to resist the urge to nap we dropped our bags off and headed down  urlLink Oxford Street  for shopping.  The main mission for Christine and I - getting bras at  urlLink Marks and Spencer  (it's kinda a cross between Target and Marshall Fields).  It's a sad fact that American woman cannot find quality undergarments.  Luckily, we can supplement with trips abroad and no one does it better than M&S.  Mission accomplished, we went next door to  urlLink Selfridges  (closest equivalent here - Bloomingdales) and wandered around to a cafe for coffee and cigarettes.  Revived by caffeine and nicotine we stopped in a few other stores and then headed back to the hotel to unpack and put our feet up (promising we'd keep each other awake).    I should mention here that we had the blessing/curse of forethought, and as a group decided to buy a CARTON of cigarettes when we were going through duty free.  Cost savings?  Check.  Waking up each morning questioning our sanity?  Check.  That said, here?s my closed circuit to DJS - dirty cigarettes in Europe are absolutely delicious.  Formally checking into the hotel was a bit of a fiasco (there's a reason the U.S. gets raves for customer service), so Angela and I went to the other room 'till ours was ready.  Christine, Angela and I watched  urlLink 'Father Dowling Mysteries'  on the telly (get it??  I was in England! 'telly' - he, he, he!!), while Susan napped.  Nothing like random American television (with  urlLink Tom Bosley , no less!) to add to the surreal world of jet lag.  After Father Dowling figured out the mystery of the maid being held prisoner by her employers, our room was finally ready, so we got our keys and unpacked. Quick showers and slaps to the face were administered and we headed out to dinner.  When I was buying my  urlLink Tube  ticket the (initially crabby) man on the other side of the glass asked me if I was American.    'Yeah' I replied defensively, expecting a rant.   'What do you think about  urlLink Kerry ' the man asked, 'I think he's going to go all the way!'  I paused, completely taken aback.  Sure, I know Tony Blair, but I couldn't guess who the opposition leader is.  'I, uh, don't know much about him.  It looks like he'll be the one to challenge Bush, though.'  Way to put that Political Science degree to work, HAL!! 'I think he is just like John F. Kennedy!!' the man excitedly exclaimed. 'Well, they are both from Massachusetts' I weakly replied. 'I hope he's got what it takes to beat Bush' 'Yes, he is like Kennedy, he will beat Bush!' the man smiled.  I then asked the man where he was from.  'Bangladesh' he said.  Then I went and caught my train, guiltily making a mental note to look up Bangladesh on the map when I got home.  Back from dinner we went to the 'Glenn Miller Bar' at our hotel for a night cap.  It quickly became our trip tradition to start and end each evening there (it was open 'till 7am, while pubs close at 11pm).  Back in our rooms by 11pm we congratulated each other on staying up past our goal our and fell asleep watching 'Sex And The City'.  God bless the BBC.   Thursday  Day 2 was our sight-seeing day.  We started at the  urlLink London Eye  - a new attraction for all of us.  Basically, it's a huge Ferris Wheel on the Thames, very close to Big Ben.  It takes about 25 minutes to go around in it and you can see just about everything in London from it.  It's ironic that a city with very few clear days would create such an attraction, but it worked out for us - from there we walked to the  urlLink Tate Modern  (art) gallery and crossed the Thames on the 'wobbly bridge' - the  urlLink Millennium (pedestrian) Bridge , a feat of British engineering (installed as part of the millennium celebrations) that was closed for much of the time following the grand opening because it shook and became unstable in wind.  Recently 'fixed' we braved it and lived to tell the tale.  That night we went to the play  urlLink 'When Harry Met Sally' , recently opened and starring  urlLink Luke Perry  and  urlLink Alyson Hannigan .  It was a crap show (but the good news is, it only cost $75 apiece to see it) with some smart bits.  I thought Luke was (surprisingly) good and Alyson (surprisingly) not good.  However, Luke's performance was greatly improved when he jumped out of the post-coital bed and flashed us his ass (sorry, 90210 aired during a seminal time in my life).  I'm here to tell you - Dylan's still got it!!  After the show, we went back to the hotel bar.  Around midnight, Christine and Angela pulled the lightweight routine and went up to bed.  I stayed down with Susan and we were joined by a drunk Irish dentist named Paul (he was in his mid-fifties).  He bought us a round and started hitting on Susan.  Then he asked us what we thought (or as he'd say it, 'taught') of John Kerry.  He also added that he thought Kerry was like John F. Kennedy.  Not surprisingly, he's just as popular with the Irish as he is with British immigrants from Bangladesh.  After an hour or two of Paul telling us how much he loved American woman and making love to woman (one assumes nationality is not important), Christine came down in her pajamas looking for her mother.  When we introduced Christine to Paul, he said, 'aye, Christine, I think your mother is a luhhv-ley woman'.  Figuring we were alive and relatively safe, she headed back to bed, but not before Paul could ask, 'is your father upstairs as well?'  Once we safely untangled from Paul, we called it a night.   Friday  I was on a mission to get stilton cheese as a gift for dad, so Susan and I grabbed breakfast at the hotel (and managed to avoid a hung-over Paul, eating there as well) and headed to  urlLink Harrods .  Once there, we also stopped downstairs and saw a creepy Princess Diana/Dodi Fayed memorial (Dodi's dad owns Harrods).  The memorial consisted of pictures of the two, flowers, the diamond ring (very bling) that he gave her the night they were killed, and most bizarrely, the dirty wine glasses 'preserved' from their hotel room.  It was almost like a religious shrine with relics.  Very 'ewww'.  Afterwards, we met up with Christine and Angela and did a little more shopping.  Then we did the ultimate girly 'four girls go to London' thing - we had high tea next to  urlLink Kensington Palace .  After that, we were ready for a night of true (non-tea) drinking.  Last year Angela met 4 blokes from London (get it??  I was in England!  'blokes' - he, he, he!!) while on a trip to Spain.  We met up with them (and a few of their friends) at a  urlLink pub  and then we went to a  urlLink club  full of Eurotrash.  The music was loud and bad (I distinctly remember ?Ice, Ice, Baby? being played).  I talked to a guy from Russia who?s lived in the UK for 9 years.  When I asked where he was from, he said 'Moscow'.  'So, NEAR Moscow, then?' I replied.  'Yeah, it's sort of the New Jersey of Moscow' he said.  I asked him if he'd been to the States, and he said no.  I guess that they show 'The Sopranos' on the BBC.  I made the mistake of going to the toilet, sorry, 'loo', that made the toilet in ' urlLink Trainspotting ' look spotless by comparison.  As if the floor wasn't bad enough, the attendant kept screaming about a girl who had just thrown up all over a stall.  Lovely.  The oddest thing about it all was that all I could think of was 'I'm too old for this' and 'I don't do this enough anymore'.  After many more drinks we left the club and I introduced our British hosts to the distinctly American tradition of the pinky-swear (as a sign of their commitment to visit us in the States, presumably so we can return the hospitality, though we don?t have an exact translation of the evening over here).  In the interest of full-disclosure I am told by my traveling companions that it?s at this point that I announced (or screamed, depending on who you ask), 'Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?'  My question must have gone unanswered as we then started the walk back to the hotel (graciously accompanied by our hosts), stopping half way for take-away Chinese food and eating it in an alley.  Is there anything better?  Then we finally got in a cab for the rest of our journey (serenading our cab driver on the way).  At this point, the wise choice would have been bed, but we went with plan B - the hotel bar.  After another round there (hollow legs, I guess) I said good-bye to the last two of our hosts.  When I got up to my floor the newspapers were already there and I thought to myself, 'God, I love London'.   Saturday  When I awoke the next morning, I thought, 'God, I hate London', and Angela looked at me, laughed, and said, 'Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?'  I returned a quizzical look, and shortly afterwards we had a knock at the door - someone nicely pointing out that the room key had been left in the door the night before.  Just like anyone who's hung-over, I was thrilled at the prospect of hopping a train to  urlLink Borehamwood , the town at the north end of London where we lived oh-so-long-ago.  But nostalgia tour '04 was going forward.  We went to  urlLink St. Albans  first (a little north of Borehamwood) and walked around in a daze, still trying to shake off the night before (or maybe it was just me).  Then we headed to Borehamwood and ooh-ed and ahh-ed as we passed each shop, reciting each memory, and certainly coming across as insane to the locals.  We had a pint (alright, a half-pint, we were trying our hardest) at our old pub,  urlLink The Hart and Spool .  We walked by our old house, and then back to the train and to London.  Earlier that day, the  urlLink big rugby match between Ireland and England was played (in London) .  We knew this because we almost saw someone killed in the Tube over it (Ireland won).  There was also some very foul language, too harsh for me to publish here (plus, I have no idea what they were saying - the British have very elaborate words for 'cocksucker').  In my humble opinion, there are better ways to die then getting beaten to death over a rugby game.  There is a reason why the UK has very restrictive gun laws.  We had half of Ireland staying at our hotel, so later that night the bar was like St. Patrick's Day times 10.  For our final night, we headed to the other side of London for an Indian meal (in the east end there is an area called  urlLink Brick Lane ).  We got horribly lost, and it wasn't the type of area to get lost in.  Thankfully we managed to figure our way out before the restaurants closed for the night.  On the Tube ride home, Angela started talking to a group of dread-locked teenagers.  They bonded enough for her to start dancing on a train platform while one of them did a beat-box.    Sunday  On our final morning, we sleepily and almost silently caught our cab to our train and our train to our airport.  And that was it.          "
"            How you doin?  hey folks, sorry to have been a lame-o poster lately. what can I say but...i got my money on my mind and my mind on my money...that's sorta true if only I had more money to actually think about...but I have been preoccupied as I start in on the home stretch here in the land 'o lakes. I give notice on Thursday, folks....I have to admit that it's a little scary but I'm happy to be moving on from here. And besides, I love traffic. ;)   Other things:   DJS  -- not enough room on Pandyland for ya, huh? Or did the hazing finally get to you? I know Duf takes his hazing duties seriously but c'mon...a little stroll through the grocery store naked while tied to Duf who insists you dance for him in the freezer aisle never hurt anyone...  HAL  -- let's spill the London deets, yeah!  Panda  -- the land of no cable isn't all that bad...wait, I'm back in the land of cable again. what am I saying? it rocks!

"            Being back is good (Im officially broke, and my liver and lungs can only take so much abuse) and its bad (seriously  I dont think Ive ever had so much fun on a vacation).   I'll have more about my trip later (hands down highlight - Luke Perry's ass).  Breaks my heart to hear I missed the snow suckers!   Heres my FF:    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?   How bad am I?  I cant remember.  I think it was Mrs. Scarp.    2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   Muppet Babies.  Dunno why, but I just remember being really, really excited about watching it.   3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Amy Flood.  But she moved away and changed schools.  Thats when I learned the world is cold and cruel.    4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   Capn Crunch WITH Crunch Berries.  Or, Peanut Butter flava.  Also, Lucky Charms and Flintstones cereal were perfectly acceptable to the palate.  I once had an allergic reaction (broke out in hives) to Rainbow Bright cereal.     5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   I grew up within walking distance of my first elementary school (I went there K-3 and was bused somewhere else 4-6).  Every day, school would let out and Id start the brief walk home.  About half way there, Id stop, have a seat on the sidewalk, and eat my lunchbox leftovers.  Mom would then pick me up (in a car) where I was picnicking.  To this day Im not really sure why she picked us (my brothers went there too, but we didnt attend at the same time) up on the way home vs. at school, or even not picking us up at all.  Typical of most of my weird behavior, its only recently that I understand why everyone thought my picnic habit was funny or odd.          "
"            A Friday Ago Five  By Duf Fer   1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)?    Kansas City (I'm going to stand on the corner of 12th Street and Vine).   2. What is your favorite number?   65 (I needed it for Bingo as a lad and got it).   3. Vanilla or chocolate?    Is this a reference to my taste in women? They are both appealing and I have had fun with chocolate, but usually go with standard vanilla. Wait, flavors of ice cream? Vanilla.   4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?    Fiction (make it classic lit if you got it).  Speaking of which, I am reading 'Frankenstein' right now.  Mary Shelley wrote it when she was 19, and it is amazing.  Very beautiful and extremely well written.     5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?   It is medium.  The main thing is...it is too small.  It is a full size bed, and it is fine for me and Mrs. Duf, but when TinyE joins the show (bed hog of the century), it's too crowded.  We need a King.           "
"            Hey, I Had to Shovel as Soon As I Got Home  By Duf 'I miss you all' Fer   1.  ...your first grade teacher's name?   Here is a little secret about Duf.

On Saturday we usually watched Looney Tunes.    3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Chris.  He is the coolest guy in the world.  Check out the Vitae:  Duke (still sucks) undergrad; Iowa Writers Workshop for a Masters.  Harvard Law.  Ouch.       4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   I was not allowed to eat pre-sweetened cereal, but I WAS allowed to sweeten my cereal.  Anyway, my favorite cereal was Raisin Bran.      5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   Play outside.  Kickball, baseball, football, tag, cowboys and Indians, etc.           "
"            I've Had It.   Panda, I hear you.  This snow shit is for the birds.  That's the one thing I hate about March.  Sure, it's all nice and the snow starts to melt again and you start looking for your shorts and what-not, but then BAM!  Like a sack of bricks, another 18 feet of snow jostles you in the cash n' prizes and you slap your head like some backwoods yokel.  'Well, shucks!  I guess winter ain't over after all!'  I'm telling you, if it wasn't for DJ LZ, my family, all my friends, my firefighting gig and a few other things, I'd be on the first road out of here.  That ain't the case, kids.  I'm here for the long haul.  Triple gay snow or not.  What time is it?  3:30-ish? Shit.  I've got time.  Here's my Friday 5.   What was...    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?    Miss Gazda.  This was in Catholic grade school, but man she was smoking hot.  I'm telling you.   I was only six years old (or so) at the time, but I couldn't help but wonder what her boobies looked like.  Is that sharing too much?  Sorry.  These are the things my little church-y schoolboy head thought of.  No wonder I wasn't cut out for this Jesus shit.    2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   This is going to sound totally ass-wonky, but I really, really liked the Disney cartoon 'The Gummi Bears.'  You're thinking:   Man, DJS.  What's so cool about Gummi Bears?   Well, I'll tell you.  They weren't like the adventures of little pieces of candy running around.  They were like...Medieval Bears and they lived in a forest and they went on adventures and quests and stuff.  It was very cool.      3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Some kid in my nursery school named Mike.  I can't remember his last name, but we were friends until I moved to a different school to go to kindergarten.  I think I even invited him to a birthday party, but the asshole never showed.  I'm still upset about this.    4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   Oh, that's easy.  I liked Cap'n Crunch.  Like Panda, we didn't get too much sugary cereals, but when my parents removed the sugar prohibition, the flood gates opened.  From then on, I kept turning to the oval-headed captain in blue for my cereal delight.    5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?    Another easy one.  My little brother Dr. Rob PhD and I would immediately head downstairs to either play Legos or play Atari 2600 until my eyes burned.  Come to think of it...not much has changed.  Well, except for the Legos, my brother and the Atari 2600.         "
"           Let's just say I'm pretty damn jealous of Duf and Hal right now.  Not only did we get  dumped  on last night, but I have to drive through this crap all the way to Beer City in Sconie.  F- me.  This is  almost  as bad as my trip to Duluth for work this past Wednesday.  Almost.  One more thing - I'm already sick of the political ads on TV.  How many more months until November?  Count 'em - NINE.  Thanks, G Dub.  Now finally, a decent FF:   What was...    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?   Miss Hirsh.  She was definitely my favorite teacher in grade school.  She was the kindest, most patient woman I have ever known.  And I remember her very straight teeth for some reason.   2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   The Smurfs, hands down.  I especially liked the evil Smurfs that would bite the Smurf tails to infect the other Smurfs.  That was Smurfy.   3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Amy Trudeau.  I hear she has 2 kids now and is living in northern Sconie.  We used to ride bikes everywhere together and played Barbies and Cabbage Patch Kids.  We also were on my swing set all summer long.   4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   When Star Wars, etc was big, my little bro and I really got into the cereal 'C3PO's'.  It was kind of like Alpha-Bits.  I also liked Cocoa Krispies.  My mom didn't allow sugar cereals that often, so these were real treats.   5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   I would always eat a thing of yogurt for a snack (I'm a creature of habit) and then I would watch 'Saved By the Bell' with my brother and we would laugh and laugh about how much of a dork Screech was.  Hmmmm, maybe the dorks were the kids watching that gay-ass show?         "

"            Weekend Recap   1) Do not use the valet service at the Loring Pasta Bar.  I got my Toyota backed into and the front bashed in by an out-of-control valet trying to quickly park a Lexus SUV.  They took full responsibility, thank God, but what a pain to find the time to get your car fixed.  The woman who owned the Lexus was typical (picture Edina native, lots of gold and make-up, and a Gucci bag).  After I told her she didn't have anything to worry about since she barely got a scratch, she put me in my place by telling me 'my husband owns 2 dealerships and honey, if you get a scratch on a car like this, you get it fixed.'  So what you're saying is, you're husband is a swindler and you're a gold-digging whore?  Got it.  2) 'The Lord of the Rings Show' (aka 'The Oscars') was a snore.  I heard Billy Crystal got good reviews.  He's gotta be paying someone off because he made me groan through the whole show.  As Randy said, 'The Oscars wouldn't run so late if they didn't give all the time to no-talent-ass-clowns like this guy.'  Yep.  3) I saw  urlLink The Passion  on Sunday (my version of going to church).  The movie kicked my ass.  Hard.  We had to stop at the bar next door for a couple of margaritas afterward.  Here's my take:   Was the movie overly violent?   Yes.  The worst part was 11 minutes of JC being scourged by the Romans.  You can go to the bathroom or close your eyes during this part.  Mel definitely takes it to the limit.   Was it an accurate depiction of the Gospels?   Yes.  Dead on.   Was it an accurate depiction of actual history?   Probably not. You see 'Mel's version' of Pontias Pilate who, historically, was a sadist who routinely crucified people without trial.  Mel made him out to be almost compassionate.   Will it make some people reaffirm their faith?  I think so.  I left the theater thinking I really needed to make a better effort and go to church more.  Some people need tragic experiences to reassess their faith.  Some only need a powerful movie.   Is  The Passion  a good film?   It is a great film.  Granted, I may never see it again, but I'm glad I experienced it at least once.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.   ps  - you'll enjoy it more if you have some knowledge of the Gospels and the Passion story.  Gibson doesn't introduce each character that well, so even I had questions about who was who.   pps  - I liked how Mel took liberties with involving the Devil in the story more than the bible does.  It shows how JC had a choice to stop everything during the entire ordeal (he was tempted more than just once to call it quits), but he  chose  to follow through with his sacrifice.  Ok.  I'm off the pulpit now.  Back to our regularly scheduled lighter program.         "
"            Sometimes I Go Into eBay Looking for a Microbus  By Duf 'Right ON' Fer   Here is a 'Terms of Sale' description from an actual microbus auction:   Ok put DOWN the haki-sak and listen up. I'm trying to SELL this car. The convention is that the person buying something will hand over some scraps of paper that were imprinted by the government with the words  FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE. They have numbers on the corners. Look around...You HAVE some of these? GREAT! Now look at the numbers and see if when you add up one number from each paper that the total is equal or more than you are going to bid on this. No cheating, only use the number in one corner! Don't count each one 4 times. All set? GOOD! Perfect. You can go from being a bidder to a buyer. That's really cool. What is really UN-cool is bidders that go from being bidders to DEADBEATS. You bid, you buy, you own. Any other way gets you bad feedback and maybe a visit from Rocky and Guido. 'Get in da caa, Da boss wants ta talk two's ya....' Make sure that you have your finances in place BEFORE bidding. Don't plan on making a killing with your stash after the fact. Make your deals and have cash-in-fist.  I've got all the woodstock items a person could need so no trades. Once you become the winning bidder you need to grab the skateboard and rumble over to fedex and get me a 10% nonrefundable deposit within 3 days of the auction end. THEN you will have 10 days to get me the rest of the money and I would prefer that you collect your car. CAN it sit here a bit longer than that? Yes but if that is your plan, let me know before bidding. Ask your questions BEFORE bidding! Yes I can take other photos and like that. It is sold as is and all the good stuff and any bad stuff is equally YOURS. Buyer will have to suppy own leather headband,tiedye and purple granny glasses. Buyer is responsable for shipping. Possible delievery on the central east coast for expenses. Check on this before bidding.  Far out......................................          "

"            Uprising of the Oldies   Not sure if I've told y'all, but I've been taking a community ed watercolor class every Tuesday night.  Needless to say, I'm the youngest in the class by about 40 years.  It's ok, though, because it gives me a creative outlet and a chance to relax.  At least that was the intent...  Last night's class was a little disturbing.  I got to the classroom early so I helped our cute little 68-year-old German teacher with setting up the room.  A couple oldies trickled in and they were not shy about sharing bodily function stories. 'Oh Gladys, I just got my pictures back from my colonoscopy...they look beautiful.'  First of all, I didn't know anyone would ever have the desire to see photos from a very invasive butt test, let alone describe them as 'beautiful'.  Gross.  Then one of the more outspoken students (if you could be any more outspoken than talking about your ass) brought up politics out of the blue.  'If 'that guy' buys his way into the presidency again, I'm moving to Canada.'  I heard some mumblings and then some 'uh-huh's' in agreement.  One of the women referred to G-W as 'The Next Hitler' and someone said 'who would be dumb enough to vote for that guy??'  The oldies then went off on a tirade, which I don't really feel like repeating here.  Needless to say, I kept my mouth shut during this whole episode.  OK, let's get a few things straight.  First of all, I took an art class to do just that - art.  I did not sign up to get politically blasted by some 70-year-old liberals.  Everyone has a right to his/her opinion, but what makes me so damn mad about people who get antsy about politics is when they don't take into account that they may be talking to a mixed audience.  I'll admit, I voted for Bush in the last election (I'd consider myself more fiscally conservative than socially).  I'll also admit that I don't think he's the smartest guy to ever sit in the Oval Office, therefore I don't know if I'll be voting for him again.  However, I would NEVER go off on a politician I didn't like in front of people I didn't know.  To me, that's just plain rude.  Especially since I just want to paint a picture of some f-ing sunflowers for cryin' out loud.  Go on, move to the so-called utopia you call Canada.  Then maybe I could paint in peace.          "
"            So A Woman Comes Up to Me...  By Duf 'How much money do you have in the bank?'  Fer  I was listening to a radio program last week, and a reporter who was interviewing a rancher asked this question:  'How many cows do you have?'  The rancher replied:  'Enough to eat all the grass.  What, do you work for the IRS?'  The point is that it is rude to ask overly personal questions of people (sometimes even if you know them well).    Anyway, a co-worker gave me a survey and asked me if I would complete it for her class at North Hennepin Community College.  I said sure, without reading it.  Here are the questions...with my answers  SA = Strongly Agree MA = Moderately Agree NAND = Neither Agree Nor Disagree MD = Moderately Disagree SD = Strongly Disagree  Age = 36 Sex = M Marital Status = married Non-marital relationship = no  It is important for men to be masculine.  MD  It is important for women to be nurturing and sociable.  MD  I cry to relieve tension and stress.  SD  I am an emotional person.  SA  I have been abusive to others when I have been angry.  MA  I am competitive when I play sports.  SA  My significant other knows my deepest feelings.  MA  I hold my feelings in when I am with people I don't know well.  MA  I enjoy cooking.  MA  I enjoy the company of children.  MA  As a child I played with dolls.  MA  I think it is acceptable for a woman to smoke a cigar.  NAND  I think it is as acceptable for a woman to smoke a cigar as a man.  SA  I prefer a short hair style for men.  NAND  I think men should shave all of their body hair.  SD  Women should be allowed to be priests.  SA  I feel that it is important for women to know how to cook.  MA  I find muscular women unattractive.  MD  I feel uncomfortable seeing two men holding hands in public.  MD  Men who pierce their ears tend to be more feminine.  MD  Men who get their fingernails manicured tend to be more feminine.  MD  I think women should shave their legs.  NAND  I have less respect for men who have traditionally feminine jobs like being a nurse or secretary.  SD    What do you think is an ideal job?   An ideal job is one that is satisfying, rewarding, challenging and varied.  It is one that provides responsibility, authority and adequate compensation.  A job that provides independence and allows for a balanced life (accommodating other priorities like family and leisure time) is also ideal.   If women held all or most of the political positions, do you think the country would be different?  How?   I don't think the country would be different.  Over the past few decades, a lot of women have occupied leadership roles in government and in business.  I work in an industry with a comparatively large number of women in executive roles.  They are governed and limited by the same success criteria as everyone else (profitability).  It is also true for women in government though the criteria are different (the 'greater good', the 'will of the people' and re-election).  England did not change under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and India was largely the same under Indira Ghandi's rule.  Changing the percentages so that women held all or most positions might influence issues or governmental structure, but I don't feel it would change the country.   What do you like or dislike about your gender?    What I like about my gender is...   ...some of the physiological advantages of being a man:  our systems seems less complex, less finicky, and less impactful on our day-to-day physical well-being.  We don't have menstruation or menopause, and our maintenance requirements don't really get invasive until we are 40 or so years old.     What I don't like about my gender is...   ...the same thing I don't like about gender in general.  The role is so weighted down by  constructs and stereotypes - by societal expectations.  Women should comport to Cosmopolitan notions of beauty.  Men should be strong (physically and emotionally) and they should provide (well).           "
"           I know we all get strange requests at work from time to time...from our bosses, customers, and even the mail guy.  I was thinking of what mine have been over the years, so I thought I'd turn it into a Tuesday One.   What has been your strangest work request(s)?   This had to have been during my year stint with a MN-based company where I ran incentive programs.  The first program I ran (for a certain high-profile investment company) was in San Francisco.  It was a trip all the top sales people had won - all expenses-paid.  I was in charge of the VIP's for the 10 days (the CEO, his wife, and everyone in between).  The CEO was not happy with the toilet paper at the hotel.  Guess who had to get him some Charmin?  The CEO's wife had to go shopping.  Guess who had to hold her purse in the couture shops?  On a different program to Beaver Creek, CO we encountered a trip director's worst nightmare: virtually EVERYONE on the trip had lost their luggage.  It didn't matter what part of the country they came from - No one had clothes on the first day (some even went the whole week).  Of course, this was tragic to the women who had no make-up (or dresses, for that matter) for the first night's black-tie dinner, but we heard the biggest stink from the guy whose wife's BREAST PUMP was in their suitcase.  'I demand someone get us a new breast pump.  My wife and kid are dyin' here!'  I thought I'd vomit on the spot.  Guess who got elected for breast-pump-searching-duty in the middle of a resort town?  Yep, yours truly.  After searching all over town, we finally went to a local hospital and got your ol' run-of-the-mill breast pump.  When we gave it to the guy, you'd think he would have rejoiced.  'Thanks, but this doesn't look like the one she had.  I'll let you know.'  I had no idea there were so many varieties?  Needless to say, he came back unsatisfied.  'My wife demands a better one.  I don't care what it takes.  This one is killing her!'  Then I heard the best 'get your ass fired' quote from my coworker: 'Listen, Mr. So-and-So.  If you're expecting us to find a fur-lined breast pump it just ain't going to happen!  Tell her to deal with it.'  I promise if I'm ever rich, I will treat all people with dignity.  Or at least I'll never demand a better breast pump or softer toilet paper.         "

"            Some highlights from the best Mankato wedding of the year (considering it's the only one I've been to this year (and the only one I'll probably ever attend), it automatically qualifies):   A most delicious buffet - meat and potatoes shut me up for a full 20 minutes  Duf dancing with me during the 5-years-together-only couple dance (he didn't hear that announcement)  The fruit punch (Duf or Hal could elaborate on this)  The white wine (all I'm gonna say is, I only had 3-4 glasses and couldn't feel my extremities - either I was actually drinking vodka, or someone slipped me a mickey)  Bon Jovi/DJS karaoke - w/air band  Wake Me Up, Before You Go-Go - Molly Ringwald-inspired dancing ensued  My hand ended up in some guy's mouth at the end of the evening.  I guess that's how I said good-bye...in front of his fianc?  Political debates - did you know  urlLink 'The Manics'  are Socialist?  You better.  Retching out of Hal's car window in the rain on the side of the highway.  That was pleasant for all parties involved, I'm sure.  Luckily, Duf was sleeping (but NOT snoring).  DJ LZ sliding on her knees (in her wedding dress - hard core) across the dance floor into DJS' arms.  Dropping all the contents of Hal's bag - whose cell phone is this?  Speaking of cell phones, Hal ended up with 2 extra at the end of the night.  ....Looking back on it now, we should have just stayed in Mankato.  A loud HOLLA goes out to Hal for driving our asses home.  Quote from her: 'I've never received more spoken and e-mailed apologies after a wedding, ever.'  Photos coming soon.         "
"            Like a Good Neighbor   I'd like to go into detail about the wedding of DJS and DJ LZ, but Hal and Duf would have to fill in the last 2 hours of that event.  It's a little hazy (plus, I caught some weird stomach bug.  The delicious buffet food must have gotten the better of me...).  A month or so ago I got a knock on my apartment door.  This by itself is weird since no one can get into our building without me buzzing him/her in.  I first thought it was my building manager, but to be safe I asked 'who is it?'  'It's your neighbor from downstairs.'  Immediately I thought 'oh crap, he's coming to complain about me making too much noise or something.'  So I sheepishly opened the door.    Neighbor:'Hi, I'm Brian.  I live in the apartment underneath you.  I play my guitar at night and was wondering if I make too much noise.' Me: 'No, I haven't heard a thing.' Neighbor: 'OK, well if it ever bothers you, let me know.'  I think he wanted me to ask more about his guitar playing or about him in general, since after he asked about the noise he awkwardly stood there for what seemed like minutes.  Me: 'Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something.  It was nice to meet you.'  Door closed. (and double-locked.  Something wasn't right about this guy.)  Last night I got another mysterious knock.  Again, instinctively, I asked 'who is it?'  'It's your neighbor from downstairs.'  So I thought he had come back to make sure he really hadn't been making more noise.  I told him 'I haven't heard a thing.  You're fine.'  Neighbor: 'Oh good...actually I came up here because I was wondering if I could borrow your vacuum cleaner.' (kind of an odd request) Me: 'Um, sure.  Is yours broken?' Neighbor: 'It's kind of in a transitional phase.'  (Yes, he actually said that.) Me:'Ok, here you go.' Neighbor: 'I'll bring it back in a half hour.'  He knocked again in a half hour, and when I opened the door I asked what his name was again.  'Pria.'  Me: ''Pria'?  That's an unusual name.  Where does that come from?' Neighbor: (he looked like he didn't want to answer) 'Actually, it's my Buddhist name.  But I try not to tell too many people about it.  I picked 'Pria' because I thought it sounded more American.  I try to keep it under wraps.' Me: (I'm thinking, 'This guy probably took one yoga class and decided he'd be Buddhist. He's as Minnesotan as the Vikings.')  'Ok, whatever.  But I thought your name was Brian.  Are you the same guy who came up here a few weeks ago?' Neighbor: 'Oh, well, sometimes I slip and give people a different name.  My peers have much more Indian-based names, but 'Pria' is my name.' Me: 'Alright.  Later, then, Pria.'  Again, I closed my door and double-bolted it.  'Pria' scares me.         "

Dong replies, drunk as a skunk on the front lawn: 'Automobile?? (makes car crashing noises) lake. big lake.' -Grandpa & Donger 'Sixteen Candles'    3.

In the falling light of a northern sun If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river Men go crazy in congregations But they only get better One by one... One by one...' -Sting from 'All this Time' on The Soul Cages   4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable?   the people definitely. and an open bar.    5. What do you daydream about?

Gotta agree with Panda, Clerks has some gems basically anything Jay says.  For the more obscure yet still close to my heart, Ill go with Lorna! or I know what you are youre a hustler! from the classic Mystic Pizza.  Youd be surprised at how quotable that movie is.   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    Impossible to pick one.

What makes a wedding fun and memorable?    The people, hands down.  The dress, the centerpieces, the music, the flowers, the booze - all nice, but it really all depends on the happy couple and their guests  are they fun?  Just like any other party.   5.

"            Yes, Let's Start Our Own Five!  By Duf 'Power to the People' Fer   1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    Oh, it a great play, and I like the movie with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton too. Albee is a genius.  It is perhaps his finest work.  What?  Oh...   2. What's your favorite movie line?    First I have to say that when I read Panda's blog and found out that she was in high school when  Single White Female  came out, and then I thought of where I was at that same time, I felt as old as the hills.  Pause for bone creak, take Geritol.  My favorite movie quote comes from the Woody Allen movie  Crimes and Misdemeanors . One subplot of the movie is that Clifford Stern (the Woody Allen character) is making a substantive documentary that he hopes to sell to PBS featuring a minor philosopher, Professor Levy, who has amazingly profound insights on life (but ends up killing himself, natch).  At one point, the professor says:  'We're all faced throughout our lives with agonizing decisions, moral choices. Some are on a grand scale, most of these choices are on lesser points.  But we define ourselves by the choices we have made.  We are, in fact, the sum total of our choices.  Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly.  Human happiness does not seem to be included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet, most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying and even try to find joy from simple things, like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.'  With a nod to imdb.   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    I literally could pick at least 100.  There are so many lines from so many artists and so many songs.  I will pick a few:  From Wilco's 'Reservations':  ...I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say How can I get closer and be further away From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie  I've got reservations about so many things but not about you...  From Bruce Springsteen's 'Ghost of Tom Joad':  ...The highway is alive tonight.   But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.   I'm sittin' downhere in the campfire light  with the ghost of old Tom Joad...  From Atmosphere's (a.k.a. MC Slug) 'Shhh' (which is an ode to Minneapolis):  ...got trees and vegetation in the city I stay The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space The women outnumber the men two to one Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day And the jobs ain't really too hard to find In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme...    4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable? (good luck, DJS!)   Play 'Summer Nights' and 'Brick House' all you want:  never, ever, ever play 'I Knew the Bride when She Used to Rock and Roll' and don't ever, ever, ever, ever play a Meatloaf song.  Ever.  I have been to weddings that cost $500, and I have been to weddings that cost $500,000.  For me, what makes a wedding more than anything else, more than the reception, the food, the dress, the DJ, the band, the amount of booze, the fact that the party went on and on until the break of dawn is that there is some moment during the ceremony when the love that the couple feels for each other overwhelms the room.  If that tender moment is present, and it is sincere and palpable, then the wedding, to me, is both fun and memorable.    5. What do you daydream about?    Lots of things.  Golf, travel, writing and ideas, my daughter, my wife, food, friends, co-workers, violence, art, sport, but mostly sex.  If I am being totally honest, then I would admit that I daydream about sex a lot.  In fact, my mind is starting to wander now...          "
"            Our Own Friday Five    1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    Most humans who encounter a wolf would probably be afraid of it, especially if it were big and bad. So the answer is: most humans.    2. What's your favorite movie line?    This is totally random but in high school a friend of mine and I really got into the movie  Single White Female .  I worked at a movie theater during the time it was out, and it was playing at my theater, so we probably saw it at least 10 times.  There was a scene where the psycho roommate, Hedy (Jennifer Jason Leigh's character) dressed up as the normal roommate, Allie (Bridget Fonda) and gave Allie's boyfriend oral pleasure (weird and gross, I know).  Afterwards, when the guy finally figured out it wasn't actually his girlfriend (like a guy wouldn't know...c'mon) Hedy whispers very eerily in his ear, 'Hey, Mr. Sleepy Guy.'  I actually used that as one of my quotes in my senior yearbook.  Of course, no one got the reference, which is probably for the best.  Another one would be from  Clerks  and is very appropriate for the impending weekend: 'Time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!'   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    Not sure if this has been asked before...I think mine would be from the song 'So Cruel' by U2 - 'And you need her like a drug.'  I mean, how HOT is that?   4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable? (good luck, DJS!)   Not too formal, good music, decent food, and an obviously happy couple.  The best weddings I have been to were ones where the bride wasn't going ape-shit over the details, but having fun with the guests.  Oh, and they can't play the 2 dumbest wedding songs ever: 'Summer Nights' and 'Brick House'.  I'll sit those 2 out, thanks.   5. What do you daydream about?

Ended up loving it, but eventually came to his senses and moved back to Mpls.   HAL  - moved to London from Mpls.  Had 3 dear friends with her, and still had a hell of a go at first (I didn't know my tear ducts could be put through such strenuous use).  Going there was the best choice I've ever made.  Eventually came to my senses and moved back to Mpls.   Duf  - moved to D.C. from Kansas.  Can't speak for the success of the move, but we all know where he lives today.  Point is, homesickness is not just for 12 year-olds at summer camp.  And it's not all bad.  I think that you'll be feeling a lot better in the next few weeks (unless, of course, you're made ill by traffic).  In the meantime, I prescribe much blogging and phone use.  And cut yourself a break, fight the frustration of not being able to fast-forward.  Bask in the uncertainty (how great is it that you're not staring a cube wall right now?!) and scary-ness (I don't think 'bored senseless' comes to mind right now)!  Some day, what you've done this past week will seem unthinkable.  And I think it's pretty great to be in the part of your life while it's all still possible.  My biggest concern... Bobby and Whitney live down there.  They are bad influences.  Please avoid them at all costs, BB!!  I don't care how badly you seek 'new friends'!         "
"           So I've got a bit of insomnia this evening. Can't seem to shut the ol noggin down. having some anxiety-causing thoughts about moving, career change, loneliness..you know the usual stuff when you make huge life-altering change(s). I just want to fast forward through this down cycle and get to where I'm going to go, you know? gimme my instant gratification. I made the leap and I want to be rewarded...now. Of course, I know that life doesn't work that way but it's uncomfortable to be uncomfortable. I know we learn a lot about ourselves when we're taken outside our comfort zones, and it's good to really challenge yourself, yadda, yadda, yadda...but those principles aren't all that comforting at 1:43am on a Thursday morning in a strange city without friends and all you wanna do is go to sleep. but this will pass and I know I will arrive at where I'm supposed to be one day. I guess it's just a normal evening of insomnia...         "

"            Scripted Press Conference  By Duf 'Trying to be Fair' Fer  I need to start by saying that I although I am a (Big D) Democrat (always have been, always will be - well unless a Socialist Party gains momentum), I do have a healthy list of Republicans that I have liked.  Arne Carlson has to go down as one of the best Governors Minnesota has ever had, and I quite admire John McCain.  Eisenhower and Ford were not so bad, and (believe it or not) I find much to admire in the policies of George H.W. Bush the elder (a multilateralist who was moderate and broke his promise ('read my lips no new taxes') because it was for the good of the nation - in other words, he put our interests above his own, the definition of leadership) and Nixon (he opened relations with China and took us off the Gold Standard).  Teddy Roosevelt basically started Presidential environmentalism and must be credited for the strength of our national parks system.  So I feel I can be somewhat unbiased in evaluating Presidents.  I must also add that my favorite quality in a President is intelligence.  Vision is a very close second, and charisma is a somewhat distant third.  That is why I absolutely adore Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter (not a terribly effective President, but the best former President of all time).  That is part of Dick Nixon's appeal to me.  Yes, he was icky in a lot of respects, but he was brilliant too.  Same with Clinton (who is intelligent, had a vision and had oodles of charisma.  Boy did he have charisma.  He had, as it turns out, too much charisma).    The lack of intelligence that I perceive in George W. Bush and that I perceived in Ronald Reagan is the center of my issue with them.  You cannot lead if you are not able to master the information, retention, strategic and diplomatic requirements of the job.  If you are not the master of all the facts and figures, you cannot grasp complexities and subtleties, and you cannot  connect the dots .   Here is one part of my point.  Reagan used to clear his calendar for two days in advance of a State of the Union address (just as an actor memorizes lines...). Bush, returned from 'vacation' last night to hold a 'scripted press conference' (not my words) where he visited with the press for one hour and took questions after a 20 minute speech.  The questions were (for the most part) submitted in advance, and the answers were scripted.  When one question was asked off the script, the President replied, without humor, that he 'wished you would have sent me that question in advance so that I could have prepared a response.'  The question was (paraphrasing)  you once said that the biggest mistake you made was trading Sammy Sosa.  Now that you have been President for three years, would that still qualify as your biggest mistake?   It hurts my heart that our leader does not have the ability to think on his feet and master a wide arrange of facts and information (I wondered during the press conference what he would have done if an unscripted question on Uzbekistan was asked.).  Yes, the mistake question is a tricky question.  Bush cannot admit mistakes related to 9-11 if he wants to be re-elected, and, in order to be responsive, he needed to come up with something that would qualify as a mistake (how about  hiring Paul O'Neill?).   Presidents who don't think on their feet and who lack their own ideas are not able to govern or lead.  They are essentially figure heads.  It all reminds me of the Wizard of Oz when the curtain gets pulled back and you find a diminutive man speaking into an amplifier.  Presidents like Reagan and Bush Light are at the mercy of their advisors.  No modern President can succeed without counsel, and I don't want to be misunderstood, but ultimately, we all do better when the President seeks input and then makes the final decision on what course we will take (see, e.g. President Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs Incident).  I'm sorry, Presidents who spend days preparing for speeches and Press Conferences do not inspire that kind of image for me.           "

"            Fuh-fuh-fuh Friday Fizzy:   By DJS    1. What do you do for a living?   God, I hate answering this question.  I'm a #!$@ing trainer, okay?  Happy?  Oh, but I'm also an on-call firefighter/EMT, so I guess that makes it a little better, doesn't it?   2. What do you like most about your job?  Main Job - Mad freedom - Get to do the 'creative' things around the office (videos, websites, newsletter) - The peeps I work with (Duf, HAL, Hawkeye, The Josh, DJ LZ)  Other Job - Saving lives - Breaking down doors - Putting out fires - Talking to/comforting patients - Driving the big trucks - My new firefighting friends - The list goes on...   3. What do you like least about your job?   For my main job: I honestly don't care about the company.  Really.  I care about the people in the company, but that's it.  I don't get excited about new technologies or new changes in management or name-changes or any of that unimportant crap.  It's hard to get excited about making some big fat slob, that I've never met, rich.  My Other Job: I'll get back to you on that.  So far, I like just about everything about it.  I even like washing the trucks and ambulances.    4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   Main job: I showed up.  Other job: Someone (especially kids) didn't make it.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?   Duf's got me pegged.  I want to write for my full-time job.  I don't even need to be rich.  I'd be happy making what I make now writing.  That way I can raise whatever kids Laura spits out and I'll feel more fulfilled career-wise.  In lieu of that, I might pursue becoming a paramedic so that when I jump ship here to fight fires and save lives full-time, I'll be F'-in irresistible.         "

A number of things: Learning new things about something I'm very interested in: fitness Not going to work and sitting in a cubicle all day.  part-time musician gig: I love performing in bars and clubs. part-time jobber: little to no responsibility at work.   part-time moocher: I like the house I'm living in for the next 6 mos (thanks, bro!)   3. What do you like least about your job?   Student: can't say yet. maybe the commute. Musician: hauling gear Jobber: not making enough money for bills  and  savings Moocher: not giving my bro and sister-in-law as much cash as I would like for letting me stay here.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   I'm tired and running late.    5. What other career(s) are you interested in?

You're given tasks and need to manage and prioritize them until they're completed.  What a load of horse shit.   2. What do you like most about your job?   I finally have a boss who respects me and thinks I have some semblance of intelligence...although I haven't had a performance review yet.  My company has been known to be a bit passive-aggressive and she may secretly hate me but I won't officially know this until a year from now.  The other thing I like is my vacation - I started with 23 days and plan on using every single one.  Carry over some to next year?  I don't think so.   3. What do you like least about your job?   The industry I'm in isn't exactly the most thrilling.  Case in point: here are a few subject lines from my e-mails...'Renewal Appeal Time Study', 'Document Imaging - a Cost-Benefit Analysis', and 'Medical Underwriting Statistics.'  All sleepers...Case closed.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   ...I'm bored out of my freakin' mind.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?   If I could do it all over again I would have done something related to medicine - either a pharmacist or dermatologist (the only type of doctor who can't outright kill someone - unless, of course, you misdiagnose skin cancer).  And they make a damn killing by just prescribing skin cream.  If I'd start something new with my current skills/education, I'd go into sales.  I'd have to find something to sell that I really believe in - maybe I'd try dabbling in real estate.         "

"            I Need to Respond, This is My Forum  By Duf 'More Discreet than Condi' Fer  Okay, so no doubt you have heard Condoleezza Rice's denial that our affair from August 2nd of 2001 through November of that same year, have any impact on national security.  You also probably heard Dr. Rice's dismissive explanation that 'opposites attract' in response to questioning about how she could have a liaison with me when my views are not aligned well with the administration.    First, I want to say that both Condi and I never imagined that our time together would become a focal point for the 9/11 Commission.  We both wanted our love to be a quiet storm, an undetonated bomb.  If either of us felt that there would be national security implications, we would have stopped immediately (although, I must say, we were both powerless to stop it at the time, powerless I tell you, powerless).    Second:  yes, it is true, we are political opposites.  However, in the bedroom.  I cannot tell you the extent of our accord.  There, my friends, we were perfectly aligned.    Perfectly.         "

"            The Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time  By Duf 'I've Studied for More than 20 Years' Fer  As you all know, I love The Pixies.  When they were making music, they just had a way of really reaching me.  I still listen to their work, and it still rocks me.  I'm thrilled that they are reuinited.  If only they had longevity on their side.  Many of you also know I love R.E.M.  Steeped in a rich history, and they have been making consistently good music since 1979.  Their live shows are good too (not great, but good)  The Talking Heads were touched by God, there's no doubt about it.    The Ramones, the Beach Boys, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Velvet Underground, The Allman Brothers, Metallica, The Grateful Dead (and perhaps Crosby, Stills & Nash - but not Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (Neil is a dirty Canadian), The Mamas and the Papas on  California Dreamin'  alone), and The Doors all deserve much praise and mention.  I can't ignore Pearl Jam and Nirvana either.  I also have a soft spot in my heart for the Replacements.    I thought about The Strokes, Foo Fighters (was Dave Grohl the genius behind Nirvana?  I'm starting to wonder - no disrespect to Kurt C.) and The White Stripes, but they are a bit too new and until they emerge from the category of artists with two or three really great albums (Soul Coughing and Cake are in this happy place), they will not rank as the greatest.  They have potential though...  I also am not terribly studied on The Flaming Lips, but I like everything that I have heard - how do you start with a discography that long?  You have to give them props for longevity and for being from Oklahoma (quick, name something better to come out of Oklahoma...that's what I thought).    Many people like Steely Dan, Bon Jovi and Van Halen, but I'm not there.    So, the Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time is Wilco.    Think about it. From  AM  to  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , to their collaboration with Billy Bragg on the Woody Guthrie songs, to their collaboration with Minus 5 last year, everything they touch turns to pure art.  When was the last time you listened to  Being There ?  Have you ever seen them live at First Ave?  Ohmigod they ROCK!!!  Also, they never sold out, and they challenge their listeners and take their music and all of music in new directions without really changing who they are.  They pretty much started the Alt Country subgenre.  Their lyrics?  Sublime.  Their sound?  Immediately indentifiable as Wilco.  For this reason, I am nominating Wilco as the Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time.  When I think of American rock and roll, I think of Wilco.  Do you disagree?  Here are the rules for disagreeing:  1.  You must pick a band.  No solo artists. 2.  It must be all American.  Friends, Led Zeppelin was a British band. 3.  They must be a Rock and Roll Band (or else I would have included De la Soul and the Beastie Boys and Parliament).  You will arrive at the same answer I did:  Wilco. Wilco.         "
"            Angels in America  By Duf 'Art Lover' Fer  If you have a chance, I urge you, nayI plead with yousee  urlLink this movie .  I saw the play(s) when it (they) was (were) in Minneapolis several years ago.  This version was on HBO, and I watched it on a video tape that my in-laws lent me.  It is six hours long, so I would encourage you to take it in installments.  Still, this play (these plays), this movie (these movies)are art.  Kushner won a Pulitzer for the plays, and you can see why:  they are art, pure art.  The conversations about religion, sexuality, race, patriotism, sickness, convalescence, history, politics, conservatism, liberalism, addiction, parenthood, marriage, divorce (togetherness, separation), mortality, immortality, gain and loss, freedom and slavery are simply amazing.  There are moments when it becomes a bit too arty and perhaps too literary (if thats possible), but it succeeds on so many levels that you are left slack-jawed and amazed.  As I watched it, I kept thinking I cant believe one person wrote this.  The writing is so rich (maybe too rich sometimes) that you imagine some of the ideas were a lifetime in the making.  The acting:  Emma Thompson is great.  Al Pacino is magnificenthas Meryl Streep ever done a poor acting job?  Ive never seen it.  But the show was stolen (stop, thief!) by Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat) who has to be among our nations best actors.   Art lovers, see this film!

Also, they weren't even that good looking...don't know what all the hype was about.   urlLink He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not , 2002 - 4.5 stars So damn clever, and with Audrey Tautou you can't go wrong with the cuteness factor.  A different side of her here, though.    urlLink Little Voice , 1998 - 4 stars Jane Horrocks of  urlLink AbFab fame  - the girl can sing EXACTLY like Judy Garland.

Great cast.    urlLink She's the One , 1996 - 3.5 stars A good sequel to The Brothers McMullen.  Some sub-par acting and predictability made me rate it a little lower.  But Eddie Burns is in it and he's hot, so...    urlLink The Opposite of Sex , 1998 - 3 stars  Lisa Kudrow is great, but I couldn't really get into this film.  It didn't seem to be leading anywhere (not that each film should, but it felt like this one wanted to...does that make sense?).  Forgettable.   urlLink Beyond Borders , 2003 - 3.5 stars  I am surprised I haven't heard more people talk about this film.  It has an importance, but only if you look past the Hollywood-ness of the cheesy love story.  What fascinated me was that it was filmed on 3 continents with a limited budget and they did not try to make the poverty look pretty.  When Angelina Jolie's character was in Africa, she held a boy who was truly starving to death.   urlLink Devil's Playground , 2002 - 4 stars  OK, don't laugh.  This is a documentary about the Amish.  For some reason, I am so curious about this culture - this film highlights the time in a young Amish person's life where he/she must decide whether to embrace or leave the church.  Excellent.   urlLink Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , 1988 - 3.5 stars  I liked the last Almodovar film I saw (Talk to Her) so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It's hysterically Spanish and Antonio Banderas is young and squeaky clean!   urlLink Tom & Viv , 1994 - 3 stars I'm a fan of TS Eliot, but not a huge fan of this movie.  It was extremely difficult for me to watch.    urlLink Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! , 2004 - 3 stars  Don't hate...I had to throw a teen romance in here  somewhere .  Plus, I love Topher Grace from That 70's Show.  He's so my type.   urlLink All About My Mother , 1999 - 3.5 stars  Yep, you guessed it...another one from Almodovar (no, he doesn't make every successful Spanish film).  What do you want - transvestites, love, death, birth?...you get it all here.   urlLink The Ring , 2002 - 3.5 stars Freaked me out.  Is still freaking me out.  It's freaky....although, when I found out it's a remake from a Japanese horror flic, it didn't seem quite so scary anymore.   urlLink Casa de los Babys , 2003 - 3 stars Terrific cast, but too many characters (or too little time?) to develop even one of them appropriately.      urlLink Italian for Beginners , 2000 - 4 stars Ever hear of  urlLink Dogme 95 ?  This was Lone Scherfig's first attempt at this rather pompous way of filmmaking.   Dancer in the Dark  also attempted to adhere to the Dogme 95 manifesto, but is considered 'Dogme lite' because of some 'cheating' - it's use of music, the director's mention in the credits, etc.   Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself  is out now, and, from what I've heard from interviews, Scherfig was happy to go to the opposite side of Dogme.  She described it as going up to a buffet line and being able to eat all you want again.  Filmmaking aside, IFB is a touching story about friends and relationships - and it's Danish!  It's amazing when you take the unnatural beauty away from a film, how easier it is to just focus on the characters.    urlLink Ma Vie En Rose , 1997 - 4 stars  So sweet.  And so heart-wrenching.   urlLink L.I.E. , 2001- 3.5 stars  Difficult and disturbing subject matter - not for the faint of heart.   urlLink Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her , 2000 - 3 stars  I didn't love or hate this movie.  It was blah.   urlLink I Capture the Castle , 2003 - 3.5 stars  There is no action, no suspense, and it's a little contrived at times. It is, nonetheless, an absorbing and enchanting film.   urlLink Love Liza , 2002 - 3 stars So, so, so depressing.  Perfect part for Philip Seymour Hoffman who always seems so defeated anyway.

"           To keep my mind from wandering (into a black hole of despair) I've been distracting myself by planning some fun into my life.  What's on the schedule?  Let me tell you...   This weekend:  1 day @ Great America + 1 day of skydiving = one dangerous weekend.  I've been skydiving before, so I may just take pictures in the cockpit while my crazy bro and sis-in-law jump to their deaths.  I like taking photos, you know.   June:  Hal and I are flying to Hot-lanta to see our very own Bassy.  We're going to spend a couple days in Savannah (pool or sea-side) and it will be a kick-ass time, I'm sure.  Plus, it's going to be cheap which you can't beat.   Labor Day weekend:  going to London - for FREE (staying with my friend Ian and using miles)!!  We'll also take a detour to Paris for a day or two.  Owwww!  Back to work.         "
"            Bat Mitzvah :  I had a really cool weekend.  I went to my friend Sarah's Bat Mitzvah, and it was deeply moving and very beautiful.  The synagogue really embraced her as an adult member, and her parents and others joined in saying really great things about her.  I have thought about it over and over since I was there.  Two thoughts continue:  everyone should be celebrated that way at least once in their life (and when better than at age 13), and it was amazing to see Sarah carry the Torah around the congregation to receive mazaltov from friends and family.   Cultural Reviews :  I also saw 'American Splendor' which is a wonderful film.  Highly recommended.  All the actors do a great job, and it was just a very creative presentation of a wonderful story.  Karen liked it too. Four stars (out of five).  We also saw 'The Cooler.'  I thought it was uneven, but, for the most part, well done. What the hell, see it.  Three stars.  We also saw 'Something's Gotta Give' with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.  I did not care for it. The script was horrible, and while I appreciate the 'bravery' Keaton exhibited in 2 seconds of nudity, I thought she did a horrible job and turned in a thoroughly unbelievable performance.  I cannot believe she was nominated for this work.  It stuns me when I think about it.  One half star.  The artistic hit of the weekend, for me, was the new Morrissey album, 'You are the Quarry.'  The first three tracks, 'America is Not the World' 'Irish Blood English Heart,' and 'I Have Forgiven Jesus' are sublime, and the rest of the disc does not disappoint.  If you don't like Morrissey, this disc will not convert you, but if you come to it as a fan (or with no preconceived notions), my prediction is that you will be favorably impressed.  The opening track is a wonderful love song to America (that is also, like all true love songs, lovingly honest and somewhat biting).  'Irish Blood, English Heart' is the high point of the disc.  So much conflict, so much honesty.  It's amazing.  Track three rocks.  It is Morrissey forgiving Jesus for making him gay in a world that will not allow him to express his love.  Amazingly beautiful.  This disc is Morrissey in a microcosm.  'I Like You' is also a great song.  You laugh because, on the surface it seems maudlin, but as you let it works its magic, you realize that songs have a depth and candor that is rarely seen and that Morrissey is amazing if only for his refusal to change from being who he is even as he knows that most of the world is not ready for him.  Anyway, the album, its production, its music, its lyrics, and the whole package are just very darn good.  Five stars.     Work :  We packed more boxes and prepared to move (coming this Friday).         "

"            Here's the Skinny   As a couple of you know, I never received a letter from the BU.  So I thought I'd send him a Dear John letter, telling him, basically, we're through.  I sent it (via e-mail, no screwing around here) yesterday.  He responded with a heartfelt note saying how he was so sorry for his recent behavior and how I was still special to him, and he knows he has trouble expressing his emotions, yadda, yadda, yadda.  I thought what he said was all very nice, and at one point I actually thought to myself 'maybe I've been too hard on him'.  But then at the end of his little note he asked if he could call me on Sunday.  I responded with something like: 'Sure, call me, but why wait until Sunday?'  'Because I'm busy every night until then.'  Oh, I see.  'Don't you see I'm STILL not a priority to you?'  'I can try calling you tonight...'  To which I responded (as an ode to DJS, these are my exact words, no lie): 'Can't.  Busy.'  Finally, I just picked up the phone because I thought 'How dumb is it that we're having this lame convo via e-mail.'  PB: What is it that you have to say to me? BU:  I wanted to see how you were doing.  PB: Ah, isn't that  apparent ??  So what you're saying is, you want to call me so  you  feel better?  Hmmm, selfish again. BU:  I'm not meaning to be selfish.  PB: No, BU, you never have.  How very sad.  When I broke up with someone exactly a year ago, he had some surprisingly wise words to say at the time:  'Unfortunately there's never a good way for these things to end...just varying degrees of bad.  If we were able to see how they'd end, though, I suppose we'd never bother to give them a try in the first place.'  True that.          "

"            459 Pictures...About 5 of Them Worth A Damn   You know how at weddings they have those little cameras that encourage people to take pictures and such?  Well, we had 'em at our wedding and we went and picked up the photos yesterday from Target.  Now, I'm not saying I'm a pro photographer or anything, but holy jumped-up bald-headed Jesus Christ...people do not know how to take pictures.  Sure there were a few that were pretty decent.  There even happens to be one with 4/5 of the Pandyland Crew that turned out all right...but for the most part?  Absolute shit.  Examples:  - Here's one with DJ LZ's mom in the lower left hand corner looking off into space.  The rest of the picture?  Black. - Ah yes.  The famous split-shot technique.  This happens from not advancing the film completely before snapping another shot.  One half has my uncle's crotch, the other half?  A big spud nose that I don't recognize. - Oh...what's that black blurry number?  That's right.  Someone didn't think it necessary to use the flash...IN A DARK ROOM.  Crazy Kodak.  When will they get it right? - Or there's the DJ LZ's Friend Show, in which every single photograph on the camera was of her friend in the purple shirt.  Hey, that's great.  Now we've got a whole album's worth of pictures featuring her goofy mug. - Oh, cool.  Looks like someone got a picture of everyone jamming on the dance floor.  Wait never mind.  They shot the picture directly in the back of someone who was standing by watching.  Of course, even if it was an accident, you think they'd try again.  Nope.  Can't.  Busy.  Okay, I realize I sound bitter, but I don't mean to be.  It's just I guess we were expecting some sort of composition or consistency in the pictures.  Yeah, they're throw-away cameras in the hands of mostly-intoxicated people, but still...it was kind of a disappointment.  $110.00 to develop the pictures and they were pretty bad.  Let's just hope the real photographers took some decent shots, eh?  Or even the shots off of the PandyCam?         "
"            Exactly a year ago today...   I experienced the same exact relationship woes as I am experiencing now.  I thought a repeat of my post from May 6, 2003 would be appropriate.    Keep On Truckin': Why Not to Waste Your Energy on People Who Suck     Some people are energy vampires. When you are with them or after you depart, you feel drained or depressed. They are emotionally insatiable; no matter how much attention or time you give them, there is always one more thing they need. If you try to help them feel better, they resist and argue for their problems. They don't recognize their ability to generate joy, love, or prosperity for themselves, so they look to others to sustain them. Watch out for anyone who says, 'I have so much love to give and no one to give it to.' Immediately translate that into, 'I am the emotional black hole of the universe, and I will suck every ounce of life force from you if you let me.'

'I love my brother and now that DJ LZ and he are married, I guess I love her too.'    Lowlights:   - My little cousin that wouldn't well...just leave me the $%$& alone!

"           Dear Mary,  I don't envy you.  You are either compelled by love of your father or hatred of yourself to act against yourself.  You are denying yourself to support your father (or worse to make a big salary).  I cannot imagine what it would be like to suppress who I am in order to maintain the approval of my father, and I won't even try to imagine what kind of father would ask a child to do that.  I wish for you that your father would love you for who you are, that he would support you as you, and that he would recognize the impact of his policies on his family and on families all over America.  I am an African American, and I am married to a white woman. To understand what you are doing, I imagine that my mother is the Vice-President, and that she was advocating for the return of anti-miscegenation laws.  I can tell you that if that happened, not only would I not support my mother's campaign (how could I?  To do it would be self-hatred, and it would be an acknowledgement that the love I feel for my wife is wrong), but I would work for her enlightenment.  If that failed, then I would work for her opponent, and I would be public about it.  Feel free to use my strategy if you want to do so.  Im sure that John Kerry could meet your salary expectations.  The big flaw in your approach is that you are not just denying yourself, you are denying others.  It would be one thing if you made the choice to deny yourself in order to maintain peace at home, but in supporting your father, you are furthering an agenda that is aggressively anti-you and therefore detrimental to those gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with whom you share community.   I wish for you clarity and conversion.  I wish that your father would discontinue his hypocrisy (he cant love you and hate you at the same time  he cant love you privately and hate you publicly either  to love you, he must love you for who you are and he must do so in all settings), and I wish that, as you channeled your energy into supporting your father, you would work twice as hard to get him to provide for you the full blessings and rights to which you are entitled as a human being.

"           Either he's really perceptive or I'm really obvious.  This just in from The Dentist:   I really enjoy being with you.  I would enjoy being with you this week some more, but if your schedule is too busy I understand.  I'll wait to hear from you next week.  If, however, this is a round-about way of telling me you are not interested, I won't call or e-mail and be a nuisance.  I apologize if that isn't the case, but it seems becoming 'busy', particularly after a second date, is a favorite way for women to give me that hint.  If it is all the same, I hope I am wrong about that.   It kills me that I find absolutely no spark with this guy considering he could give me everything I ever wanted (houses, cars, stay at home with the kids...the works).  I can't bring myself to do it...as much as I try, I'm no gold-digger.  I'm all about planning certain things in life, but this guy is on a relentless wife hunt and actually told me he couldn't date a woman 35 or older because she would be too old to bear his children. ('You know...date a year, get married, no kids for a year, and by that time she'll be 38 and this decreases my chances of ever having kids.')  The irony in this whole method of thinking would be if HE had slow swimmers.         "
"           In a binge purchasing extravaganza two weeks ago, I went into Best Buy naked and walked out cloaked in PJ Harvey, Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys.  As I was working my way through each one, I realized it was like visiting with old friends who just came back to town (with a nod to Panda) all the while sneaking some time in with your new best friend (Modest Mouse).    All three discs are immediately recognizable as attributable to the artists who produce them.  PJ sounds like PJ, Sonic Youth sounds like Sonic Youth, and the Beastie Boys haven't changed since they decided to stop fighting for their right to party (not strictly true, Pauls Boutique is very different from Check Your Head, right?).   The PJ Harvey disc, Uh Huh Her, is fine and dandy until Track 5 when it suddenly decides to get really, really awesome.  My God I want to sleep with her (have you seen the picture in Entertainment Weekly?  It is very, very compelling to a certain mindset which apparently I must have).  Polly Jean just seems so mean and damaged which (for some damn reason) is right up my alley (Mrs. Duf notwithstanding).  But I digress...Track 5, 'Letter', may be my song of the summer (which is different from my song of the year which will undoubtedly come from the Modest Mouse CD 'Good News for People Who Love Bad News.'  Early favorites are: The World at Large and One Chance) it is just amazing.    If you like Sonic Youth, you will like their new album, 'Sonic Nurse.'  If you don't, then you really won't.  I like Sonic Youth.  Sometimes I love them.  My biggest problem with Sonic Youth is that I am totally in love with Kim Gordon, and I love them so much more when she is singing lead (which is about 50% of the time).  Still, the album is very solid, and to me, represents the best of Sonic Youth  which is to say a strict adherence to making the kind of music they want to make and (as near as I can tell) for doing it in a vacuum.  I know of no other artists who eschew accessibility and popular appeal as drivers for their art more than Sonic Youth.  Their album Goo (fear of a female planet, fear baby) was probably the closest they will ever come to radio play and its not that they dont care, its more that they dont consider it.  Best song:  Dripping Dream.  God I want to sleep with Kim Gordon.  Do any of you know her?  I do not have a crush on any of the Beastie Boys.  I suppose Adam Yauch comes the closest to my style, but I dont swing that way (with nothing but love in my heart for our brothers and sisters who do).  But I digressthe Beastie Boys album 'To the Five Burroughs' is clean. Ch-Check It Out, yall. There are some rhymes that miss, but that is the risk them Boys take for rhymes that are just plain fierce.  They have an anti-Bush song that I respond to politically, but not musically or lyrically, and there are some misses on the disc (it is hard to rap about post 9/11 New York apparently), but overall, the joy that is apparent as they ply their craft, the intelligence and maturity behind the rhyme, the old skool homage (Ruinite on ice references? E.F. Hutton references?  C'mon that's fresh y'all), and the background beats and bass and sampling is so worth the trip, that when the ride is over, all you remember is the good times.   Just like when an old friend visits after a long time away, right?          "
"           So, my little brother just got from Hong Kong yesterday.  This morning, I got an e-mail from him with 'SARS' in the subject line.  Knowing how funny I think SARS is, I opened it like a fat kid opening his fifteenth candy bar.  Inside was a message that said: 'Check out these pics of me in Hong Kong.'     Maybe I'm a sick bastard, but I think this is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  There was another picture (in a different location) where he's doing the same thing.  Yep.

"           This morning my daughter, TinyE, woke me up by pulling my hair.  It occurred to me that I should not have enough hair to pull.    For BB and Panda, who have not seen me VERY recently, my afro is out of control. I swear to all that is holy that I was going to get a haircut last week, but my stylist was out of town for vacation.  I even tried to go to a barbershop in (gulp) St. Paul (on Selby Avenue no less), but it closed five minutes before I got there.  My daughter's teacher has commented on my hair twice.  I actually try to pack it down before I enter elevators so as not to scare the other passengers.  But it's no use...my 'fro just grow and grow. This week has been the week from hell at work, and I literally cannot sneak away for a trim.  But, today (good Lord willing and the creek don't rise) my last meeting ends at 4:00 at which time I will race to Dinkytown for a much needed bone fade (down to the scalp, ya heard me?).    Until then, right on soul brothers and sisters, and remember, Black is Beautiful.         "
"           OK, here's the thing.  I can't say I liked this movie (critics be damned) although I do admit to liking the message and getting a good laugh.  Michael Moore takes risks.  Michael Moore is over-the-top.  Michael Moore is unabashedly biased, unsubtle, and hates G-Dub with all his heart.  Michael Moore has been blessed with the release of his film being impeccably timed.  He has also been blessed with getting his hands on some amazing live footage of the president, soldiers, and other politicians doing and saying some stupid, stupid things.  However, Michael Moore is not the greatest film-maker to ever live.  This is a film about a man who hates the current administration.  He is not offering solutions to the problem (i.e. - who would make a good replacement).  He is not apologizing for taking things out of context.  He is merely presenting his stream-of-consciousness ideologies.  Good ol' Mikey lost the focus in Fahrenheit 9/11 that he had captured in Bowling for Columbine.  He presents footage in a way that does not flow smoothly, and  IMHO, the film is at least 15 minutes too long.  If it wasn't for the comical music and his dubbed-over voice, I would have become bored during some parts.  I do recommend everyone (except for my father, a Vietnam veteran) go see it, but bring a barrel of salt with you.   ps - If I would have written a real review, it would have sounded something like  urlLink this .

"           Of course it was great, because it started out with The Darkness.     What was good:  Justin Hawkins' jump suits, lil' DJS knowing all the words, the eclectic crowd, and enjoying some beverages after the show (thanks, friends, for keeping it all on the DL).   What was bad:  the opening band (sorry...me no likey), the acoustics (thank God for earplugs), and the fact that my stupid ass was in the bathroom when Justin got up on someone's shoulders and played his guitar through the crowd.  F-me.  I ended up having a date on Saturday night: dinner/drinks on a roof-top patio and riding his motorcycle around the lakes.  It truly felt like summer.  Since I was concerned about him driving his motorcycle back in the middle of the night (and at bar time, no less), I let him sleep on my couch.  The dilemma there was: how do I get him out the next morning since The Dentist was coming to get me for brunch?  I told myself I'd be honest with each of these guys throughout this whole process.  But I couldn't bring myself to tell him why he needed to be out by 8am on Sunday.  So I lied.   'I'm going to church.'   Let's hope the God I believe in is a forgiving God, otherwise I'll see y'all in hell.         "
"           I thought it would be funny if I put a picture up of me with the Oscar Mayer wienermobile. Big mistake.  I've been getting an assortment of responses because of it, the most recent being:   'You want to see a REAL Wiener?'   Thanks, but no thanks.         "
"           Just to clear things up:   The Cuddler  = the guy who has his fingers on his mouth in his picture, aka 'cuddlingryan', aka 'are you still interested?'   Drama Queen (DQ)  = the guy who's coming to the show tonight.  I've seen him the most, but mostly because he asks me out the most and bugs me a lot.  But he likes cool music, so I'm trying to deal.   The Dentist  = if any guy is going to 'rise to the top' so to speak at this point, this one seems like he has that potential.  He's got his stuff together, and he helped me put on my coat last night.  Plus, I gotta get DJS invisalign.   The Pilot  = the guy with the fake photo below who is too incredibly well-rounded to be for real.  We may go out for a drink next week.   Apple Guy  = works for Apple computers.  He's probably e-mailed me about 10 times or so...I'm sorry, ask me out already, otherwise I don't have time to e-mail you anymore.  can't. busy.   U2 Fan  = in my profile title, I make a kind of obscure reference to my favorite band.  This guy is the only one who got it.  We've e-mailed, but that's about it.  There are a myriad of others, but I don't feel like typing anymore...plus, I have a stupid meeting I have to get to.  Hope that helps.         "

"           I needed to post before this site became 'all Panda, all the time'. :)  Georgia was great fun, though not as low-brow as Panda makes it sound.  We got a Styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it, reflecting our deep love of country.  We gladly held the elevator door for fellow hotel guests, certainly preventing unnecessary death/decapitate - it was a very angry door.  And we spent Sunday morning checking out the proud historical sites of Savannah.    Upon returning, I went to  urlLink The Streets  show at the Fine Line on Monday night (along with Panda and Markie-Marc).  It was a good show... amplified by Marc's massive enthusiasm.  Incidentally, I picked up the  urlLink second 'Streets' album  whilst at the show... I am LOVING it -  A Grand Don't Come For Free .  I thought the first album was fun, but the latest kicks ass.  It's a 'concept album', a phrase which instantly turned me off - 'concept album' being a pseudonym for 'indulgent crap music'.  But this is cool - the whole album tells a linear story that takes place (one assumes) over the course of several weeks/months.  Each song stands on it's own, but reference situations in other songs.  Plus, it's odd to hear such a heartfelt love song such as 'Dry Your Eyes' from a young, cocky, drug-fueled rapper (though I think he's better described as a 'spoken-worder').  Tomorrow night is  urlLink The Darkness .  Can't wait.         "

"           I think I may wait a day or 2 to respond, but next week should be real interesting.   Hello,  Yes, I live in Stillwater, and yes I go to Minneapolis all the time. I work in Plymouth, so I pass through it every day to and from the office. I also like going out downtown with friends to clubs, restaurants and sporting events.  Maybe we could get together for a drink after work next week.   Let me know,  Jeremy   It's amusing how he makes a point to let me know he's soooo well rounded.  Oh, and I'm supposed to go out with a dentist tonight.  Anyone need a teeth cleaning or bleaching?           "
"           Remember 'cuddlingryan' (refer to Friday, June 11th archives)??  Well, I just heard from him again.  All he said in his note was:    Are you still interested?  Ryan    Translation: I'm bored with these other hussies I've been meeting, how 'bout it?   So, in order to stay true to my mission here, I told him 'Why not?'.  The sacrifices I make for you people.  Egad.          "
"           he already responded!   Hello,  Funny you should ask what my favorite destination is because you just moved back from there. Yep, the windy city tops the list in my book, well, Wrigley field to be exact. I'm a huge Cubs fan. I used to live in Schaumburg, IL. for about two and a half years from 1995 to 1998. I was a restaurant manager for the Rainforest Cafe at the Woodfield Mall. Like yourself, I moved back because I missed Minnesota, my friends, family and the great camping, boating, downhill skiing, state parks, waterways and trails here. I'm a huge outdoorsman and do a lot of camping, hiking, and backpacking as well as running the trails at Taylors Falls and hanging out on the St. Croix river near my house. I loved Chicago for the entertainment and night-life, but it has nothing to offer in the way of esthetics; it's really not a very pretty state. There are no hiking trails, forests, downhill skiing hills, and little water besides lake Michigan there either. I think it's a great place to visit, and I try to get back there a few times a year, but I don't think I would never live there again, unless I could live accross the street from Wrigley!  Anyhow, I also like to travel to Hawaii, Mexico and Colorado and have been to each of them three or four times.  I really like your profile and it looks like we have a few things in common. Would you be interested in meeting sometime? Maybe we could get together for a drink after work sometime.  Talk to you soon,  Jeremy   So I told him I'd be up for that.  My coworker let me know that if we ended up meeting, she'd hide out at the bar with a camera to get his dirty mug on film.  Hoo-ha!          "
"           Like this guy:   'Pilot seeks copilot'       I am new to this whole internet dating thing, but it seems like the only decent way to meet people at my age. I am extremely active and enjoy boating, downhill skiing, motorcycling, rock climbing, kayaking, bicycling, lifting weights, running, playing softball, basketball and golf. I own a house near the St. Croix river, but I'm rarely home as I travel often and spend most of my time outdoors in the summer, either out boating or just hanging out by my pool.  My friends would describe me as an outgoing, athletic, hard-working, driven, succesful, loyal, grateful, generous, educated, fun-loving guy who takes nothing for granted.  I am looking for a girl who likes to have fun, doesn't take life too seriously and is not stressed out. Life should be fun, and you should love to laugh, travel and just enjoy all that life has to offer.    But what is even more unbelievable than his profile is his picture.  Where did he get that chach shot, from the Sears catalog?  Sheesh!  I just got a note from him - should I reply?  Any suggestions?         "
"           Bad news for you Lollapalooza ticket holders.   urlLink Cancelled!!!          "
"           Wow - we had a great time.  But I have to say, put the three of us together (Bassy, Hal, and yours truly) and it will lead to sick, sick behavior.  I always knew I had the inclination to take situations/conversations to the limit, but Hal and Bassy sure gave me a run for my money.  Our talks turned filthy, vulgar, inappropriate, uncouth, and downright smutty.  We also really enjoyed the Waffle House and the Huddle House restaurants.  Grits, anyone?  Here are a few examples of our obscene conduct:  1) Before we went out one evening in Savannah, Hal was hanging out on our hotel porch (second floor, overlooking the pool) for a while by herself (with a cocktail, of course).  After a half hour I went out there to see what was happening: 'What are you doing out here?'  Hal: 'Oh, I've just been watching that dry-humping couple in the pool.'  Believe me, we couldn't stop staring - it was foul, and there were young children nearby.  The term 'dry humping' later became the theme phrase for the rest of the trip.  2) After it gets to a heat index of about 110, one may find it difficult to describe that kind of heat (especially while sitting on the beach with no umbrella).  But I somehow found a way to explain it just right: 'It's hotter than a sweaty ballsack after a long run.'  Now, I don't actually  have  a ballsack or anything, so I could be wrong.  3) We found a great sign at a gas station in Dublin, GA: 'Wash and Lube: Enter in Rear'.  That got at least a half hour of hearty chortles, especially after Hal took a picture of me in front of it, with my back to the camera.  4) Our beloved Bassy met a fella (at a place called 'The Bar Bar' - huh?) and on our drive home something happened in the backseat of her Mazda that is too risqu to even describe here.  :)  However, that incident was perfect for us to bring up the term 'dry humping' again.  5) We watched Zoolander before we went out one night and I was dared to go up to a guy and say 'You can dere-lick my balls cap-i-tan.'  I chickened out.  And we also couldn't get Bassy to holler 'The South will rise again!' (in a thick Southern accent) - even through that would have been completely appropriate during her backseat escapade.  It was fun and laughter for 3-1/2 days straight.  Thanks, girls.         "
"           I just got a note from a couple creeps.  It's interesting to figure out how to translate these things after you've seen a few of them.  Title of his profile: 'Attractive guy wanting attractive girl!!'   Translation: shallow   User Name: 'athleticbusyman'   Translation: only wants to have fun; no commitments   Marital Status: 'separated'  Translation: I'm cheating on my wife.   No Photo listed.  Translation: I don't want my friends and/or wife to see I'm using this to get chicks on the side.   Profile: 'I'm looking for a fun, attractive, and fit girl who is looking to have a good time and not looking to force something to happen. My ideal date would be to hit it off with a girl who has a mutual attraction to me, while not leting her shyness stand in the way of something great. A physically intense relationship is ideal, so please don't be affraid to e-mail me if you like to rattle the headboard from time to time. I'm an honest, good-looking, nice guy,(not a sick-o), and hope that you don't pass me up. I'm pretty sure I'm worth the effort. I look forward to talking to you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!'   Translation: None needed...it's obvious he's a perv. (physically intense? keep on truckin'.)   A different guy's profile: 'I'm a nice guy, so deal with it! Your going to have to accept me the way I am! lol! I just can't be mean to women! Not in me! I like to treat them like a lady, not dirt! I have 2 kids, 1 by my ex and 1 by a previous relationship, so yes I have some drama in my life but nothing I can't handle! I love my kids and am not willing to move far from this area. I like going to movies(sappy and romantic is good with me!) dance(slowly so I can hold you close), play pool(I'll teach you if you want me to), sing karaoke(not always in tune but much better than some drunks that get up there and do it!), and most of all, I love to snuggle! I'm a teddy bear made of cushion on top, and steel underneath(ask me about that). If you are interested, please respond to my ad!  My ideal match? hmmmm.... I guess she should have a heart and a pulse! lol! But truly, no control freaks! It's a major peeve of mine! Neither one of us should be in control, we should be equal partners and be rule our kingdom together. I love a woman whom can dish out compliments as well as receive them, not deny them and tell me they don't deserve what I'm saying,that's a peeve of mine as well. She should be confident in the way she looks, whether she's overweight, too tall, or whatever, I am a man of internal values, it's what's inside that counts, the outside is just the shell of your soul. So show me what your made of!'   Translation: Too many exclamation points = trying too hard.  If a guy uses the acronym 'lol' -especially more than once- no thanks.  And we found ourselves yet another snuggler, but at least he has low expectations (a heart and a pulse??).   Snugglers and cuddlers abound on these sites.  That is the one thing that I'm sure of.           "

"           Without going into too much detail, here's the breakdown of my Friday night date-o-rama:  1) We did a little bar hopping: Uptown Bar & Grill, Figlio's happy hour (choice), and Bilimbi Bay for a view and a margarita.    2) Along the way we also stopped at Tonic - since there wasn't a line, we went in.  When we found out there was a cover, we turned around to leave, and ran into Lee Jeans and friends.  In an awkward moment, I hugged Lee and his buddies and then introduced them all to my date.  First dates are stressful enough, even without running into ex-boyfriends.  3) On the drive home, my date expressed a desire to go to the bathroom.  I suggested we pull over by Lake Harriet...hey, I could care less and it was dark enough.  Unfortunately, it was a little too dark, and he ended up almost taking a swim - he fell into the lake up to his knees.  Hilarity ensued.  4) We went out again on Sunday.    Not sure what to do with the others who have expressed interest, but this guy seems to be a-ok.  Despite my preconceived notions of meeting some real clowns, I seem to be enjoying myself.  As an interesting side note, a friend of mine in Chicago ran into stupid ol' Randy yesterday, and boy did she let him have it.  It's great to have good friends who will rail your ex-boyfriends for you. :)          "
"           I just got an e-mail out of the blue from a guy who calls himself 'cuddlingryan'.  I have never e-mailed this guy before, so I was quite shocked to read he already wanted to take me out.  Ya think he wants some skin?  Um, yeah.   I love your profile! If you would be interested I would like to take you out sometime. I'm romantic, athletic, and love to cuddle, not to mention give great back massages! Well hope to hear from you soon!     Ryan oxoxoxo   What's with all the xoxoxoxo's??  And it sounds like he  really  likes to cuddle (aka get women in the sack) considering he can't stop talking about it.

"           The date's tonight.  We might just have cocktails and/or head to a rock show.  Funny piece of trivia: he was at the Jayhawks show that a few of us went to in December.  Anyway, I'm actually kind of excited...this is a very strange world I've entered into.  I've also been 'talking' to some other fellas...one in particular who works for Apple.  Perhaps he can get me a deal on the computer I've been dying to have?  Deets next week.  Over and out.          "
"           I am growing a beard.  It will meet its premature end on Sunday night.  I like beards.  Left to my own devices, I would have one all the time.  Why? Because I like them.  Also, they are much easy than shaving, and I don't have to worry about ingrown hairs, razor burn, etc.  I also think that I look a wee bit better with a beard than without.  That's just my opinion.    Beards are not doing well in America these days.  It has been the case for a long time.  Mustaches are fine.  Goatees are de riguer, but beards for some reason are not favored.  I don't know if it is because of a tie to fundamentalists, or mountain men, or what.  I do know that the company I work for has a policy against beards.  This always amazes me.  No other hair policy exists.  Theoretically, I could come in sportin' braids, but I should shave.  I could dye my hair blond, but I better come in with a hairless chin.    My boss is not much for beards either.  I could tell by the way he looked at me when he first saw me this week.    Mrs. Duf hates a beard with the best of them.  Which is, of course, encouragement in the other direction.    I once saw a 60 minutes piece where Ed Bradley was profiled in an airport because he bought a ticket the day of a flight, was black, paid cash and...that's right...had a beard.    It just seems odd to me that multiple Presidents have had beards.  Jesus had a beard, and so did the entire Allman Brothers band.  Yet for some reason, they are frowned upon.  So here's my plan: as soon as I retire, I'm growing it out.  Big, bad and beautiful.  Just like nature intended.           "
"           Our little Panda is going on a date.  What a difference 24-hours makes.  I've had several clowns contact me (one of them had a picture of himself with a hockey jersey on giving the thumbs-up...it was hard to see, but I think his teeth were yellow), but there have also been a few gems in the rough.  One of them just asked me out, and since he used the word 'libations' in a sentence, I might just have to go out with him.     'Perhaps we should get together and pontificate over the merits of our lovely metropolitan area here, or maybe even to enjoy one of the interesting local shows along with the requisite libations and such?'   How could I say no?  And to make it interesting, I may have to get back to yellow-teeth guy too.  You know, just to mix it up.  Wouldn't want to let my readers down and all...           "
"           No, this isn't another link to something Jesus related.    I'm just thinking it's high time we put together another Pandyland Burrito Jamboree.  I mean, what's the deal?  Panda has been back in town for months and we can't seem to put anything together.  I think we need High Life (okay, maybe just me), karoake, and a dirty, filthy bar.  Who's with me?  Oh, I guess 4/5 of us are going to see these guys in a couple o' weeks:     You know...I really do believe in a thing called love.  Don't believe me?  Just listen to the rhythm of my heart.         "
"           Sometimes I think the moment I become single, 'I AM SINGLE' is immediately emblazoned on my forehead for only assholes to see.  I was out with my charming lesbian friends on Friday, making me the token single hetero woman in our group for the weirdo guys on the prowl to talk to.  It was like flies on shit.  Asshole: Do you mind that I smoke? Me: If you're asking whether or not I think it's gross, I think it's gross. Asshole: But honey, don't worry.  I won't smoke while we're in bed!  Heaven help me.

"           When I was in high school, I had the great good fortune to be among a group of 100 young men who participated in a mock government program in Washington D.C.  As part of our week in Washington, we laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and we saw one of those precision military rifle groups. The high point of the week was a visit to the White house where we met Reagan in the rose garden.  I spent the early part of the visit day waiting to see him so that I could pound him with difficult questions and prove that he was an empty suit.  'Mr. President, you claimed that ketchup is a vegetable...'  'Mr. President, you indicated that there is no homelessness in America, I wonder if you would accompany me...'  'As regards your Star Wars missle defense system, Mr. President...'  We got to the White House, made it through elaborate security, and waited for him in the rose garden where I had the best lemonade I have ever had in my entire life.  He finally came up, and I walked toward him to ask a question.  When I got there, he shook my hand, looked me in the eye with those piercing blues (by the way, he smelled great, and had the broadest shoulders I have yet seen) and started telling a story about young men and horses (I missed his point).  There are few men that I disagree with more than I disagreed with Reagan, but I have never met a more charismatic man in my entire life.  I walked in wanting to slay him with my rage, and, had he asked me, I would have campaigned for him that afternoon (within a few days, I reverted to form, but still).  I will never forget that meeting.   The new Modest Mouse CD 'Good News for People Who Like Bad News' is out.  It comes recommended to me by my friend Brian B., of Columbus, Ohio.  I have only given a few preliminary listens, and I will promise a full review later, but I can tell you, it has potential to be my album of the year.  A little Wilco, a little Flaming Lips, a little Frank Black.  I particularly admire track two:  'The World at Large.'  I went to Perkins for lunch.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich to go.  The good people at Perkins were kind enough to include a little cup of cole slaw.  It was great. I know there are some haters in the land, but for my money, cole slaw is the best possible presentation of cabbage.             "
"           I think we need to add a little more spice/interest to the site.  Or maybe I'm just bored.  Regardless, I have a proposition to make.  I thought about joining Match.com.  Not to meet 'that special someone', but to go on (mostly horrendous, I presume) dates, and then spill all the gory details here.  Would anyone be interested in that kind of journalism?  Just wondering.  Signed, PB         "
"           I was planning on going to  urlLink this  on Saturday, June 26th (opening weekend).  Anyone want to join me?  Here's a decent  urlLink review .         "
"           It's not me wearing a mullet, but you still must  urlLink check this out .  And do yourself another favor by clicking on the ' urlLink clown ' and the ' urlLink truck driver '.  Is it just me, or does Jesus seem to be pissing off most of the people in the pictures.  For instance, I don't think the  urlLink carpet layer  appreciates Christ's technical advice.  I think the  urlLink bank teller  is about to turn around and go off on him.  And c'mon, he's blatantly getting in the  urlLink barber's  way!         "
"           All right, it's been some time since we got a picture all up in here, so I present this nugget from the past:     There was a time when mullets were king.  There was also a time when I bought my car for $300.  This time was captured on film and will haunt me for eternity.  Here I posed with my beloved 74 Oldmobile Cutlass Supreme which I affectionately named 'The Missile.'   DJS, why the wistful look?   I had to 86 the car for my blue pickup.  Moments after the picture was taken, a scrap collector came and took 'The Missile' to that great automobile graveyard in the sky.    Alas, old friend, I hardly knew ye.         "
"           It's like  urlLink everything I know is wrong .  Does this mean that Bono DID NOT die for our sins?????   U2 is yet another very worldly, ungodly band claiming 'Christianity'.

"            urlLink This  couldn't have come from anyone but my little brother.  It's a keeper!         "
"           As rainy as it was, we still ended up having a grand ol' time in Wisco.  My little brother and sister-in-law forced me on every major rollercoaster at Great America.  We, of course, saved the best for last:  urlLink Superman .  You are strapped into the seat and then literally turned head-first into a 'flying' position.  I just about crapped my pants as we inched up (your whole body faced the ground) to the first major drop.  At one point the ride goes through a loop that has you riding on your back, facing the sky.  That's so not right.  How my brother summed it up: 'Dude, your body is definitely not made to be subjected to that kind of G-force.'  It was killer.  We wanted to go skydiving the next morning but our plans were foiled with the incessant rain.  So we all went to a  urlLink movie  instead.  This was not my first choice, but I wasn't paying so I had to go along.  Now, I'm all for the latest action/thriller/destruction flick with cool special effects, but this film had some 'dramatic' parts that were so over-acted it was comical.  I know going in I shouldn't expect Oscar-winning performances, but I did expect more from Dennis Quaid.  Here's a quick break-down...   What was good:  - The special effects - the realism of the destruction of the cities and the progression of the storm was great.  Seeing the Statue of Liberty get pounded by a huge tidal wave had terrific entertainment value. - Jake Gyllenhaal = eye candy - The guy who played the Vice-President of the US looked a lot like Dick Cheney - just a little taller, and just as big of a weenie.   What was bad:  - The token bald kid with cancer with the unresolved ending - you know, because for a drama to be heartwrenching, some kid has to have a terminal disease! - As my very nurturing mother kept pointing out during the snowstorm scenes: 'Dennis Quaid is never wearing mittens!'  Bundle up, fella! - After Dennis Quaid's character figured out the potential end-of-humanity storm was on its way, he took the time to make a couple of cups of coffee and talk about 'the good times' with his wife.  Yeah right. - How they tied in 2 love stories was so damn contrived.  But at least it gave the movie some other subplots to distract me from the kid with cancer. - The wild wolf scene - so fake it was funny...plus, they didn't need this scene anyway.  But who cares!  Take this one for what it's worth...a summer movie with entertaining visual effects.         "

A turning point for the nation    By Barbara Boxer    EVERYWHERE I go, I hear the same thing: 'This is the most important election of my lifetime.'   I think I know why. We are broke, and current policies are digging us deeper into debt. When President Clinton handed the Oval Office keys to President Bush, we had a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we have deficits and debt. Our-go-it-alone policy in Iraq has isolated us from our allies and placed the burdens of the war on the backs of American taxpayers and our men and women in uniform.   The rollback of more than 350 environmental policies and regulations is leading us toward dirtier air and water, more cancer, more asthma among our children, and a loss of our pristine lands. The No Child Left Behind Act is turning into a hollow, empty promise to millions of children.   Then there are the terrorist threats -- this administration holds a press conference about these threats on almost a weekly basis. But where is the plan to protect our people and to catch those who would do us harm?   Congress is ready to move on Homeland Security. There is a rail security bill that is waiting for full Senate action. There are also port, nuclear, and chemical security bills that the Senate Majority Leader can call up whenever he pleases. Surely he would focus on national security after Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned that Al Qaeda was planning another large-scale attack.   But no. Republicans and the president want to talk about an issue they consider more important than saving American lives from another terrorist attack: more important than education or deficit reduction, more important than our kids getting asthma or our sons and daughters losing their lives and limbs abroad. The issue: a constitutional amendment on marriage. Yes, this is the most important election of our lifetime.   We need to get our priorities in order. We can start by electing John Kerry president.    Barbara Boxer is a US senator from California.              "
"           hi folks,  the resident Atlantan decided to actually post! I've been checking the site most days and glad to&nbsp;read you all are holding up the web site discussion group quite nicely. this will just be a brief update from my neck of the woods:    1.  I got myself a job. So it's the end of&nbsp;the 'After School&nbsp;Couch Project'&nbsp;officially. God I loved it while I had it, but it's time to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;and get some cash in the dwindlin bank account. and I'll also be getting some fitness work for the 'ol resume.    2.  I went out for my first night on the town with  friends  last night. That's right, I said friends. we did some boozing in the Virginia Highlands part of town&nbsp;and had some good times. Although I am generally not a 'go out all the time' kind of gal, I miss being able to call up people to hang out for some drinks, music and conversation. So it felt pretty nice to enjoy the evening. And the Atlanta men were quite the sight for sore eyes...which leads me to #3...    3.  I'm done with stupid internet dating. I signed up to meet people when I moved here and if I hadn't met Isaac (drinking and band buddy) it would have been a total bust. Jebus. I suppose my rules of not dating Confederate-flag-totin, ZZ Top-beard-wearin, guys-who-can't-form-a-coherent-sentence really limited me. I'm an independent babe and if I think someone is attractive, I have no problem initiating the conversation (this is over email, for crissakes) but so far NOTHING.&nbsp;Are the girl/guy roles are different in the South??   Anyways, things are going real well here. I miss the 'landahz very, very much and look forward to a jamboree soon (pending airline prices!) take care y'all.  -BB            "

"           Perhaps F9/11 just&nbsp; urlLink whetted&nbsp;your appetite  ?   Check&nbsp;this one&nbsp;out at a Landmark Theater near you on July 30th.  &nbsp;  With regards to F9/11: I&nbsp;never said&nbsp;F9/11 is not an important film (it is), but&nbsp;as a documentary-junkie I couldn't live with myself and&nbsp;say it was the&nbsp;greatest  documentary  ever.&nbsp; IMHO, it is an entertaining and powerful FILM only.&nbsp; Go see&nbsp;Winged&nbsp;Migration, Spellbound, Capturing the Friedmans, Touching the Void, or even&nbsp; urlLink The Lost Boys of Sudan   for examples of some top-notch documentaries.&nbsp; (Side note: I hear&nbsp; urlLink The Corporation   is not to be missed.&nbsp; I plan on RUNNING out to see it.)  &nbsp;  With such a powerful subject at hand in F9/11,&nbsp;I believe it is difficult for those so vehemently&nbsp;in agreement with Mikey&nbsp;to also be&nbsp;opposed to his method of filmmaking.&nbsp; He is crafty and clever, yes, but I wouldn't say he is artistic.&nbsp; His documentary is more ranting and raving than effective filmmaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is&nbsp;sloppy, illogical and formulaic,&nbsp;which&nbsp;begs the question: Can a hatchet job actually elicit  sympathy  for its sitting-duck target?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I do understand that wasn't his point (to be artsy).&nbsp; I'm just sick of&nbsp;reading reviews&nbsp;declaring Moore to be the best documentarian in the biz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Let's see if The Hunting meets my high standards. :)              "
"           In a scene that typifies the entire film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore shows a stereotypical All-American boy talking about winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people and teaching them about freedom and democracy just after a harrowing scene involving a late night (pitch dark) raid into an Iraqi&nbsp;family's home.&nbsp; We don't know why the raid was done or whether it was appropriate or not.&nbsp; We can intuit that since the beginning of the war, some raids have taken place without justification or with ill-founded justifications because we know that war is hell, but this scene, which makes it extremely easy to empathize with the set-upon family, is bone-chilling.&nbsp; As humans, it's impossible to watch without feeling for the family and without being thankful that it's not happening to you.  &nbsp;  I say it typifies the movie because the emotional impact of the scene and therefore the movie is undeniable.&nbsp; Michael Moore has made Fahrenheit 9/11 with the purpose of affecting a response, and he does it.&nbsp; I laughed out loud several times during the film, I cried at least twice, and I left awestruck and outraged.&nbsp; Presenting the material as he does is extraordinarily manipulative.&nbsp; It is propaganda (in the way that the word, divorced from pejorative connotations, just means to share information in a way that persuades people) of the highest order, and I understand why he has drawn comparisons to some of the great propagandists of all time.&nbsp; Moore uses slight of hand, juxtaposition, irony and maybe commits the sin of omission from time to time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;he is not dishonest.&nbsp; It is one of the finest movies I have ever seen, and I am convinced that it will change the world.&nbsp; It may not lead to regime change here (the film might be so incendiary that it actually makes those who are not inclined to see it Mike's way even more recalcitrant - or, gulp - even more motivated); but it will change the way campaigns are carried out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have seen two of Michael Moore's other films:&nbsp; 'Roger and Me' which I thought was unique and engaging, but ultimately more tomfoolery than substance, and 'Bowling for Columbine' which I thought was brilliant at times, but lacking in subtlety, and filled with poor decisions (he ends up looking like he was picking on Charlton Heston.&nbsp; Yes, Chuck Heston is an asshole, but the effect Moore wants is not for us to feel sorry for the asshole, and even an asshole comes across as sympathetic when that asshole is about to go down to Alzheimer's. &nbsp;Asshole).&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I tend to judge those I agree with more harshly than those I don't agree with, and Michael Moore earns more of my criticism than he should.&nbsp; In this film, he seems to have invested his heart and soul into its message, his mind and energy into it preparation, and his connections into its distribution and promotion.&nbsp; It is so direct an attack on a sitting President, I had the thought, as I drove home, that Mr. Moore might end up dead here pretty soon.&nbsp; It is that powerful.&nbsp; One review I read said it best: &nbsp;'as the man said, if you shoot for the King, you better kill him.'  &nbsp;  It seems that just about every decision he made was the correct one (and yes, logic tells you some things are a bit far fetched. For example, George Bush is criticized for removing the name of a fellow soldier from a medical report that he issued.&nbsp; That soldier goes on to become powerful and connected and corrupt (tied into the whole Carlyle thing).&nbsp; The implication is that Bush removed his name so that we would not see that connection.&nbsp; However, I know from my days in the trade, that when sending records out related to a particular person, it is routine to delete references to private information concerning other persons who are not covered by the authorization to release records.&nbsp; Yes, it is possible that at the Presidential and media level, the rules are different (the media may want to know that soldiers name so that they could interview him about W in his National Guard days), and no, Moore could not go into that level of detail and still have a watch-able movie, but you get the sense that motives are being attributed when they shouldn't be.&nbsp; By contrast, much has been made of Minnesota's own Mark Kennedy who, when confronted about signing up a child to fight in Iraq, apparently said to Moore that he had a nephew in the military (but not in Iraq) only to have his response edited out.&nbsp; When you see the film and you see the look on Kennedy's face just before they cut to another scene, you will know why  I would have ended it right there too, if I had Moores flair and talent).&nbsp; I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that for me, the end result will be stunning for some.&nbsp; My life was changed forever, but as I was busy quoting my&nbsp;dear friend HAL who said 'if even 1/10th of it is true, Bush should not be President,' I looked&nbsp;over at Mrs. Duf, who, at some point during my 45 minute tirade, had fallen asleep.

"           I had another weekend of music combined with some liberal politics, fresh air, beer-drinking, and frisbee. We headed up to the Green Man Festival in Duluth on Friday afternoon and were greeted by throngs of hippies camping out at the festival for the weekend. My version of camping out was booking a hotel room for under $100/night. The festival was kind of dead since Willie Nelson (the headliner for the fest) cancelled at the last minute, but we stayed anyway and played glow-in-the-dark frisbee and stopped at some political and environmental booths and drank Rolling Rock and ate Jamaican jerk chicken. Spirit Mountain was a cool-ass place to throw this party (what a view of Duluth and the lake below!), but unfortunately hippies are no good at running events of this magnitude. Their hearts were there, but the business acumen was definitely lacking. I'd love to whip that group into shape and take over this event for next year. Alas, I have this other crappy day-job to attend to.   Cracker was great, aside from the drunk fool who stood next to us and requested (more liked bellowed) 'Low' after each song. We also watched this really impish, quirky folk singer named  urlLink Haley Bonar . Not bad at all.   Saturday was spent driving along the North Shore and stopping for smoked fish and seeing the lighthouse and waterfall. We stayed at the festival until about 10:30pm and then drove back to the TC (after first stopping at Black Bear casino to try and get a room and some nickel slot gambling in - no vacancy).   Sunday night was First Ave's  urlLink Rock for Democracy  show. All proceeds from tickets, T-shirts, etc went to the DFL party and they had tables scattered throughout the club to register voters. (Duf, I'm  this  much closer to voting for Kerry, I swear.) Mayor RT Rybak was there wearing a Wellstone T-Shirt. Before the Flops hit the stage, he gave a little speech about getting the current guy out of office, etc, etc...and then he did a stage dive into the crowd. He said he wanted to be the first mayor ever to stage dive at First Ave. So excellent. The Jayhawks all showed up at the last minute to play a 20 minute set. Dave Pirner (formerly of Soul Asylum, now Golden Smog, sans dreads) walked on-stage during Jessy Greene's set and sang a fantastic rendition of 'Black Gold'. Dan (Semisonic) and Matt Wilson (the  urlLink Flops ) sang 'Made to Last' together. It was local music overload (in a GOOD way).   *whew*              "
"            1. What color ink pen do you like best?   &nbsp;  Im true to blue.&nbsp; Like HAL, I use black the most, but I would use blue if left to my own devices. Still, 90% of my pens are black.  &nbsp;  I dont buy cheeba; I grow it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?   &nbsp;  Paper without lines. Yes.&nbsp; It is difficult to write in straight lines, but the end result is much better.  &nbsp;  If youre drinking, dont drive, and if youre driving, dont drink.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?   &nbsp;  It aint even close:&nbsp; the library hands down.  &nbsp;  Hey ladies in the place Im calling out to yatheres never been a city kid truer and bluer.&nbsp; There's more to me than you'll ever know...&nbsp;  &nbsp;   4.

Do you have a paper weight on your desk?    I have a weight of paper on my desk, but not a paper weight.   I looked out the window and seen his bald head.&nbsp; I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg.            "
"            Alright, so I've missed the FF... even if more often than not it sucks.    &nbsp;   1. What color ink pen do you like best?   I prefer blue, though I use black the most (more widely available??).&nbsp; Red is always fun,&nbsp;and it reminds me of my AP European history class, senior year of High School... Mr. Wurst always had us read photocopied text and underline important passages with a RED pen (no blue ink, and absolutely no highlighters).&nbsp; Teachers are, by definition, eccentrics.  &nbsp;   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?   All about the lined paper!&nbsp; Plain paper is for people who sketch strangers in bus stations.  &nbsp;   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?   Hands down, books from the library...&nbsp;why spend more time in front of a computer?&nbsp; Though I can't remember the last time I checked out a library book.  &nbsp;   4. Which would you rather get, e-mail or snail mail?   Beggars can't be choosers.&nbsp; But snail mail is always nice.  &nbsp;   5. Do you have a paper weight on your desk?   Nothing that is a paper weight per se, but a bunch of crap that could be used as a paper weight in case a wind storm comes through the office.&nbsp; I like nick-nacks.             "
"           Yesterday I stopped&nbsp;at the Dairy Queen on West 7th in St. Paul.&nbsp; The best part about the trip?&nbsp; On a nearby power-box, someone had spray-paint-stenciled the image of Tim Pawlenty with the words 'Republican Lapdog' under it.&nbsp; Sadly, recent&nbsp;state funding decreases&nbsp;for the&nbsp;City of St. Paul will mean that there&nbsp;are less resources to clean unsightly graffiti.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;Timmy's face will be there for some time.&nbsp; Suddenly, my cone tasted 100x better.

"           TinyE is really stepping up the potty training.  There are three concerns related to this wonderful happening.  But first, some background:  When you have a child, there is a phenomenon where friends with children who are older than your child will tell you what to expect with a milestone for your child (like learning to walk or learning to talk).  Intuitively, you think that the days when your child is potty trained will be wonderful because, you imagine, you will be done with diapers which are decidedly unfun.  Here's what you learn -  The nice thing about diapers is that they catch stuff better than underwear does.  Enough said?  I can elaborate.  TinyE, as part of her progress, now proclaims a need to potty when it is very inconvenient.  For example, you learn very quickly how few restrooms there are at neighborhood playgrounds.  So, while she is swinging or enjoying the slide or monkey bars, you can count on her needing to go, and you can also count on her not being able to hold it while you drive to the nearest Hardee's.    Last, for you penny pinchers out there:  you are going to lose a lot (and I mean a lot) of toiler paper as your child unrolls it, and puts in in the toilet for no damn reason.    Just a heads up...         "
"           Apparently our conceal and carry statute has been ruled unconstitutional by a district court judge.  Now, that does not mean that it's all over, but it could be the beginning of the end.  The Court of Appeals is the next step unless the Supreme Court wants it on a fast track. The grounds are somewhat technical, but if it works, it works.  I will say that it is worth doing.  Any police officer or firefighter (ahem) will tell you:  we don't need more guns on the streets.  A good friend of my just lost his job as a teacher in the Minneapolis Public Schools.  So, HAL's blog expressing outrage at the layoffs and the Governor's pathetic nonchalance has now hit close to home.  My friend, DS, works with children who have behavioral disorders, and the thought that he won't be there doing that good work is amazing and sad to me. It all comes down to this:  as Americans and as Minnesotans we can afford to do better.  Those who are aggressively opposed to tax increases (NOTE:  as incomes rise and as inflation rises, the cost of government (its administration and the provision of its services) rises too) can keep plenty of money, drive ridiculous SUVs, have lakeside cabins and lead lives of opulence, while still supporting our schools, libraries, environment, infrastructure and way of life.  We can afford to prosper and support government services at the same time.  Don't make the mistake of seeing it as an either or proposition.  Look, I don't want to overdo anything - I don't want to have overfunded schools or libraries, but I want to have an adequate number of teachers and good student/teacher ratios.  But hey, if we are going to provide core services, let's at least do a good job of it.  Anything worth doing as my grandpa used to say...anything worth doing...   BONUS FEATURE (Two 3 Word Paragraphs as an Aside):   I miss BB. Bush must go.         "
"           It's not that I don't agree with  urlLink some of the things Bill says .  It's just that I see them as exactly the type of generalization that is emblematic of ignorance.  Is it stereotyping to say that stereotyping of this sort is for morons?  Yes, there are people (of every culture) who are undereducated and say and do ignorant things.  There are folks out there who are not model parents.  But, it seems that they get more attention than they are due.  There are plenty of hard-working Americans who have less but strive for betterment.  The connection that Bill draws between the poor and the ignorant is a bit to cozy for me.  Yes, there are many folks (African Americans among them) who cry discrimination too easily.  But, Bill's statements here can be sloppy to the point that they undermine legitimate claims or get co-opted.  I'm not sure I wouldn't trust an Affirmative Action opponent not to leverage this same argument and cite Bill Cosby as the source.    Also, take special note of Jesse Jackson in the background.  Is he sleepy? Does he disagree?  Is he dreaming of that extra-marital affair he had that one time?         "
"           And what a weekend it was...   Friday:   They Might Be Giants  at First Ave.  Never really heard them live before, and don't even have any of their albums, but we had free tickets and damn if they weren't funny and entertaining!  Kinda like Barenaked Ladies lite.  Afterwards we headed over to the Marshall Field's Music Days free show at Orchestra Hall.  Gary Louris (lead singer of the Jayhawks),  urlLink Brenda Weiler  (cute as a button), and Adam Levy (of Honeydogs fame) each sang 35 minute acoustic sets.  It was dreamy.  Gary singing 'Stumbling Through the Dark' (just him, his guitar, & his harmonica *sigh*) made me well up.   Saturday: The Basilica Block Party.  We went to the stage where Dan Wilson (lead singer of Semisonic) was playing.  Other than the annoying drunk floozies who parked their over-tanned, over-siliconed selves right next to us, it was heavenly.  Danny Boy sang only a couple Semisonic tunes ('Secret Smile' and the overplayed 'Closing Time') but the rest was his own original stuff.  Made me want to go out and buy his album ASAP.  As we enjoyed some fried cheese curds, we heard  Five for Fighting  in the distance on the main stage. (or as I like to refer to them as - 'Five for Fucking Horrible') They weren't really that bad, but if I hear that stupid song '100 Years' again, I'm going to barf up my cheese curds.  Later on we saw Hal, with a few drinks in her, wearing a leather skirt at a gay bar.  She can give you the details on that outing herself.    This Coming Friday night:   Cracker  at the  urlLink Green Man Festival  in Duluth.           "
"           Probably one of the most fun things about dating someone new is figuring out all the cool/interesting/kinky(?) places you can go to on dates.  I was perusing the 'Best Of' lists on Citysearch, and found the list for  urlLink 'Best Date Spot' .  Most of the choices made sense: Zelo, Loring Pasta Bar, WA Frost, etc.  But then I got to the bottom of the list.   The Olive Garden??   I'm sorry.  Am I a snob if I say I'd dump a guy if he took me there on a first date?  Not to say the salad/bread stick deal isn't a good idea when you're short on cash...but Holy Christ!!

"           I don't hate anyone, and I have an especially hard time truly despising anyone that I've never met.  But in the past couple years, I've found two politicians that I'd sooner punch in the face than shake hands with - our President, and our Governor.  Pawlenty has done lots of things that I find insane and unacceptable (our concealed weapon law and apparent hatred of expendable public services like a police force quickly come to mind).  And while it's not surprising, I read stuff  urlLink like this  and wonder how anyone can support this guy.  As a product of the Minneapolis Public Schools, I can say that I envy anyone who can teach in them.  Putting up with what the teachers must tolerate each day, all for a sad excuse for a paycheck... only to get laid-off at the end of each school year (like a friend of mine who is an outstanding teacher at a district elementary school and has lost his job each year for the past four years), well, I couldn't do it.  Then to read crap like that from your governor?  I dare that man to enroll his kids in the largest school district in his OWN STATE and have the same cavalier attitude.  What a fucking idiot.

"           ...or something like that.  I'm in the middle of the biggest financial transaction of my life. I've made an offer on a place by Lake Harriet (totally low-balled it by about $11,000). It's not the end of the world if I they tell me to take a hike, but it would be pretty sweet if they accepted. They can suck it if they think I'm paying 12K just for the parking spot.  I actually had a dream about it last night - I dreamt they accepted my paltry offer with open arms. And then I dreamt I had a PBJ there to celebrate.  Maybe it's a sign that all my dreams will someday come true.  Anyway, I called my agent this morning to ask her to add something to one of the forms in the purchase agreement. Her roommate answered: 'She's actually sleeping right now.'  Great, I've got my life savings on the line and she's taking a snooze at 11am. That makes me feel  real  secure.  It's hard to comprehend why others in the whole process (realtors, attorneys, title companies, closing companies, mortgage brokers, etc) don't take the whole thing as seriously as I do -- because to them it's just another day at the office and another day at work.  So wish me luck...          "
"           Ah...not really.  But hey, if you've got some time to kill and you want to try a sweet game, give  urlLink this  a whirl.  Oh...and by the way: thanks to everyone who said nice things about my upcoming date with Fatherhood.   Well, except for Duf.  He said my kid's going to have a huge head.  Ouch baby.  Verrry ouch.          "
"           well the streak had to end...I received my first traffic violation today for failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign in a neighborhood with absolutely no moving cars in sight, which meant that I had to basically stop, turn off the car, maybe do a Chinese fire drill upon arriving at said stop sign to qualify as a  complete  stop. it's slightly pathetic that my 13 year streak has to come to end with this flimsy citation. at least pull me over for something real like cruisin' or maybe a little reckless driving. but alas, I need to keep the insurance rates on the down low...  and the Pandyland anniversary shindig sounds like a ton o fun, I sadly have to send my regrets. :( Any chance you all could come down to Atlanta for the event??  take care BB          "
"           Yo Pandies...  In one week, this here blog will celebrate 2 years of internet discussing.  That's right!  I think to commemorate this historic event, we should do something.  I don't know...take it back to the old school, have a pub crawl or maybe go out and do some karoake and enjoy the Champagne of Beers:  Miller High Life  What do y'all think?  We blew it last year when the 1 year mark came and went without nary a mention.  I also think this celebration should break the myth that Duf and I can't appear at the same place in public at the same time.  Just sayin'...          "

"           Duf, where the hell have you been?  Well two weeks ago I was vacationing on Lake  Mille Lacs  (don't hate) with my mother (REALLY don't hate) and my wife's parents (really, really, REALLY don't hate).  A good time was had by all.  I golfed quite a lot and would have golfed more if the man wasn't keeping me down.  I lost to my father in law (age 71) 6-0, 6-0 in tennis (trust me, he would take all of you in the same fashion - and by the way he plays with wooden rackets that he buys on eBay).  And, when I least expected it, I found the  urlLink love of my life .  I will never stray or cheat on you, baby.  You are everything to me.  Then I come back to work, and my  acc es s  to the net is down.  I called our IT guy.  Here's a replay of our conversation.  Duf:  My computer won't access the internet. ITG:  It's not your computer, it's Wernham Hogg's computer. Duf:  In any event I can't use explorer. ITG:  Have you rebooted?  Then, no kidding, after three days, he gets explorer to work again, and then everytime I type the letter 'i' or the letter 'p', my stupid computer (age 1 month) adds the letter 'o.'  It was poretty weiord.   After the last two weeks I've had, there is only two remedies.  First, you must blog (done).  Second, you must drink as least two  Jack  Daniels based cocktails (pending).  I missed you all, and here is a note for each of you:  HAL - I swear to God your gift is coming, and what 'til you see the retailer who is fucking me over on the whole thing (for the thousandth time it was NOT an eBay purchase.  I'm clean now).  DJS - You are going to be a phenomenal Dad.  I mean, one of the best of all time.  Your child is going to be loved and cool and it is going to have a big head.  Good on ya' mate.  Panda - I want you to love me even though I'm flaky.  It always goes from endearing to annoying, but it usually goes back to endearing.  Hang in there with me.  BB -  Best wishes on your exam.  Please send me a few ab workouts.  My situation is desperate (but not serious)!          "

"            I've been here for almost 8 months now, and all I can add to my resume is that I've developed super-human hearing.  You see, I sit in a cube farm next to probably one of the busiest areas of our office - the bathroom. So, if everyone goes to the bathroom the requisite 2 times a day (some more, some less), and approximately 100 people in my area use this bathroom, that means about 200 times a day someone walks past my desk, with my computer in full view.  Yet, I am still able to read tons of newspapers, goofy websites, and view/download photos on the internet without being detected. How?  It's the super-human hearing. It's become so well-tuned in fact, that I can tell exactly who is behind me, just by the sound his/her shoes/clothes make. My peripheral vision is not too shabby either. Flip-flops? That's Babs. Rustling-sounding suit? Easy - that's Jean. Pastel shirt out of the corner of my eye? Ha - that's our director.  What's especially nice: in the mornings, our boss uses this rolly-cart thing to bring her laptop in and out of the office. When she's rollin' on in, she's making a lot of noise. This gives me and my coworker enough time to stop gabbing (which we usually do for the first 1/2 hour we're in the office) and get in our seats and look busy. We both have developed this keen sense of sound detection.  It's brilliant!           "
"           Hi.  I'm DJ Shovelpants.  You may remember me from my occasional posts on this here site 'Pandyland.'  Yeah, it's kind of an internet discussion group.  You know.  Well, I haven't been posting much.  Why?  Probably because there hasn't been much news for me to share.   Then why are you posting now, DJS?   Nice set-up.  Thanks for that.  Well, I've actually got some news.  Coming this February, there will be an addition to the Shovelpants family.   You're getting a new dog?  Oh, that's great news!   Nope.  Around February 11th or so, I'm going to be a dad.   Wait, let me do the math.  You were married in April, that's....carry the 3, minus 2...plus 6.  Wow.  You guys didn't waste any time.   Oh, shut up.         "

"       Hello again.  This is the offical No Action blog, an extension of the   No Action   column that can be found on  urlLink www.thefootnote.com  every month. For anyone who stumbled in here, I am Anthony Eldridge, and   No Action   is a monthly rock 'n roll column on thefootnote.com, a monthly opinion webzine. For those of you that came over from TFN, I salute you. The pupose of the blog is to get your opinions on the various subjects I write about. The main concern of 'No Action' is how rock music fits into our culture, not just my personal tastes. Therefore, I'm going to be asking for your opinion on various matters, which will help with the column. You can also expect more inane ramblings on rock music, and if you've followed me this far, you must like that.  Anyway, keep checking in periodically, and don't forget to read the Footnote on the first of every month!         "
"        It's been a little longer than I had wanted between postings, but I have 2 good reasons for that. First off, my interent access has been spotty lately. I have loaded several spyware and virus checkers, as well as switch browsers from IE to Firefox, so hopefully that will help. And secondly, the wife and I have adpoted a dog. Her name is Jessie, she's a Jack Russell Terrier. We got her at the Franklin County Dog Shelter this past Sunday. She's had a rough past and is pretty timid, but is settling into her new surroundings well (with a few accidents...)  Anyway, I went to that show. Big-ups to my man DGrove for hooking us up with primo seats. It was a cool show- as I said earlier, I hadn't heard much of Guster or Rufus Wainwright, but I dug both of them. Guster was cool- good harmonies, good lyrics, nice feel. I was pretty blow away by Rufus. He has a killer voice and a real style onstage. He covered Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah', and I don't think anybody's written a better song than that. Just killer.  As for Ben Folds, man, I think he's great. Great stage presence, great songs, fun show. For those of you that have heard his Live CD, he did the singalongs from that, as well as the minor-key-dramatic version of the 'Song for the Dumped'. He played 3 songs from his 2 recent EP's, including   a more up-tempo version of 'Give Judy My Notice', with Guster backing him up. The highlight of his show were 2 new songs, both of which were pretty mellow. One was a song for his daughter, a companion piece to 'Still Fighting It' of the    Rocking the Suburbs   record, and the other was a tribute to Elliot Smith. Man, I just about lost it on that one. I have a lot of friends who kinda gave up on Ben after BF5 broke up, and I respectfully think those people should reconsider.  Anyway, gonna try to get to the record store this weekend to pick up the new Wilco record, so I can see if it is as disappointing as everyone says it is. Also gonna try to track down the new Hayden CD. If you don't know Hayden, do so. I swear, he's fucking Canadian Jesus.  And don't forget about the poll question.          "
"       Yo.  I'm back form vacation- 5 days in Maryland, and it rocked. I missed the Darkness's show at the PromoWest on Monday, but the trip was worth it. Anyway, I'm going to see the Ben Folds/Rufus Wainwright/Guster show on Tuesday, so I'll try to put up some reaction to it shortly. I don't really do reviews, especially for the column, so I'll be keeping it pretty casual. I don't do reviews for 2 reasons: 1) There are a million other people that review shit on the web and in traditional outlets, and the world doesn't need another person doing it; 2)What makes my opinion more valid than anyone else's? What I try to do is criticism; that is, supplying a (personal) insight into work, hopefully spurring the reader to think differently (or just more) about the piece in question. Reviews make a value judgement, and I think that's crap. If you like a record or a show or something, you don't need a dipshit like me telling you it's good.    Whoa, sorry about that, I kinda got going there. Uh, anyway, I'm also looking foreward to the new Wilco record.   As for the poll question... Alright, here we go, but I'd better get responses from more people than Johnny Rawk and DGrove- if ya'll are the only 2 that are reading this, spread the word. Ok, with out further ado... The first No Action Rcok 'n' Poll:  A  multi-part question: What was, in your opinion the most important album of the 1990's? What was the most important rock record of the 1990's? (if your previous answer was not a rock record) What was your favorite record of the 1990's?    Ok, email your answers to anthony@thefootnote.com  and check out TFN the 1st of every month, and check back here for what I hope will be more regular updates.         "
"         What's up everybody? The June column is up- hope everyone likes it. Let me know what you think.    So anyway, more about the blog. I haven't done anything with it since starting it because, well, no one knew about it but me and Dustin. But now that the column is up, we're up and going. So, what now then? Well, I have some ideas:  1) The No Action Mixtape. What I want to do is compile a monthly list of songs that follow some kind of topic; anything from standard categories like breakup songs and protest songs to some looser things like songs you play when there's a thunderstorm or song you play when driving. I think actually producing the tapes (or more likely cd's) may run afowl of copyright laws, but they can't do anything to us for complining a list.  2) The No Action Rock 'n' Poll. A weekly poll question, the results which may be cited in the column. I would like to use the 'Family Feud' polling method- that is, no choices, just answer what you wish.  3) A general forum for music lovers to band together. (More on that in July's column*)    But to do those things, we need people. So, if you read the column and the blog, post a comment to any blog entry or email me- anthony@thefootnote.com -with your desire to join the team. Also, spread the word! The more people that join in, the better!   Ok, I'm almost done being cheesey. But keep checking back for more No Action fun.                                                                         *subject to change         "
"       Hey everyone.  Sorry I haven't updated in a while, my home internet is still down (I'm writing this at work).   Feeling pretty optimistic, actually. A lot of good songs on the radio lately. We have a pretty fine local radio station here in Columbus, and they're playing some nice new shit: Morrissey, Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Pixies, the Postal Service, etc. Not too shabby.  Anyway, I'll try to get a longer post up soon, assuming I can fix my computer.                                  "

"            Hey crazy ninos!   I've decided to start one of these bloggy things. God has been teaching me suh much lately...tis a shame not to write it down somewhere. So alas, I turn to the wonderful world of internet. So hopefully I can keep up and remember to write the things in here. I guess we will see how it goes, eh? (that was for all of you Canadians out there....)  Peace.         "
"            Weekend Stuffeseses   My modem died so o I haven't been able to type anything on here over the weekend. Darn storms. Well, this weekend was pretty cool. I went to the Riverbats game with a group from Southeast Christian Church. It was the second game I've ever even been to ever. The other one was the Anaheim Angels...well unless you count little league, then I've been to three games total. Anywho, the game got kinda interesting in the last inning and then we lost.   I walked around the stadium alot. It was kinda cool seeing all of the different people. I prayed for alot of them as I walked past. God's really placed that on my heart lately....praying for random people....cuz with God it's never random. All of the people that I have any kind of interaction with whatsoever whether it's as a really good friend or the cashier who always checks me out at the store or the waitress at the restaurant or a person I pass on the street and never say a word to, God has placed them all in my life and in my path for a reason. That's so crazy cool to think about!!! It makes you realize how interactive God is in our lives, whether we realize it or not. It definitely makes me think more about my responsibility as a Christian to pray for these people and, if so led, to start a conversation and possibly some kind of relationship with them. I pray that God would place these people in my path and give me wisdom and courage to take advantage of the opportunities He's given me.  Sunday, I went to church. Woohoo. Kyle Idleman talked about servanthood and how we are called to serve not to be served. And our servanthood is not limited to people who are 'servable' (aka: nice, appreciative, respectable, yadda da yadda). We are also called to serve those who annoy us, are rude and unappreciative. And even if we know that they are going to hurt us in the future, it doesn't matter. This is such a big thing for me. I've been praying that God would truly help me to understand forgiveness as He sees it. I kinda hold to a kind of 'forgiveness' that says 'ok, i will try hard to get along with you despite the fact you've hurt me or ticked me off.' It's such bullcrap on my part. I've got to come to the point of realization that I will be hurt and I will be stepped on and even in those times I've got to step out and serve those people knowing that it will happen again but not allowing that to hinder my service or my thoughts about that person....anywho, it was just a whole lot about what I've been studying in Jeremiah....actually, I think I might just go ahead and describe in another post my current spiritual developments cuz they are suh exciting.   The Vine was really cool. Worship was awesome despite the fact that I thought the floor was going to cave in....but it didn't :O)         "
"            Distractions   The need to love. It is a strong and powerful force.  Not just to be loved but to love - to experience the fulfillment.  Relationships falter all around. It's hard to have hope.  Yet the need remains. Our very nature yearns for these things. Yet when I search for the object of my love, I am left wanting.  I wonder how people find each other, where it begins.  Still, the need consumes me.  I pray.  I hear others speak of their need - how it consumes their life.  I pray.  It consumes mine too.  I pray.  The balance between the heavely and earthly is oftern twisted for the earthly I can see.  But the heavenly surrounds me, lives within me. It penetrates my soul, my being.  Yet somehow I'm blinded to it's presence.  I trudge on down the sidewalk - the trees, the car, the people.  My thoughts shift. How can I devote my heart - fully devote - to this God.  A parking meter, a mailbox, a crosswalk.  The God of the universe, the mighty creator.  The gas station, a pothole, the noise.  He calls my name, but I hardly hear.  The traffic, the planes, the songs in my head.  Dear God, scream louder.  **This was written on 10-2-03 as I deal with the vice of allowing the distractions in my life to cloud my view of Jesus.**           "
"            Surreal   I find no comfort in my surroundings. The trees, The sky, Even the very air I breathe -  It all seems so surreal,  As if they were masks created to convince my mind That knowledge is found through sight, That love is found through giving. I yearn to see beyond what is here, Not with my eyes Rather with my very being. There is something more. Something so unexplainable and uncomprehendable. Something that most people shall never see. Nor will they miss not seeing it, For they view the world only with their eyes. To open oneself up to the true source of vision is far too terrifying. Not because of what is seen, but rather for us to truly see,  We must become transparent, Totally exposing ourselves to this harsh world. Yet even more terrifying, we must view ourselves as we truly are. So, we convince ourselves that happiness is found solely  In our state of blindness. A lie that swallows our desire to see.   **This was written on 8-5-99 when I was struggling through depression and God's role in it all. It is so awesome to see what God has brought me out of!! Still I find these words an insightful reminder of how deceptive our world can truly be and even moreso, how deceptive we are with ourselves.**          "
"            The Point Between   Confusion steeps my soul with words much too difficult to say.  And I sit here. Here in complacency, Here in denial, Here is self absorption. I don't want to talk about it. Not because I don't want to deal with it but because I don't know how. How to express the thoughts I'm thinking.  How to make sense of the things I'm feeling.  It all seems so circular.  I don't even want to think about it  Because I keep ending up at the same points over and over again. The bottom line is that it doesn't make sense. Is it me or is it them? Now I don't even know.  And if it is me, then how can I truly know anything? At all? I can't. I don't. So I sit here. Here in confusion.  Here in hopelessness. Only is doesn't really feel like hopelessness anymore. It is beyond that. My brain is foggy. I want to give up. But for what? A life of ignorance? Can I ever truly be happy with these thoughts in the back of my mind, knowing that I would be living a lie? So now, the problem is ever before me. While the solution evades the entire plateau of reason. I'm tired of talking about what I want.  It doesn't make a difference anymore. I just don't even want to think about it My body is exhausted from the constant searching.  It must end. There must be an answer. But where? Not in the frail logic of man. Not in the ever-changing emotions of man. Not in the hypocritical actions of man. Not in man at all. It must be elsewhere.  In a place we continually try to overlook.  Our stupidity drives us in the opposite direction And our pride keeps us there. Now it is no longer just about me. No, now it is about the whole. Humankind. We continue to look the other way as salvation stares us in the face. But we can't give up what little we cling to. Somewhere along the way,  We were misled into believeing that this world is what our existence is all about. Pointless. Ignorant. We have tried to remove the true source of all that is. Thinking that we are the inventors, The discovers, The creators. Can we invent something that is already made? Can we discover what is already known? Can we create what has always been? We must relinquish this false power we believe we possess. For this is not the purpose. But still I sit here. Here as the whole. Here convicted of all that has come between. Here, I sit.  **This was written 2-26-00 during a time when I was struggling through some very tough doctrine and looking at it all in light of how we as Christians, as people, live these things out.**          "
"             The Cost of Love    The world crumbles around me, As the darkness rushes in. All the words I spoke in vain Tear and rip apart my skin. Exposing me to what is real Exposing me to truth. I lay here stripped and naked Looking everywhere but You.  This truth it hurts my wearied heart, It makes me cry aloud. I try to quiet my aching pains As I whisper through the crowd. I smile and laugh and pass You by As if the world is full of glee But every breath I take Brings me closer here - to me.  The darkness - it cannot prevail. Trembling I turn to face my fears. I feel some strength within me. I fight back the showers of tears. You have a plan and this I know A plan to bring me life, A plan to watch my darkest hours To call forth your wife.  I turn to You with tear-stained checks How bright Your light does shine. I realize now, that the darkness I saw Was only because I was blind. By choice I went and shut my eyes Darkness filled my vision alone But when I turned and faced your glory, Radiance flowed from Your throne.  I thank You God that You are King And that You are filled with love. For in my own power I can never attain Your blessings from above. But you have bought redemption You have sacrificed To live a life in love with me Paid at the highest price.          "
"            Freed to Dance   The space between dreams and reality is an ever-moving line. It dances. It spins. It twists and glides. Sometimes my heart is filled with thrill and awe. Sometimes - with aching and anguish. It all depends on how this space aligns itself. The moment of truth. This dance makes it difficult to know with certainty Which way to choose, Which path to walk, Which heart to trust, Which soul to touch. For one side can not make decisions based on the other. They each demand my all, Yet I yearn for the balance. I am pulled and torn and led away- Sometimes for good, Sometimes for bad. I ponder on God's design- His decision to place man in a real world But to give him a mind that can dream up another. Sometimes those dreams rip us apart. Other times they pull us together. So I will join the dance- Performed to the song of God's providence, Led by the hand of God's grace. Sometimes I might fall. Sometimes I might soar. But this space between the dreams and the real, Truly make life worth living for.          "
"            Untitled   Nothing is ever quite what it seems, As uncertainty spins its web, Clouding the hopes I treasured. I try to resist the trap, But I am taken in Through my desire to live, to love. This isn't how it's supposed to be. This isn't what you're supposed to say. I have rehearsed it over and over again On the stage of my mind. So follow the script And we will be alright. But you don't, so we aren't. What am I left with? Disappointment and depression. Can't we try it my way, Just this once?          "
"            Ode to a Night of Little Sleep   My head is foggy as exhaustion overcomes. Faint memories of hostilities expressed fill my mind. What I have feared my whole life is coming to fruition. The uncontrollable release of emotions leave me volatile and unpredictable. I yearn for balance. I desire control. These things evade my grasp.          "
"            Avoidance   Life is well.         "
"            My Coping Skills   The mind-numbing bliss of Coronas and Saving Silverman shake me from a day of despair. A day full of avoidance as sleep provided an escape from reality. Damn reality.         "
"            Words Float Away   I try to conjure the words to express what I feel. But I can not fabricate them within the confusion of my thoughts. I only get brief glimpses of sanity as my thoughts fly by too fast for me to grasp. The world goes on as if all is well. The sun still rises. The sun still sets. The darkness still consumes the night. And I am left alone to wonder when peace will make it's presence known. The mundane tasks of everyday life bring no passion to my heart. I lack direction. I lack desire. I'm tired of scooting through life doing just enough to get by. I am not able to muster enough strength to take hold of my dreams. I have been beat down by the world. My arms, once strong, are no longer able to lift me from my burdens. My legs, once muscular, are no longer able to carry me away from the pain. So, I sit powerless as the world overtakes me.          "
"            Another Day   Confusion weaves a web around my thoughts. I grasp blindly for something to cling to...some sort of stability. I am met with nothing but empty spaces. As fear consumes me, I transform into an anxious creature, knowing nothing but the fight for survival. Hostilities scream within my head, warring with harmony for my attention. They win. They always win. I fight for control. But I lose. I always lose. As I torment myself, a victim of my own thoughts, I wonder if I will ever know peace. My only choice is distraction. It's a struggle but at least it provides momentary hiatus from the war within. But all too quickly it's over as I'm left to face the harsh reality. Religion, independence, career, confidence, school, spirituality, relationships, family, drama, friends, hobbies, passions, words, prayers, self discipline, understanding, edification, partying, hurts, depression, wounds, dissapointment...my world crumbles around me. Balance is non-existent. My strength wears thin. I can not do it anymore.          "
"             Group Therapy    Hostilities continue to war with my sanity. It sucks. It's never been safe for me to express my emotions. So I've held on to them, internalized them. Now I'm screwed. I'm tired of all the Christian shit about denying yourself, sacrificing yourself, anger is bad, what would Jesus do....God gave us our emotions so I'm sure he intended for us to use them. Not to suppress them in the name of piety. I'm so tired of my life of deceit. Now I'm ticked and I don't care who knows it.          "
"            Fun   Mind-numbing skills increase as I seek to fill my head with anything but reality. I'm getting better at this task. A weekend of wild fun in Nashville made it easier to cope. My reaction of absolute bliss versus my friend's hangover pains makes me wonder. But I don't want to think too hard right now. It was fun and that's all that matters. Now I trudge through the task of milling through my entire life of torment as I sort out what went wrong and where. All this to the tune of a cursing elderly woman who is darn friggin good at dragging things out of people. All this in front of an audience struggling through the same shit. I pray that peace will come.          "
"            Sleepy   I feel exhausted...emotionally, mentally, physcially. It's amazing how life can affect you. I don't know if this is natural or medicine induced or a combination of both. But I am worn out. Unfortunately, I can't sleep. There is no time.         "
"            Overwhelmed.    I don't know what other word to describe how I feel. There seems to be so much that needs work. So much for me to do. I'm stuck. I want it all to just go away. I'm tired of having to think about these things. Having to ponder these things. I understand my problem but I still don't know what the hell to do about it. I continue to distract myself. Sometimes I'm successful. Sometimes I'm not. In the mean time, I'm not about to commit to anything with anybody. My brain is shot. I can't even think straight. There doesn't seem to be a hope through this. Everyone says there is but I just can't even fathom the concept. I'm tired of it all. My obessive thoughts will ever plague me. I guess I should accept the fact that my illness will ever be before me. I can't fix it. Others can't fix it. I don't think it can be fixed. I'm tired of the hurt and the pain and all the shit I've been put through. I don't even care anymore.          "
"             Ten Broeck    Yesterday was my last day for group therapy. I so came to love that place. Hours a day in the midst of honest communication. It was something that I was missing my whole life. It developed into an environment that was safe, calm, and loving with Mary as our surrogate mother cheering us on and ripping us new ones - whatever was appropriate. I miss it. I miss being able to share my thoughts and feelings with people actually listening and me receiving honest feedback. I miss listening to other people and understanding the different fixes we use to compensate for our lost self worth. I miss being able to say shit and hell without being judged. I miss being about to talk about sex in a realistic way without being condemned. I miss being able to talk about my somewhat psychotic thoughts with people who are honest enough with their own shit to admit they've been in similar situations. It's amazing. We all had the same problem, just different symptoms. I need to take what I've learned in this setting and transfer it to my reality. But I'm not quite sure how that will play out.   There are many things I have learned about myself. I know more about my problem and where it stemmed from. I'm learning to not be so critical of myself. It is so amazing how our childhood affects every aspect of our adulthood. Those messages that get stuck in our mind play throughout our lives. Sometimes they are good messages and that's awesome. But sometimes they are lies and that's when we have to step back and separate ourselves from them. I'm tired of the deceit. I'm tired of trying to live up to other people's expectations. I'm tired of wanting people to view me as some super Christian. I'm confused about how my spirituality plays into all of this mess. But I know I've been dished out some fucked up religious views that kept me in a life of shame and guilt.   Well, I guess I will take it one day at a time. Today, I'm realizing that my crazy obsessions that seem to control me are actually my attempt to create chaos in my life because it's my comfort zone. It's what I'm used to. Throughout my life, there has been much legitimate chaos. I became so used to it that when it wasn't present, I was uncomfortable. So I start to obsess over past things to fill that void. I need to continue to realize when I'm doing this and kick it in the ass. Self worth is another HUGE issue. I basically have none. I need to restructure my thinking away from false religious precepts that have held me in bondage and toward the truth. Fuck lies.         "
"            Baptists...Those Dirty Dogs   Ok, so maybe it's the baptists that I hate. After years of growing up under the legalistic dogma that did nothing for me but enhance a sense of shame, I'm realizing that maybe belief systems aren't absolutes, like I had been led to believe. Years of hiding my faults and elevating myself above others as a disguise is coming to an end. And I'm damn glad it is. This screwed up behavior wasn't a conscious effort on my part. It was all that I had known. When things get messed up, you hide it. When you make a mistake, you hide it. When your family embarasses you, you hide it. You don't talk about it. Don't even acknowledge it. This is NOT healthy.   Then you throw in the concept of religion and the stresses accompanying a world view that life demands perfection and so does Jesus. You have people who give you pre-fab answers to life's crappy events and stare at you like you're nuts for not tapping into 'God's peace.' I spent almost my entire life struggling with depression. Whenever I would try to talk to people about it, I would get fucked up answers like 'Whatever is worthy, noble, blah blah blah...think on those things', 'You may be unhappy with the circumstances but if you ask God, He will give you joy even in the  midst of it all' and 'What would our passive Jesus do...turn the other cheek and move on considering it an honor to suffer for Christ.' Ok, so then I pray my whole life and where is this peace....no where. I am angry and hostile on the inside but Jesus doesn't like angry people....so Jesus must not like me then. But what if I just hide the anger and suppress it...maybe He won't notice. Again, these aren't things that I consciously thought about but perspectives I had developed based on the attitudes of those around me.   I don't even want to start on the attitudes of the Baptists as a whole. My time at Seminary was by far some of the worst years of my life dealing with people. As a whole, the Seminary community cared more about proving a theological point to elevate themselves above others than they did about other people. It's so ironic because it should be the one place with the most caring people but it isn't. They sit around and gossip in the name of 'prayer requests', they spread rumors and lies with no regard to the people they are hurting, they are dishonest with the things they struggle with leading them to a lifestyle of hidden sin stuck in a perpetual cycle, they get more upset over petty things like language and immodest clothing than they do about the reason they are even at Seminary....because people are GOING TO HELL. My years spent there were one big lie. It was enveloped in deception. They twist God's word to make themselves look better. This is not what I see as the church when I read the Bible.   Then there's my church that I grew up in...a power hungry pastor elevated above questioning and bent on intimidating those he comes in contact with. A church that says shit to you when you wear jeans to church because everyone knows that Jesus hates those disrespectful jeans. So we must all dress up and act like everything is wonderful so other people at church will think we are super Christians, all the while we are falling apart on the inside. Our families are eroding...dads are fucking younger women, kids are doing drugs, moms are popping pills...then we dress up in our Sunday best and act like everything is wonderful. It's bullshit.   I hate the deception and I hate the lies. I've done it for so long but I'm finished. No more. I'm not going to live my life to make other people view me a certain way. I'm going to be myself. If people like me, then they like me. If they don't, oh fuckin' well because I'm not going to bend over and kiss my ass for every person who won't accept responsibility for their own shit.   I don't know how all of this will play out but I know that things are definitely changing and I kinda like it. I have the right to live a life of freedom and not hold myself under the burdens of this shitty world. So, that's what I'm going to do.         "

It's one extreme or the other. Either side is unhealthy. You are to desire a balance between the two. But now, in my codependency, I have journeyed from the far left to the far right. I don't want to be screwed over again. I don't. And now I'm going to make sure that it doesn't. The problem is...I'm turning into a real bitch. To be honest, it feels good. But unhealthy none the less. I guess it's a process. I wish I knew how to find a balance...until then...I feel kinda bad for those who tick me off. I'm sure sooner than later I will feel remorseful for those I offend. Until then, I'm going to have fun with my new found freedom of speaking my mind.          "
"            beachchick     After a week in Myrtle Beach, I am quite dissappointed to wake up and not have a beach to run and play at in the mornings. The responsibilities of 'real life' smack me in the face. Vacation was so much fun. I am so glad I got to spend time with my fam (Mom, Lou, my sister Cindy, her bebe daddy Chris, my nephew Caleb, my step-nephew Tyler, my step-niece Taylor, my step-sister Amy, her husband Mike and my step nephew Alan) and also with Rachel. I was so excited to have a friend on my family vacation. It made the night time fun. It's amazing some of the shit we got ourselves into....all in good fun of course. It's so cool to go and meet new people and get to know them as well.     The first day we were there, we went parasailing. It was way fun. They make you sign your life over and keep saying it's for 'thrill seekers' but honestly it wasn't freaky at all. It was very relaxing. The banana boat ride out there was way more thrilling. Also the hot guys who operated the boat thing were more exciting. But I'm definitely glad I did it. It was very very relaxing.     The waves in Myrtle Beach are awesome!! Not as big as Cali but Cali waves are scary. Also, east coast water is warmer and easier to swim in. One night after it stormed. We went and fought the crazy waves for hours. It was sooooo friggin fun. We kept getting yelled at by the lifeguards because we were too far out!!! So much fun....for reals!!    We went out to eat at a seafood buffet place one night....actually it was a friggin Chinese restaurant that had a bunch of seafood. I felt ripped off but that's ok because we got all you can eat crab legs for $15. Rachel ate over 5 lbs of friggin crab legs....yeah, she likes food. We also went outlet shopping.....which seems to be my favorite past time lately. I got lots of fun stuff. There were a bunch of little shops along Ocean Blvd too. I got a cute little shirt for Caleb that said 'If you think I'm cute then you should see my aunt'. I had to buy it!!! I also got the cutest Corona outfit. I don't know why I'm so obsessed with Corona wear....probably because I'm pretty obsessed with Coronas....but you know....anywho, I got a cute little pink tank top with the Corona logo and a cute little white mini skirt thing with Corona written on the butt in pink.     Also, at one of the first stores we went to, I met this little asian guy, probably in his 30's. He worked there. We started talking and he mentioned competing in Aikido tournaments in Japan and I was like sweet. Cuz you really don't meet a lot of people who even know what Aikido is. So we talked for a bit. I don't know if he was hitting on me or what. It was weird. He was like maybe I can come to KY and teach you Aikido. He gave me his number and everything. I'm thinking um....ok. I don't quite trust him though because when I mentioned the name of the guy who started Aikido, Morhehei Ueshiba, he didn't know what I was talking about. And that's just weird. Oh well.It was weird. But cool to talk to a new person none the less.     The clubs in Myrtle Beach are  pretty fun. The first night we went out, we went to the House of Blues. They have a cute little deck bar area with a live band. We had a couple of drinks and were about to leave when the bartender came over and said this hot guy, Josh, wanted to buy us some drinks so...of course we didn't want to hurt his feelings. We ended up hanging out with him and his family and neighbors, who were all there on vacation, all night long. They were kinda wealthy. They bought us lots of drinks and we all danced (with all of them) and had fun. Seriously, they were all crazy!!! The whole family!!! They were staying in our same hotel so we all went back to their room and chilled. They were very cool people.  Plus Josh was hot....did I mention that???    The next night we decided to stay in and chill. We went all bummed out to the hotel bar and ended up having the most lame time of my life!! The woman who worked there was so annoying and harassed this guy for over 20 minutes about bringing alcohol into the bar. Finally I was like...WE MUST LEAVE NOW BEFORE MY BRAIN EXPLODES. She just wouldn't shut up about it.     So we got dressed up and went out to the Spanish Galleon which was kinda a lame club. We were bored out of our minds there too until we met Sean (Shawn?)....the coolest accountant in North Carolina. He was bored too so we started playing bar/club games to amuse ourselves. These consisted of dancing like retards in the cage (and amazing enough we fit in because most people there could NOT dance) and then picking out really ugly people or bad dancing people for each of us to go dance with. I made Rachel dance with this redneck with a mullett. Sean picked this bald funny looking guy in a 007 jersey for me to dance with. Unfortunately there weren't many busted girls for Sean to dance with so he got off easy. After that I spent the rest of the night dancing with Sean. He cracked me up to no end!! I wish he lived in Louisville because he is so the kind of guy that I go for....laid back and amazing sense of humor. I so regret not getting his contact info. Maybe I can find him with my stalker skills....who knows. Overall, it was a fun night with very little drinking. Probably the most fun I had.     The next night we drove down to the Freaky Tiki. This club is crazy. I later found out it's been on Wild on E and MTV. Fun times for us. We actually had gone to Mother Fletcher's first but it was lame. This older guy there bought us some drinks and then went with us to Freaky Tiki and hooked us up there as well. He was really nice and not creepy. Just said he wanted us to have a good time our last night there. Plus I think he liked walking around with 'hot chicks' (ha). Anywho....this place is nutso...it has beds with tables and stuff, flames all over the walls, tv's all over the walls. They even have a 'foam room' where you can dance in bubbles....really weird. Rachel went to take a picture and slipped on the steps and busted her ass. She has the biggest bruise now. It so sucks for her. We had to leave soon after that and on the way out this cute foreign guy started hitting me so I talked to him for a bit. Oh....I almost forgot....the boxer short contest!!! Fun times for the ladies.     That was the end of our fun. So sad. I am seriously sad. I wanna go back.  Ok, I'm done.           "
"            Reconciliation     Confusion still clouds my mind. Changes have been made. All or nothing has been epitomized. Things that used to mean everything to me now mean very little. I'm just tired. I feel as though I've spent my whole life trying to live righteously, putting others first and truly seeking a higher power. And now I'm just bitter. I've been run over, taken advantage of and treated like shit. I figured if this is how it's going to be, if my efforts are so in vain, then I'm going to live my life and have fun. Either way I'm screwed so I might as well enjoy it more.     It's just the inconsistancies in life that boogle my mind. For example, why is it that the 'good little christian' boys treat me like shit. They are disrespectful and twisted. And these are the people that are supposed to be good and encouraging. BUT...the drunk random guys from the clubs, they are quite respectful. When I say no, they say ok. Now what is up with this shit?!?!?!? It doesn't make any sense.     I feel like things are out of control. I know I'm being used but I'm using other people as well. So does it matter?? I don't feel bad. I don't feel guilty. I do feel somewhat uneasy if I think really hard about it. But I'm not sure if that is guilt from my actions or from my legalistic past that would tell me to never even speak with people who lived their lives in such a way. It's fucked up. So I'm just going with the flow, trying to survive. I am having more fun which is cool. I feel more free.     I'm having a hard time reconciling these things in my head. Beliefs, actions, values, virtues.....how do they all interact???           "

"                 I'm listening to Les Miserable, the London cast with Colm Wilkinson and France Ruffle. I first heard this album when I was at Otterbein. It was the start of a broadway revival of sorts and I was studying theater at the time. I remember listening to One Day More while laying on my stomach ... coloring or sketching I think .. in Cheryl's room with Caroline and a few others. Shannon and Missy were there. It was Shannon's album. Listening to the promise in this story at the start of my own artistic career.  I failed as an actor. Failed for most of the same reasons that make writing a blog so natural for me. As an actor I can never extinguish that part of me - the observing ego my therapist called it (but that was much later and in another context.) I wanted to be an artist but I can't achieve that lack of self-consciousness that is the hallmark of self-expression. In order to express the artistic intention an actor must suppress his or her conscious intent.  I'm too self-aware to be self-negating. Disappointing for an actor but it's been my saving grace as a person. The promise I hear in Les Mis these days is that of love and mercy for souls who dream and try and fail.      "
"                 Dammit my new Diablo character expired! It's so aggravating since I made a big deal about getting her special set of armor. It's especially frustrating because I know I played her for more than two hours but for some reason stupid Blizzard kept setting the clock back.  I can't believe I forgot to check it. And the most maddening part is that I've been deliberately avoiding D2 because I've felt shy and I  knew  I was being avoidant and I didn't try to stop it! Damn Damn Damn.      "
"                 I just took my remeron. That's an antidepressant that functions as a sleeping aid when you take small doses.  Sleeping is probably the key to everything for me. Or lack of sleep, rather. I've been an insomniac since I was an infant. Talking to my mom about it recently, she told me that when I was little I used to hold my eyelashes open to stay awake. I asked her why I did this and she replied, 'how should I know? You couldn't talk!'  She's still bitter about the fact that neither of us slept for years when I was a baby. In fairness, I was a beastly difficult infant.  Anyway, last year my therapist suggested that getting my sleep disorders under control would make a huge difference in my mental health. I wasn't sure. I'd spent my entire life getting too little sleep and I didn't think it was a problem. I thought I was used to it.  In retrospect I guess I was used to it but it was a lousy feeling. I'm much happier now that I try to sleep regularly. Healthier too.  I'm not crazy about the remeron. I take the soltabs which just dissolve on my tongue. This is terrific because I medicine tears up my stomach and with the soltabs I don't need to eat or drink milk or anything. But I don't like how much sleep I need to feel rested in the morning - 10 hours or more most nights. And I'd like to learn to sleep without it but no luck there at all.      "
"                 Aarrgghh - I missed a day.  I'm still trying to find my range here. It's all in my voice of course because I can't speak in any voice of my own but I haven't decide yet if I want to try specializing in a sort of notes or just continue with random thoughts that occupy me before bedtime.  The point of this is that I've been feeling self-conscious about writing. I also have started to build it up into something dreadful. That's absurd of course - my only real talent is for words and writing. I enjoy writing in its way. Or more precisely, I enjoy playing with my large vocabulary.  I'm not a writer in the sense that I feel compelled to espress things. My expressions are essentially effortless. This is how I sound when I talk, folks. :)  I started a blog because I want to exercise my writing and skills and, I confess, I want to see where I can go with a public proclamation. Alright, so far the public is me and the stuffed bears on my monitor but still. Baby Steps.      "
"                 I've been staring all evening at Stardock's WinCustomize site.     urlLink http://www.wincustomize.com/   WinCustomize is the home of a useless but fascinating set of programs that lets you change the way your desktop looks. You can change icons, windows, toolbars and so on.  Ok, ok -  not  useless. With Desktop X you can easily (honest - it's really easy) create gadgets and make your desktop into an actual place to do things instead of a big empty place to stick icons. Also, WinCustomize has terrific WinAMP skins too.  But the bits I like are aimed for aesthetics - pretty not useful - and more to the point pricey given my current state of employment. The good news is that Stardock offers a variety of deal and generous upgrade pricing!  The one I've got my eye on is WindowBlinds. This is the main one that governs how you can make your windows look, via WinXP's Visual Styles. I own WB 3 and I was thinking I'd have to put off upgrading until I find some more moola. But as I was looking around the site, I realized that as a prior customer, I could upgrade for just $10! Huzzah!  WinCustomize has been running what they call the GUI Olympics where they invite different artist to prepare graphics in categories like 'Most Creative' and 'Most Usable.' I've been salivating over this skin called Opulence (click on the picture to see it up close.)    urlLink http://www.guiolympics.com/skins2004.asp?skinid=172   I promised myself a reward for doing good today (more on that later) so watch me bust out that credit card!

Basically, if you're surfing the net and find something you want to add you hit your Blog This button and little javascript window pops up with the link in place and some basic tools. It's got options to spell check, save the blog as a draft or publish it, with a drop down box where you can select your blog if you have multiples. That's a nice touch, I think.  I thought this was purely a Google Toolbar feature but I was mistaken. It is built right into the Goolge Bar, if you use that. As an Opera lover of course, I don't need the Google Bar since it's redundant (in Opera, just type your search into the address bar with a letter prefix. for example, 'g collies' searches google for collies.

Is there some possible way to describe the hand over of power in Iraq without using phrases like 'thief in the night' or 'cut and run' or heaven help us, 'hightail'.  Yes, I know the cover-story is that we're doing this two days early to foil the dastardly terrorist. Honestly, running away because we can't stop  terrorists from attacking us is galling.  We've gone from 'Bring it on!' to 'Run away!' And it's not amusing.

"                 Wow, I finally got a decent night's sleep. I've been sleep deprived for ages. My normal sleep machine got broken a few weeks back. It was a homedics version. And then I was house sitting and had to get up at odd hours to get my Dad up for work (this is the condensed version, you recall.) Anyway I bought a different brand of sleep machine - this one's from Relaxor and also has soothing lights and aromatherapy. I think it took me a few days to get used to the different rhythm of the sound.  I've been calling it a sleep machine - what it is really is a white noise machine that plays sounds like ocean waves or rainfall and masks things like traffic noise and housemates and stuff. I really like this new machine. Hopefully I've adjusted now. Or maybe I've been too sleep deprived. I managed to give myself a migraine Wednesday that I'm sure was from lack of sleep.  So the name of this blog is 'Pillow Notes' and I'd intended it to be a few random jottings before I went to bed. The thing is I keep thinking of stuff to write about at other hours of the day. I like the concept of Pillow Notes but in practice I need to keep my bedtime less fraught with incident and I need to write when the inspiration hits me.      "

But the object of this exercise to face the problems I have with shyness and avoiding closeness with others. We'll just stipulate that there are 'others' somewhere out there and, if they so chose, they could in fact notice my writings.  That's no the point really. I'm doing this in search of a major audience. An audience of one would be sufficiently scary. The point, and I'd like to reiterate it since I'm rather proud of it really, is that I'm doing it.  So let's talk about me.  I worked in a library when I was a student. God I was an obnoxious little know-it-all. But I do in fact know a lot about books and writing.  I worked in the Children's Room which was terrific. Kid's books are still the best I think and I read them with pleasure. I like the pure inventiveness that is allowed to reign in kid's books. The stories don't have to be externally realistic - they work as long as the internal logic holds true. They can be a form of fantasy that needs not pay homage to D&D and before that, the Professor.  I'm not sure why I was resistant to becoming a librarian. I've considered libraries to be my natural and private game preserve. I suspect that I didn't embrace librarianship due to a combination of my reluctance to claim worldly goals and my lack of confidence in my ability to achieve them.  If you're looking for sites abotu kids' books, by the way, you've got to check out Jan Brett's page -     urlLink http://www.janbrett.com   Brett's work is outstanding of course but her website holds an incredibly generous and lovely amount of crafts and toys and pages for children.

"                 I am drinking a Balto Heroic Beer. It's good stuff. Very Very Good.  I say this of course but I should tell you that I don't actually like beer. I really like Bass but I don't like beer. That might change though. I might like Bass and Balto. B beers. Balto is a golden lager - very honey sweet. No bitterness. The opposite of Bass really, which is a dry bitter English pale ale. I'm not sure why I like Bass since what I hate about Beer is the dryness and the bitterness. I think I like Bass because Peter Wimsey does.  I don't drink very much. When I went off to college for the first time I made a bad habit of drinking to help me cover up my shyness. I stopped drinking when I got kicked out after my freshman year and I really didn't drink for years aftwards.  In someways this was good since I learned to move beyond my shyness. I fell back brazeness and I've always had a strong supply of that. I'm glad sort of that I didn't drink because in my stronger episodes of depression and avoidance I worry that I would have turned to that for a little help.  I drank far too much at my sister's wedding reception. Maybe 6-7 gin and tonics. That's always been my favorite. I can drink that stuff like it's 7-Up. I was pleased though that I didn't fall apart. I fell asleep immediately in the car though and then developed an intense craving for cheeseburgers.  Beer makes me feel a bit flushed and sleepy. I'd like to learn to enjoy feeling sleepy, come to think of it. But really, I'd like to learn to drink so I can enjoy the process occasionally.      "

"                 My gosh it's been two weeks. No wonder my nerves here are shot. I feel electricity in my ribs - ripple up my sternum. I keep hearing 'it's too hard.' It's too hard. It's too hard. Why does that come out of me? Where did that come into. I have no grace but words I have words like a song about spun from light and air that seeps through the glowing of my ribcage and illuminates my thoughts. I cannot claim to find enlightenment I can barely see where I'm going by the light of my voice. I can hardly feel my fear I can hardly breathe my fear and when the fear moves through me do my ribs tremble as they give song?       "
"                 I'm typing this in a new planning system.   urlLink FranklinCovey >  PlanPlus for Windows XP    Ok, I've mentioned before how I'm crazy about the Franklin Planners. I've been a fan of their paper planner for years but lately I've been thinking I could improve it.  So I cleared a space and really started working up a system but it's still too easy for me to ignore it sometimes. It gets covered with notes or I forget to look and really, it's still a pain because I've got vaules over here and goals over thee and I have to keep copying things back and forth ...  Anyway, I've decided to check out Franklin Covey's software. I have Outlook but being an Opera Fanatic - and specifically an M2 Fanatic, I'm not eager to haul the bloated beast that is Outlook. So FC is releasing a new set of tools for people who don't use Outlook. There's a 30 day trial and I'm already in love! This here is an attempt to use the PlanPlus Note taking system to back up my blogging. Hmmm - I note that there's no spell check ....  The beautiful part is that the goals tasks and missions are drag & droppable, they're right here! There's a whole section for planning your week and it starts at the Mision statement. Then it takes you to your goals - this is terrific - you can look over the steps of a goal and drag it into your week! It's so much easier to keep my priorites straight when the planning sessions automatically begins with the things I value most.  I'm dying to use this! I'm still going to check out the Outlook version but Franklin Covey has made a bigger fan out of me!       "
"                 It's eating my ribcage out to write this. I can feel that pull in lungs.  It's like glue dripping off my fingers. I don't want to write. This is pointless and boring and stupid. Why would I bother posting this.  History! It's fascinating to see an artist struggle and of course I use artist in the 'stupid wanker whining about his feelings' sense.  Is there value in doing this? Value in forcing myself to do it. It gets easier. I can remember when it was easy. Maybe I should set myself a word count. I've gone off the stream a bit. That's ok. It's easier to write maybe it's easier if I just type what I'm thinking and not try to write. I talk to myself constantly. Writing could just be typing down what I'm saying.   So what would I say about myself, in response to a question of why do you want to study here? Well first of course is that I love to study. I really miss being away from school. I still look forward to that first day when everything's new. So really I want to come and study here for the sake of studying.      "
"                 well it's been a disappointing week, all around. I managed to make myself ill worrying about the driving stuff. See I don't drive and I've developed a complex about it. I've tried learning but I always manage to ruin a car in the process. Last time I left the hand brake on while driving on the highway.  I've been looking into the blogging process. In truth, I'm rather ridiculously obsessed with it. I love TypePad but realistically, I'm going to aggravated by their wizard interface, I think.  I'd like to try Word Press down the road, or perhaps b2evolution. I'm excited at finding websites with such competitive pricing.  Also, I've been looking into CSS. I need to hone my skillz in that area in any event. I really couldn't switch to a personal site until I have better control over that.  In the meantime, I'm sticking with Blogger. I like it here. :)      "
"                 I'm not sure what's derailed my day more. My Mom's computer or my stupid sleeping schedule or the news that Bethesda Softworks is gig to develop Fallout 3.  My Mom's computer is just a vicious beast that taunts me to and snickers at the effect. I'm supposed to be the computer professional! I'm supposed to know what the fuck I'm doing. So why the fucking fuck does the game run THIS time that I clicked on the icons but ti didn't run the previous times? WHY? WHY!!! WHAT'S DIFFERENT????  Drive me right up the fucking wall.  Bethesda - I have mixed feelings. I think Fallout was one of the all time best games ever. Not as good Torment, mind you bet very very good indeed. Now Bethesda has made two of my personal favorite games of all times - Daggerfall and Morrowind. I love both of these games deeply and I think they have the most elaborate and detailed history and cosmology of any game ever made. Just leaves the Ultima games in the dust. But, I must admit, they aren't great games - not in the way that Fallout and Torment just grabbed the brass ring in their bloody teeth.  Also, Beth has never made a turn based game, to my knowledge, and I really do think a real-time Fallout will suck out loud. The combat in DF &  MW is really quite lame - a random wild clickfest. The tactical game in Fallout would go right out the window in a turn based scenario. OTOH, I can completely see Beth making a game that relies on charm and luck and intelligence to see it through. FO1 had a path that was completely non-combat. I can see Beth making a game like that and I think it would be dynamite.  Alright - lets see what else I can accomplish here.      "
"                 I've been playing with the colors. I wanted something a little more summery. Of course, I'll be wanting an Autumn theme in a week or two but maybe by then I'll know a bit more about CSS.      "
"                 I'm blogging today because it says in my planner that today I blog.  I'm using a Franklin Covey Planner, Daily Classic size with the New Yorker Pages. Those are cool pages they have a mono-tone blue border with the New Yorker font (you'd know it if you saw it.) Everyday it gives a little cartoon - the cartoons have long been the most brilliant part of the magazine - and a funny little news item. The New Yorker has a name for these spots ... I forget it though. Andy White use to write them. That part I remember.  Franklin Covey markets their planners as tools to help focus on the important part of life. The Franklin in their name refers to Ben, who kept a little diary where he outlined his goals and plans.  It's not so much a journal or a calander, although it's that too. The point is that you use their tools to help focus on what you want to accomplish. They have a series of guides that lead to your writing a mission statement for your life. Then the daily and monthly planners help you keep those goals in focus while getting you through the daily chores of meetings and work and assignments and so on.  Personally, suffering as I do from severe depression, I find myself feeling overwhelmed by tasks so I procrastinate and think of it as 'too much.' The more you procrastinate, of course, the more there is to be done and the greater the mental burden.  So I've been using my Franklin as a way to keep track - I outline what I want to accomplish step-by-step and I can look and see for myself that I don't have to do EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. My planner today says I need to pray, blog and schedule out next week. I've also chosen to clean my room and shower. (Believe me, for a person with depression this is like swimming the English channel, some days.)  Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel proud that I accomplished today's goals and confident that I can accomplish tomorrow's. It's a major turn-around in my mental process. Here's a link a link to Franklin Covey's site, just because I like to look there -   urlLink  http://www.franklincovey.com/          "
"                 I have lust in my heart for the Nokia 6630 Smart phone:   urlLink Nokia 6630   How can anyone resist this? It's adorable! It's slim and tiny. It holds an hour's worth of video. VIDEO!!! my current phone, the avant-garde 3650 is the spiritual predeccesor of this phone. It's a unique shape with a camera and odd phone number pad. The 3650 can record about 5 minutes of video.  This one's smaller (the 3650's main complaint is it's dial and it looks huge in photos, although it's not.) and eschews the odd design for standard number arrangement. Having held the 3650 while taking photos I can see that the shape of the 6630 with the roundish bottom has been designed for better stability.  The 3650 has mono sound but the 6630 will have stereo sound and headsets. It's got easily swappable memory chips so you can store mp3's or (I suspect) swap game cards similar to the function on the newest N-Gage QD (Nokia's gaming machine/phone.)  They aren't pushing the virtues of the 6630 as a game machine, unlike how they presented the 3650, but it's obvious that it has the features. It also has upgradeable memory chips. It's a series 60 phone with Symbian technology so it will play any of the game that run on the other series 60's. It's got the big video screen that the 3650 boasts - also the joystick.  It's got broadband access and the phone can be used as a broadband modem with wireless cards connecting it to your laptop. Also, you can connect with bluetooth. The camera looks like this -  1.3 megapixel camera sensor, effective resolution 1.23 megapixels for image capture (1280 x 960 pixel resolution)  and you can instantly print your photos.  I could go on about this phone for the next six months which is good because it will be at least that long until it's released.       "
"                 Man am I beat. I don't know what the deal is but I've been waking up at 3-4 every day. It's making me nuts. I can't get back to sleep.  Actually, that right there is the big issue. When I'm deeply tired I have to consciously relax my mod and mind. It's like prying my fingers off a ledge. And then when I wake up I'm not so tired any more (quite) and it's harder to let go. I've learned in the last year or so how to drift off if I'm deeply tired - the sleep medicine I take helps trigger the sleepiness - but I haven't really learned to fall asleep unless my body's just screaming for it. That's the next step I guess.       "

"       saturdays and sundays are the most memorable days in the lyf of a cadet.. during these days we used to rot and make happy. During saturdays we've experienced the most tiring part of cadets lyf. During friday night cadets are sleepless preparing things, fixing the room, ironing uniform, shining shoes, shining metal parts of uniform, follow-up underclassmen and etc. We are usually doing this in preparation of barracks inspection, ranks inspection and parade and review every saturday. Every saturday is a challenge and it adds up to our prestige everytime we overcome this day. During saturday morning barracks and ranks inspection, parade and review was done. During the afternoon cadets serving punishment take a tour around the boromeo field in BDA under arms to serve their punishment. While cadets who are snappy and not defficient in academics can have a privilege to go out in baguio city to visit their friends and poster parents otherwise cadets can entertain their visitors and friends inside the portals of the academy. Last friday night i went to sleep at 0100 at woke-up at 0430. First, i fixed my bunks and take a bath. I change my uniform for the sword and rifle drill early mess at 0530. at 0600, we rehearse the whole sequence of parade and review. We went back to barracks at 0700 to finalize our things. at 0745 i change my uniform to full dress white under arms for the barracks inspection at 0800, im happy coz i don't have any report of violations and demerits. At 0845 we went outside the barracks at quezon ave. for the ranks inspection, i got one report(loose thread, hehe). We are standing under the sun for an hour and went to the slope(the starting point of the parade). Usually, we waited for a long time before the start of the parade but that tym we only have 10 minutes and the parade starts. After the parade we have our noon mess at 1130. At 1250 we have the opening ceremony of our intramurals every companies have their muses. the assigned judges selects the best muse to represent the ccafp intramurals. the hawk company muse won, she is the former miss phillipines international and at present modeling at mexico. After the ceremony at 1600, 2cl and 1cl cadets went to baguio city for inviting privilege for the upcoming formal dinner and hop on august 21. we went back to pma at 2230. During sundays we have our religious services where in cadets went to their respective churches of their religion to worship. At sunday afternoon cadets who are serving punishment once again will tour around the boromeo field while those who does'nt have punishment enjoys the rest of the weekend. This sunday after the religious service all 2cl and 1cl cadets was given privilege to visit their poster parents. And i have visited too my poster parents. Now, another weekend will pass and another academic week to face...may god bless us all, always!     "

"   My first year as an attorney has had its ups and downs.  I guess that is to be expected, but the ups are certainly more fun than the downs.  Of course, the first and most important up was the raise I received upon passing the bar exam.  The first down was being threatened with Rule 11 sanctions, but that worked itself out and was simply the result of an older attorney from a big firm trying to bluff the new kid in the small firm.      In the beginning there was very little change in what I did as a law clerk and what I do as an attorney, the main difference being that I could finally sign my own name to my work.  I still ran to my higher ups for approval before filing anything, but over the last few months, I have actually been generating business.  Now that I have my own clients and my own caseload, it's much easier to pick something up and run with it than it was when other attorneys' clients were on the line.      I've done quite a few depositions and a few hearings.  Working in the firm that I'm in, I get to do a little bit of every kind of law, plaintiff and defense work, personal injury, class actions, insurance claims and defenses, EEOC claims, Workers' Comp claims, Social Security, the occasional divorce, etc.   At least, things rarely get boring.   The down side to that is there's alot of research involved due to the fact that we work with so many different types of cases, and many many briefs to be written.    As far as my personal life goes, I've finally given in and bought a house of my own.  It's nice to know that for once in my life, I don't have to worry about how I'm going to make the payments on things.  Of course, it's all my responsibility now too.  That was a little scary at first, but I guess that's just part of being a member of the real world instead of just a student.      Between the new responsibilities at work and the new responsibilities at home, things get a little stressful sometimes.  On the up side though, we've got two new law clerks at work and I've been given full permission to make use of them.  Oh the joys of inflicting terror into the hearts of the young and gullible.  It's my turn now to have the clerks cowering before my verbal abuse and unrealistic demands.  I learned well from the associate I worked under.  Seriously, I love my law clerks and I wouldn't dream of being mean to them.  The worst thing I've ever done is refer to their office as the day care center and the office manager as their babysitter.     "
"   Life has suddenly become hectic.  The title of this post is so accurate.  I've suddenly become booked for depositions, hearings, meetings, and so on that were not expected.  I truly hate going into a deposition on an hour's notice and not knowing a thing in the world about the case.  It doesn't help that the other associate in the office is causing us great worry.  He looks like he may have a breakdown soon.  I sincerely hope not because if he does, I won't be far behind.  School has started back, so our law clerks have returned to class and left us to fend for ourselves.  I kind of miss them.  They at least gave me something to smile about, not to mention that they certainly improved the view around the place.  That also means that my kids have gone back to school also.  In case I haven't mentioned it, I've got four kids, ages 12, 11, 9, and 7.  Boy, girl, girl, and boy.  The boys live with their dad during the school year and the girls live with me, so I do have a little help with them.  You would think that my life would be easier with them at school, but I leave for work about the time they go to school and I get back after they're home.  Now, I've got homework to deal with as well as getting them fed, bathed, and in bed before midnight.  Guitar lessons also started back for my 9 year old.  She is convinced that she's going to be a rock star when she grows up.  I must admit, she's gotten pretty good at playing Yankee Doodle.  She thinks she's ready to start playing Skynard riffs though.  More power to her.  She's still undecided if she wants to be a rock star, a lawyer, or a teacher--or maybe all three.  The older one wants to be a fashion designer.  She's a little too girly for my tastes, but hey, she is a girl after all.  I must admit that I don't agree with her on alot of things.  For example, we had a debate last week over a crown.  She ordered a bunch of crowns, tiaras, etc. from a catalog and she did not think it was appropriate for me to wear the king's crown because I was a girl.  I don't think I ever did convince her that the simple fact that I was female did not prohibit me from being king if I wanted to be.  I guess, to be technical, the definition of king does include male, but nothing says it has to be that way.  Hmmph.  I am doing one girly thing lately though.  I'm learning to cook.  I don't mean throwing something in the microwave and heating it up, which is my normal routine, but really cooking.  You know, with the use of a stove and recipes and stuff.  It's pretty cool.  I'm really into baking, but even though I follow the recipe, the mixtures I concoct generally end up being runnier than they're supposed to be.  Tip of the day:  When baking teacakes (aka cookie-like substinence) and the recipe calls for you to roll the dough out and cut the cakes before placing on the pan, do it.  Otherwise you end up with a huge pan of run-together cookie/cake mess that is rather unattractive.  Of course, in that situation, you're in luck whether your guests like cookies or cake.  You can throw one on a plate and call it whatever you like.   "
"   One thing that young attorneys should realize is that your life is not going to be all big exciting trials and intense negotiations, at least not at first. I have been lucky enough to work on a couple of those big exciting trials and even helped pick the jury for one -- my home town. Work for newbies is likely to mean lots of research, attending hearings on trivial matters (ie petitioning the court to approve a settlement agreement or to withdraw funds from a guardianship), sitting in on long and boring depositions, and my favorite (So Not!), collections.  That was a rather accurate description of my last week and a half. I am sick of harassing poor people with no money and ordering them to pay my clients. The hearings are okay. They get me out of the office and into the court room at least. The depositions though, that is an entirely different story. I sat in for a day on some of the most boring depositions ever. Of course, I've sat in on several of the depos in this same case before (there's only about 30 plaintiffs and they all have to be deposed) so I already know all the questions and most of the answers. That day had its moments though.  By the last deposition (around 6:00 pm), the deposing attorney was so tired that when he asked the deponent (a cute little blonde twenty-year-old) about her physical health, he just blurted out, 'Do you have any diseases?' Hilarious.  One of the other deponents was in the National Guard during integration and spent twenty-nine days on the Ole Miss campus when James Meridith started there. Now, the law school at Ole Miss has a memorial to James Meredith. Times have certainly changed over the last forty or fifty years. Thank God!      I guess there is an upside to all of this though.  Our chief partner just got back from Panama and has gone to Denver, and our three-year associate just got back from Europe and is going to Maui next week.  One day...  "

"        urlLink Yahoo! News - Rising U.S. Homeownership Brings Woes - Study   I'm glad that last night my wife and I decided to not be apart of the statistics that this article discusses.  Me, being a bottomline type of guy and my wife, wise and understanding, decided to hold off on your plans to purchase a home.  Even though we were approved for a mortgage loan, we both felt uncomfortable with making such a commitment at this time.  We therefore decided to give ourselves a six month time-frame to increase our income and savings and also eliminate some of our debts.  Though foregoing homeownership at this time may cause us to lose out on current low interest rates, I would rather be able to comfortably afford my home and maintain my lifestyle, than to be house poor and risk foreclosure.  I guess what was wonderful about the situation is that my wife and I both had similar sentiments.  We didn't want to make any rash decisions that would've risked our future.  During our conversation, we both confirmed that we were committed to striving to improve our lifestyle.  That's the main reason my wife has decided to return to school and major in nursing.  She stated, sure I could get a job in retail or as a secretary or whatever, but I want to contribute to our household in a substantial way.  After hearing that, I told my wife, I am committing myself to take my liscensure examination this summer, which would make me certified in my profession.  Ultimately, being certified could translate to a $10000 - $20000 increase in salary.  That is my short term goal, which would instantly put us into a totally different realm of possibilities.  Well until next time, please take time out daily to just think.   Thinking just might be the single most important act that could make the difference between your success or your failure.

"       Opportunity, is it always present or is it once in a blue moon?  When is it best to go after opportunity and when is it not?  These are questions that I'm currently asking myself.  I believe I'm a natural born opportunist rooted in wisdom and realism.    The question that I'm asking is,  can it be wrong to pass on opportunity when you feel and believe it may not be the right time?   Actually, opportunity from what I've gathered is when luck and preparation meet.  I feel somewhat lucky that I was approved for a home loan for the price range that I wanted.  However, I just don't think I have everything in order.  For example, I need to increase my monthly income and reduce my current debt to feel comfortable enough to commit myself to a mortgage payment.  Then if I say no, I don't want to disappoint my family.  So what should I do?  Well opportunity should put you on the path of progression rather than regression.  The path that you choose to walk down will determine whether or not you'll pursue certain opportunities.  I am not a pessimist, but I'm just cautious and I like to operate within reality.  Reality dictates that if I commit to this mortgage, there really won't be any wiggle room or margin for error.  Also, we have a baby on the way and that in itself is going to increase our monthly expenditures.  I guess to summarize, my response is the same that I give when people ask me how did I know my wife was the one?   When you know, you just know.   The fact that you have doubts or unanswered questions, should be the red flags.  There's no philosophical explanation, no magic formula or anything.  When that opportunity is for you, a sense of confidence and peace enshrouds you.   The bottom line is that it's okay to say no to some opportunities, especially if it is not time or it was not intended for you.          "
"       There is so much going on right now in our lives and it seems like everyone is looking to us (my family) for answers.    My response is, WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU WANT FROM US???  How dare you try to fit me into your box, just because you might take pills if you're depressed, just because you've done it a certain way all of your life, just because your house looks a certain way, doesn't give you any authority, what so ever to judge me and my house.  You see, the Bible implores us to not judge others.  It also points out, how can we talk about the speck in our brother's eye, when we have a plank in ours.  That reminds me of when Clinton was president and the republicans just brow beat him, because of his personal misdeeds.  However, here we are several years later and we are witnessing what the republicans have been doing in the dark.  For example, Connecticut's republican governor is currently on the verge of impeachment for corruption charges, then there's the representative I believe from one of the Dakotas or one of those Northern states, who was recently convicted of killing someone while driving drunk.  Then Mr. Rush Limbaugh (the grand puba himself) a self-admitted drug addict, is on the verge of divorcing his wife after 10 years.  Finally, our beloved Mr. Bush can take full credit for attempting to resolve his personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, at the expense of our military(Can you say, 'Mob Boss' - Godfather Bush).  Furthermore, they stated that Clinton lied under oath, but what do you call a President that starts a war based on nothing else but hearsay, fallacy and false pretense.  I call it 'The fleecing of America.'  I've come to the conclusion, that  it is just flat out easier to point out the faults of others, rather than fess up and take responsibility for our own shortcomings.   I don't want to end this posting on a negative note, so the bottom line is as follows: Strength is characterized by dealing with reality.  No matter how difficult that may be, it's the hand that we've been dealt.  One of my favorite cliches is  'it's not a matter of what you have, but it's what you do with what you have that's important.'   So for everyone out there, who desires to be my personal Jesus Christ, get off your cross, 'cause I need the wood.         "
"       I haven't blogged in a week, because it has been a difficult week.  However, I hope that writing today will help in clearing my mind and bring clarity to my thoughts.  Earlier this week my step daughter became ill while visiting her birth father.  So my wife and I dropped what we were doing on last Sunday and picked her up.  She had been gone for a week, which is the longest she has ever been away from us.  It was such a delight to have her back home.  I really didn't realize how much energy and vitality she brings to our lives and home.  She was having problems with her mouth, I believe it is called thrush or something like that.  Anyway, she had stopped eating and was crying because her mouth was in pain.  Also, I believe her wisdom teeth are beginning to grow in.  Anyway, when she got home we gave her a bath and made her brush her teeth.  We also fed her without a problem and we made her drink water.  She claimed that she had only brushed her teeth once while at her dad's.  Also, she stated that she had eaten a lot of candy.  Since it was the weekend, we couldn't take her to the doctor until Monday.  My wife has class every morning from 7:30 to 9:30, so I took off from work to stay with my daughter.  When my wife returned home we took our daughter to the doctor.  After that we came back home and ate.  Then, that afternoon my wife had an appointment with a pre-natal specialist.  So we went to the appointment where we found out that we're having a baby boy.  However, the doctor noticed a cloudy looking area in the baby's brain, which appears that the baby may have down sysdrome.  The news wasn't devastating, but my wife and I were concerned.  Our reaction was more of uncertainty and numbness.  We really didn't know what to say or how to react.  I guess the fact that we've experienced so much in recent times, that nothing really devastates us anymore.  It's kind of like, 'well here we go again.'  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but that's how we responded.  The doctor was going to do a test on the baby to determine if the baby has down syndrome or not, but we opted to not do anything at that time, because with the test, there is a risk for miscarriage.  However, as we were leaving the hospital, we decided that we would drop by my wife's doctor's office to see if her last blood test revealed anything indicating down syndrome.  The doctor was not in and her nurse stated that she could not speak concerning the blood test, but the doctor would have to talk to us about it.  So we scheduled a test for next week.  Also, that evening we took our daughter back over to her dad's house for the remainder of her summer visitation.  Well my wife continues to go to school, but it appears that it is really taking it's toll on her body.  She goes to bed late doing homework, then she wakes up early to go to class.  She is barely eating, and when she does she throws up.  I'm very concerned about her health, to the point that I told her that she really needs to consider dropping school for now and perhaps after the pregnancy she can resume it.  However, stubborn as usual, she is still determined to complete it.  I think the main reason she continues to go is that she is getting financial aid to go to school, and she's afraid that if she drops her class that that will negatively impact her financial aid.  But I told her that if we have to pay it back, then we'll just pay it back.  Furthermore, I'd rather pay back a couple of $100, than to risk losing you.  It has bothered me so much, that I've practically stopped eating.  I really don't eat, but once a day.  I worry all day about her, because I trully believe that she is doing too much at this time.  On Wednesday night, we had a good meal and we were enjoying the evening together, when my wife started feeling nautious.  She started vomiting, but while vomiting she strained too hard and burst a blood vessel in her esauphagus.  We didn't know the severity of it at that time, but she did start vomiting blood.  So we went to the ER and we were there for 3 hours without seeing a doctor, it was after midnight and my wife was still concerned about her homework and going to school later on that morning.  So we decided to leave the hospital without seeing the doctor.  We got up yesterday morning, my wife went off to school and I went to work.  I got a call around 11am that morning from my mom, indicating that my wife called her, stating that when she came home from school, she started vomiting and blood was once again coming up.  I called my wife immediately, and she was driving herself to the hospital.  I asked why didn't she call me and she stated that she knew that if she had called me I would become alarmed and take off from work to see about her.  She scared that I might get fired, because I take off alot.  But as far as I'm concerned a job is just a means to an end.  Therefore, I can always get multiple or subsequent streams of income, but I can't replace my family.  I didn't get alarmed, but I told her that since it was almost lunch time, I would take an early lunch and meet her at the hospital, which is only 10 to 15 minutes away from my job.  However, my wife had also contacted her best friend and her cousin and they were on their way to the hospital also.  So I decided to just go see about her during my lunch break and then I would return to work.  Well I got to the hospital and I didn't see our car in the ER parking lot.  So I began to panic and suspect that my wife didn't make it to the hospital.  I finally get inside into the ER  and I didn't see my wife, so I asked the nurse and she guided me to where my wife was.  I gave my wife a big hug when I saw her.  She was crying because she was in pain and I guess perhaps she was feeling a little guilty because we didn't stay at the hospital yesterday.  Well anyway, they got her into a room and her best friend arrived, so I literally had to drag myself back to work.  Well this morning she's feeling better, they gave her medicine and told her that she needed to rest.  We went to bed early last night, but we both woke up early, thinking that my wife had to go to school today, but she doesn't have classes on Friday.  We ate breakfast and here I am right now writing.  Also, another issue that has occurred this week, is that we were approved for a home loan with 100% financing at a decent interest rate.  However, I think we are unsure if assuming the responsibility of owning a house is something that we can do right now.  I am not one to pass up on opportunity, but there is so much going on in our lives right now, that looking for a house and preparing for that process, seems just a little bit overwhelming and ominous right now.  So I'm not sure what we're going to do.  We want a house, because our family is expanding, but whenever I think about it, all I can think about is the expense associated with it.  At the moment, I have no clue what to do.  I haven't followed through like I should with the mortgage guy and to be honest with you I haven't even been excited about it, all I'm thinking is I don't know if this is the best thing to do right now or not.  We're not even sure how long we want to live in our state.  I guess if I had to sum it all up, it has been a difficult and complex week, but we're still here and we made it through.  I'm different than I was a week ago, I guess one reason is that my birthday was this week, but that was kind of overshadowed by the events of the week.  I'm really looking for a break through, whether it is a higher paying job, my own business or what.  My optimism is probably at an all time high, but I really don't know where the breakthrough is going to come from or what I need to do to attract the breakthrough.  Anyway, no matter what happens, it sure did feel good to get all of that off my chest.  Well, I hope you have a fantastic day and a wonderful weekend.         "
"       I read an article earlier this week I believe, regarding the American Idol contestants who did not win the competition.  It went into detail about what some of them have done since the show.  It was quite interesting to hear that some have gone on to sign record deals and others acting pursuits.  Also, we may as well consider those who did not win on The Apprentice and America's next top model.  Most of us may refer to them as the losers, because they failed to win the competition.  However, there is an interesting underlying theme that I would like to discuss concerning this year's batch of 'losers.'  In my book, a loser is one who fails to try.  Unfortunately, most people don't look at it that way.  Have you ever heard of the expression 'winning is everything,' well that may not necessarily be the case if you consider the life of an opportunist.  I'll go as far as to say, you can even suck and still end up succeeding.  For instance, I believe his name is William Huong, I guess it's spelled that way, I don't know.  Anyway, he wasn't a finalist, yet ended up signing a record deal, appearing at big time musical events and if I'm not mistaken the article that I read indicated that as of that date, he had sold 38,000 albums.  In the music business that's a pathetic sales showing, but let's put it in context.  You have a guy who flat out can't sing, signs a record deal, sells 38,000 albums and we'll assume that the average CD goes for $12, which results in gross sales of $456,000.  Not bad, not bad at all for a so called 'loser,' or wait, is he an opportunist?  Opportunist, I love that word, is defined as 'one who takes advantage of any opportunity to achieve an end, often with no regard for principles or consequences.'  Moreover, opportunity, is defined as 'a chance for progress or advancement.'  Therefore, if we combine the two definitions, then we can define an opportunist as being someone who takes a chance for progress or advancement to achieve an end, often with no regard for principle or consequences.'  I'm sure Mr. Huong doesn't mind the consequences of ridicule or embarrassment that he has faced since making his way to the limelight, because what's really funny is the fact that he's probably laughing all the way to the bank.               "
"       Today is a pretty average and mundane day.  These are usually the best days for me, because I 'zone out' and start daydreaming.  (Just a little sidenote), it's amazing how when I daydream, it's almost as if I'm not physically present where I am and then it takes an outside distraction to bring me back to where I am.  Some people may think that's weird, but I see it as an awesome way to escape the daily pressures of life, rather than doing something that may be harmful to me or someone else.  Also, what I've found to be the most beneficial is how I've been able to generate ideas, accomplish feats that I didn't know that I could and also, at times, live out my dreams.    However, something that I've learned recently that may end up being a quantum leap for my life is writing down my thoughts or dreams.  Being able to come back to a previous thought and refer back to it at a later time, perhaps after acquiring more knowledge and skill can be a very powerful combination.  That's really my whole point for establishing my blog.  I've come to the conclusion that if no one ever reads my blogs, but me, that's okay, because in doing this I'm benefiting in several ways.  Firstly, I'm establishing a habit in doing something that I enjoy, which is writing.  Secondly, I'm developing content that can be utilized later for something that maybe marketable.  Thirdly, I'm overcoming my apprehension of putting information out there for others.  I guess I've always felt that no one would really be interested in what I have to say anyway.  It's kind of ironic that I think that, because I love giving public speaking engagements and I love songwriting.  I guess I take writing and sharing my knowledge and experience as being something that is very personal or almost even sacred.  But what I've found, is that is what most people like about me.  My ability to express thoughts or experiences in such a way that they themselves feel like they're experiencing or thinking it.  One thing that I strive to do with my life, is to  do whatever I do with my heart and if I'm unable to do that then I quit and move on.          "
"       Woke up this morning about 6:00am, because my wife just started going back to school as of yesterday and she has a 7:30am class.  Man, I can remember those days.  I think the 8:00am classes I had back in the day, I was absent more than I was there (I Hate Mornings).    Anyways, my wife is pregnant with our second child and today was the day that the morning sickness decided to make our day an interesting one.  I followed her to school, because I wanted to make sure she got to class okay.  We arrived at the school and I walked her to her class.  She sat for a moment then we stepped out into the hallway, because she started coughing uncontrollably.  This whole time, I knew she was also feeling nauseous, but I was encouraging her to try to keep her food down.  Well she went to the restroom and came back out, but nothing happened yet.  So we started to walk back to the classroom where she vomited right in front of the doorway.  These dudes who were standing nearby, started laughing and ran off.  If my wife wasn't feeling so sick, I probably would have hauled off and hit one of them.  The point is, the whole experience made me seriously think about  how insensitive we can be at times .  I realized that those guys were young, immature and juvenile college students.  But what concerns me, is if I wasn't there, would someone have helped my wife or not? (Sometimes our own insecurities prevent us from making significant impact on this world or just in our sphere of influence).  However, the real lesson that I learned came from my wife.  After the incident, I said 'Baby, lets just go home and you can get some rest.'  But, she said no  I got to do this , I got to go to class.  She wasn't embarrassed, ashamed or nothing.  Rather she was focused, determined and dedicated.  As I drove back home, I thought to myself, I wonder if those knucklehead boys or the others who just looked and passed on by would have half the courage and grit that my wife had.  When I spoke to her later on this morning, I told her that I admired her and I also knew that she would be successful this semester.   Bottomline , so many people are out there ' keeping up appearances ,' becoming so consumed about what others say or think about them that they miss out on considering what matters most.  That is  what do you think and say about yourself .  As far as my wife is concerned, she told herself no matter what I'm confronted with, I'm going back to school and I will succeed.         "

I've listened and read about this story all day.  People are criticizing him and everything else.  But I applaud him for realizing that in his case, football was a mean to an end, rather than an end in itself.  I really think it's wrong for people to judge him the way they have.  He's just like the rest of us, only with celebrity status.  He got tired of his job and realized it was time for him to move on.  There are those that say, but he's only played for 5 years.  Well I retired for the first time after only working for 5 years too.  At that point in my life I realized I had been living my life to satisfy everyone else, but myself.  Unfortunately, after a year and a half, I had to go back to work, because my finances were running low.  However, none of my friends didn't have 1.5 year vacation like I did.  They were still grinding away at jobs they didn't neccessarily enjoy.  So I don't blame the guy for retiring.  I wish him well.

"            Friday, March 26, 2004 I woke up quite late. I am still feeling a bit grumpy with the weather. Boy is it hot.  My girlfriend called me up early in the morning. I could not recall what she said except that she is going to march for the graduation. That is cool for at least one of us is able to finish graduate studies. I wish I could say the same for myself.  Often, I find myself wishing I were in other places, in other time, in a parallel world where things are better.  I know that I have to do something with my thesis-- and fast. I say that to myself to the ninth time. By grace of God, I know I will finish that thing probably just out of sheer persistence. I must otherwise I am in a deep fix.  Thus, I ate breakfast late. Health is something I should put more investment in. Admittedly that is not one of my strong suit. I am a slob. Well, a good one at that. I love books but I cannot seem to have all the time and the energy to read my collections. I think by now I have already thousands of books. My collection probably costs hundreds of thousands of pesos. Still, I am always short of money. Pauper, yet well feed, that is me, a walking irony, just like some of my books.  My neck also hurts. What else hurts? I could think of many sore muscles in my body. Indeed the mind is willing but the body is weak."
"           I am writing this while I am naked. Although I just took a bath, the temperature sure feels like hell.  Summer time in the Philippines is when everything comes to a standstill or at least in a slow motion mode. After all the school is off and students have already gone home. This the the season when scorching heat of the sun inflicts its brunt on everyone, many are either feeling sleepy or just plain out of energy. I am no exception. The best that I could do to make the heat bearable is to focus the fan to me and take baths as often as possible. I just wish I had an air con, however wishful thinking that may sound for I could never afford one.  Anyway a lot has happened these past few months. It is funny that I want to recollect my thoughts and the events that have transpired in my life while I am in my naked glory. Not that I look good, no siree, unless you are one of those whose fetish is to see Shrek naked, it is just that I don’t get to do this-- in fact I haven’t done this at all.  While writing this I wonder if my neighbors could see me. Just to be in the safe side, I turned off the lights. They may accused me that by parading in my entire glory I lost my sanity or is doing some satanical ritual or worse reduced myself to a pervert. At this point, I don't care what they think.  I am here because it is hot and I want to write. Period.  Awhile ago I was watching the television, and I was incensed what our current congressman said in his interview. He claimed, or he made it sound, that he was the one responsible for the many infrastructure projects in our area. For me that sounded delusional. Lest he forget, the money spent on such projects came from the people, in fact the only thing a conressman could do is allocate the people’s money, serve as a conduit and nothing more. It doesn’t take a genius to do that. The spoil system is Philippine's politics. I don’t see any reason why he should boast of such as an achievement.  While it is already hot in the Philippines, the election further ticks me off. The set of candidates we have both for local and national election are miserable, sorry excuses for human beings, if they are at all humans. Most do not know what they are running for, what they want to do, and what made them run in the first place, except, obviously, to gain power. Who cannot feel cynical about this whole charade? I cannot stomach it and dare say I refuse to accept it. I mean I can be naked while writing this but I feel extremely violated, even humiliated whenever I hear these candidates speak to toil themselves to high heavens. All words that come out of their mouths are filth, lies and deception devised for us to believe them, taking us as fools, morons, stupids, dregs. Why, I ask is it that our congressmen are obsessed with infrastructure projects when their real jobs are in legislature?   Kickbacks, anyone?  The patronage politics has led us nowhere, and it seems that this is the very carrot that they offer the voter this coming election. It is a painful reality that makes me shiver, a cold fact that jolts me out of my comfort zone and throws me into deep panic.  Election is when all that stinks is gleamed over for the unimpeachable truth that it is all a play, an illusion, when all of us are taken for a ride, and, lo and behold, we thoroughly enjoy the experience, not knowing any better, not knowing the difference of a good leadership from a bad and deceitful one. It is surreal, and by golly, it makes me feeling sick.  Elections in this country is something I hate if only for the reason that I have to agonize over its poison reality that it cannot be changed with a make believe magical wand, and that truly, no change, at least the good ones, seems imminent. The old system persists. It is a sad, sad world. There is no magical silver bullet to address this problem and sometimes finding a solution to what plagues this country is overwhelmingly futile.  Now, I know that I am sweating and naked, well, these too are also out of the ordinary. I stare at my monitor, hoping that in the end I made sense, I pray that at least I appear sensible. Never mind that my congressman is deluded, or that election in this country is a poor excuse to claim itself a democracy. Finding myself naked and alone in this room are just two of those few things I can afford to do out of sheer lunacy, say even, as my own sign of protest against these seriously dirty traditional politicians whose existence we could happily do with out.  I say in closing that the weather is hot-- but the politics in this country sure stinks like hell.            "

"           yes!!! ok, i didnt exactly ace the persons exam but at least i feel that i was able to salvage some crucial points. i had to re-write my answers many times. the questions were difficult and tricky. good thing i am a teacher, i sensed where the dean was coming from, i suspected sneakiness, so, there was no other option but to stretch my gray area and to analyze fully the questions.   some pointers here are proper. publication is essential for a law to be effective no matter what. the executive order 200 that amended art. 2 of the civil code became only effective in 1988. rights are also, in general, subject to waiver as long as it is not contrary to laws, public order, public policy, morals and good custom. in that question, i thought it proper it is within his right anyway his father already died and the waiver is not against those grounds cited. future waiver is prohibited but the right was already ripe... etc, etc.... in sum, the exam was an intellectual exercise, at least different from that statcon exam ( by the  way latin is a dead language) which left me reeling with those statutory principles(harharhar).   now to make fun of the statcon exam...  i say that atty.culling should liberally construe the answers and the instructions in favor of the students. the general rule as stated in the first part of the exam is to put  ALL  answers in the booklet. at the latter part of the questionnaire, answers should be written at that very questionnaire. talking about ambiguity. asnwers should also be written at separate pages, but what about those true and false part. waste, waste, waste of paper. point is, the instructions are ambiguous. in article 3 of the civil code it states that 'ignorance of the law excuses no one'  but tempered with the concepts of mistake of fact( exempting?) and mistake in the interpretation of the law( mitigating). statutory construction is fun, my golly, it makes me deliriously insane.   another thing, the teachers seem to like this for i dont know what reason. they said that they would give some objective items, but lo and behold, almost all was essay questions. as to the coverage, the dean said only until article 34 of the civil code, but why include article 36? it is abuse of rights( art 19,20, 21). i wonder if i file a case againts these teachers the case is justiciable? see what this stupid law school is doing to my mind.   and did i ever mention the grammar. forget it, i refuse to incriminate myself. :P  noel, how many dinners do you owe me now? i am not talking about libis here, just good food man.  i miss joy. we were together in sseayp. she married a korean so she is now in korea. yesterday was nanay's bday( my national leader). i sent her a text. she should get married by now. i was also not able to go to cavite yesterday to visit the new batch because of the exam. well, hopefully next week i could go with them.  i enjoyed my jog around amoranto stadium last night. i am planning to buy a ball so that i could play basketball in there. jogging unstress my system. it is fun, cheap, and healthy. food intake is a bugging problem. sigh. at least i am going somewhere, as to where, well, as they say only God knows.    laws are for the stupid people. people are stupid. that should make us all happy.  Ah, the humanity.                  "
"           last night i was stuck in traffic for two hours. literally my butt was in pain. i saw two people who get into a heated argument because of a traffic altercation. i hate it when people flare up or become unreasonable. i arrived at the house almost 10:00 pm. feeling all weary, i tried reading my civil law books in vain. i fell asleep at 11:40 pm.  my life today centers around marriage. well this is the content of exam. i will read more after this blog spot doodle.   i feel distressed when i see young people smoking. isn't there a law that prohibits selling cigarretes to minor? it seems  though that this law is ineffective for apparently no one cares. according to this law cigarette vendors should be situated at least 200 meters away from the university/school. obviously this law is also in reality non-existent. i ask what are laws for if not properly observed or implemented.   dura  lex sed lex my foot!     unlike in singapore where laws are strictly implemented, here in the Philippines there is wanton disregard for the law. when i was in singapore last year i was conscious of not violating any law for the fines were exorbitant. imagine paying $500 dollars for littering.  in the philippines we treat the entire street as a vast trashcan. throw your refuse at will. anyway one could never find trashcans. this is the price of uncurbed democracy.  anyway smoking for the youth really ought to be properly regulated. also when i was walking home i saw children sniffing rugby. where is the dswd? those children are the future of our land, and look where they are now. indeed the situation is quite pitiful. i feel bad knowing that the lives of these children are wasted. why is it that we, more often than not, simply ignore them, treat these children as mere vagrants and nuisance, just dirty and burdensome dregs of society. maybe they are, i thought to myself, and one reason is probably because we allow the situation to persist. we are oblivious. we treat these people as if they are invincible. but the poor, the dirty and the marginalized are constant fixture in our society and something must be done to help alleviate their problem. hallow words do not amount to anything.    'something must be done', and i say that to myself convinced that at the moment what i say are mere words lacking in action.                 "
"           curses!!!  i mean ok i didnt do as well with my freaking statcon subject. shame is on me for refusing to memorize the dead language--latin terms--costing me, i hope not, and god forbids, 20 darn points for this exam.  just some thoughts. why is it that erasures are forbidden and by golly the instructions the teacher gave was-- of all irony--ambiguous. the questionnaire said all answer must be in the booklet but later on he said that we should instead encircle our answers and write it on the questionnaire. well, teachers are human too, i should know, i used to be one. is this karma? hehehe. anyway, suffice to say i enjoyed again answering the essay questions. i am not sure though with the question concerning the franchise and the tax law. i put in my answer that the franchise is controlling. although what was said in the franshise law was 20% while the tax code asked for 20% gross sale, i think effort to harmonize the two would result to double taxation. oh i am torturing myself with this.   tomorrow is civil code day. i hope to do better in this subject. tonight i am going to stay late reading. at least i only have two more subjects to go, after that i could enjoy myself once more.  drew asked for a picture to be submitted tomorrow for sseayp tour guides. he just texted me yesterday. i am pressed for time and i need some break.i am thinking if i cant submit the picture to forego the opportunity to serve as tour guide for this year. i promised myself to attend the ship reception dinner though. i miss sashimi and miso soup. i miss the unlimited ice creams and sake. i miss saying ohayu. and maybe this time i would really go to grand bath naked and frolick with all those uncircumsized PYs.           "
"           legal writing is normally bad writing. reading cases makes my head spin. most legal decisions are just awful, save of course decisions penned by isagani cruz. why is that? i guess the intent is to mystify the law, make it sound esoteric so that normal people would end up with a numbing head ache, and thus leave all the legal deciphering to lawyers. honestly, why not call a spade a spade directly without resorting to inefficient and ineffectual legalese? why not say white when the color is white, and not anymore slip to mumbo jumbo bullshit that really is just specious and stupid. i wish they cut all the crap, make it all simple, in that way more could appreciate the law.   i remember one said that in law school if you cannot dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bullshit. maybe there is a need to speak straight yet with substance. in that way we could do away with statutory construction.          "
"           i have an upset stomach. this is cool. for lacking any of other words to say i guess i am reduced to an imbicile.... which is not the first time. tonight, i will start reading the civil code. i am not really that concern too much with statutory construction, not because it is hard, but because, well, i dont have time to worry for it anymore. some of the cases in statcon seem easy to understand( save the radiola case which took me 4 times of reading before i finally got what all the fuss was all about) it is just that it seems that atty. culling  further muddles the issues when in discussion. he is good, by all means he is, it is just that does he intentionally make it appear more difficult? remember this is an opinion of a slave( err, a student) so this is not of any importance at all. i invoke my freedom of speech with this one if people are raising their eyebrows. i console myself with a sight that at least i am learning, even if this is the hard way.  To toil for the sake of learning is the price i must pay.            "

"           the exam yesterday was quite a surprise. one need not study the provisions or cases, one simply should know a bit of literature and philosophy, plus, of course, a flair for writing. fortunately, i think at least i have a knack for those.  i wrote 14 pages in single space for my answer. it was a treatise i know. but then the question in the exams were themselves long and literary(sic). in short, it was an essay, an exposition of one's view, a polemic of sorts, which, honestly i enjoyed because i did not memorize. well, it is now done and over with so i have to study for my other subjects.  what grade will i get, que sera sera.  i am now again in the library. i decided to come here because the sight of my bed is too inviting to resist. at least here, i hope i am right in this, i could resist closing my eyes. anyway i just have to make the most of out of it and do my best.  funny that the question in poli centered around a certain character whose name was quixote. maybe gorospe has a running battle against his 'own percieved' windmills. i wonder who is his appointed amuse?   :) interesting.

"           stupid. that is what i call myself at the moment.  i thought that today, monday, the uniform for the day is blue. so it was to my surprise when i arrived in the library that i noticed that most were wearing white. my god, i wore the wrong color for monday. considering that we were told during orientation that there would be 10 point deduction for improper uniform, there was nothing for me to do but to rush back to my room in roxas and quickly changed.  right now, i am back in the library. i guess stupid is what i really i should call myself today. my fingers are crossed that i would have a better luck for my exams later.  ciao          "

"           Adriene,  I love your essays and I could easily relate to most of your experiences,especially those that have hints of angst. Keep it up. I love reading your works so much I make it a point to access your website whenever I have the chance.   Another thing, I would like to dispel your idea that no one misses you. Yeng and I do miss you, big time. As I have said, I haven’t seen anyone yet who could compete with your infectious smile, those wide grin that makes your eyes almost invisible. Even until now, in my memory, I could still picture how you smile. Call me biased, well, admittedly I am, but next to the Petronas Towers, your smiles should be declared as another national treasure. Truth is, I remember Malaysia fondly not so much with its nice sceneries, yes those too were quite impressive, but more than anything, it is the warmth and the friendship that you, Raymond, and the rest of the MPYs extended to us which made Malaysia quite dear to our hearts.So, much are we separated with distance, for what it is worth, we miss you.   Youalways  have friends here in the Philippines, and we would love to have you back anytime--but hopefully in the soonest time possible.Take good care of yourself. And I heard that you are celebrating your birthday. Hmm. That makes both of us Aries. :)Cheers,Chris          "

This got my mind working, however, not in the sense the church probably wished it would. The closer to God, the smaller things seem to be...hmmmm... Let's assume God in this statement is the imaginary guy in the sky with the gray beard and white dress.

"        well let's start the blog with a rundown of what happened this past weekend.    For all those who weren't there here's what happened.  I was invited to a beach themed party at joe's place in new bedford.  I find out around midnight or so that my car was picked up and moved into the street by 7 teenage guys and towed thereafter.   After talking with a few officers at the station, the tow company, I had to shell out $95 yesterday for the tow just to get my car back.  As it turns out, I have a relative who has AAA and it looks like I can get a refund for the tow.     I'd like to give my thanks for all those who were there and helped:    Maura (taking the time and trying like hell with AAA and such), Joe (providing the couch and pullout bed), and Amanda    (for being sweet, putting up with me being goofy and for the excellent shoulder massage).  Even with the shit that went down with the car, the night turned out pretty decent.  I got to spend some time with Amanda, which was cool, even if we stayed up until 6 am.  Anyways, I had a full weekend with a nice surprise, some fun and except for the car thing, would live through it again in a heartbeat.  Thanks everyone for reading this and if I'm not lazy, there may be a couple more entries this week.                     "

"   It has been a week since the passing of President Ronald Regan.  Seven days have been filled with bitter sweet moments and memories as this nation says farewell to one of our heroes.  These are grounding moments of reflection for the country and for us as individuals.  They give us pause for self-evaluation and they provide for us a window of insight into the impact one man can have on the world.  True heroes are rare.  Ronald Regan was one of my heroes.  Regan contributed heavily to the image I hold in my minds eye of what true leadership looks like.  It has been a privilege to be reacquainted with much of those images over this past week.  His departure from public life left an empty stage upon which he has returned for a final farewell to a nation that loved him. Those who aspire to great things are lucky to have lived after Ronald Regan. He left for us a clear example of the value and importance of passionately working to improve the world.  Reflection on Regan's life yields to those who are searching, a sure way in which to affect lasting and valuable change.  I believe the late President would have advised those of us who are planning to lead this country forward to chiefly and genuinely care about our fellow man and to passionately pursue those things that are righteous and true.  The political stage needs more candidates who have the strength to do so.  Regan's strength and the example he set should be a model for us all, it demonstrates the impact of living a life of true purpose.  Let this lesson be one which resonates within our hearts and inspires us to do the same.   "

Grooms © 1997   In an 1856 letter to his wife Mary Custis Lee, Robert E. Lee called slavery 'a moral and political evil.' Yet he concluded that black slaves were immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially and physically.  The leftists who predominate in the mass media and the world of academe have refashioned the by gone world of slavery and black life in the Old South. Their agenda does not allow for a balanced view of a world they never knew.  In a society molded by highly skewed and agenda-selective presentations of history, the tightest censorship involves the fact that large numbers of free Negroes owned black slaves; in fact, in numbers disproportionate to their representation in society at large. In 1860 only a small minority of whites owned slaves. According to the U.S. census report for that last year before the Civil War, there were nearly 27 million whites in the country. Some eight million of them lived in the slaveholding states.  The census also determined that there were fewer than 385,000 individuals who owned slaves (1). Even if all slaveholders had been white, that would amount to only 1.4 percent of whites in the country (or 4.8 percent of southern whites owning one or more slaves).  In the rare instances when the ownership of slaves by free Negroes is acknowledged in the history books, justification centers on the claim that black slave masters were simply individuals who purchased the freedom of a spouse or child from a white slaveholder and had been unable to legally manumit them. Although this did indeed happen at times, it is a misrepresentation of the majority of instances, one which is debunked by records of the period on blacks who owned slaves. These include individuals such as Justus Angel and Mistress L. Horry, of Colleton District, South Carolina, who each owned 84 slaves in 1830. In fact, in 1830 a fourth of the free Negro slave masters in South Carolina owned 10 or more slaves; eight owning 30 or more (2).  According to federal census reports, on June 1, 1860 there were nearly 4.5 million Negroes in the United States, with fewer than four million of them living in the southern slaveholding states. Of the blacks residing in the South, 261,988 were not slaves. Of this number, 10,689 lived in New Orleans. The country's leading African American historian, Duke University professor John Hope Franklin, records that in New Orleans over 3,000 free Negroes owned slaves, or 28 percent of the free Negroes in that city.  To return to the census figures quoted above, this 28 percent is certainly impressive when compared to less than 1.4 percent of all American whites and less than 4.8 percent of southern whites. The statistics show that, when free, blacks disproportionately became slave masters.  The majority of slaveholders, white and black, owned only one to five slaves. More often than not, and contrary to a century and a half of bullwhips-on-tortured-backs propaganda, black and white masters worked and ate alongside their charges; be it in house, field or workshop. The few individuals who owned 50 or more slaves were confined to the top one percent, and have been defined as slave magnates.  In 1860 there were at least six Negroes in Louisiana who owned 65 or more slaves The largest number, 152 slaves, were owned by the widow C. Richards and her son P.C. Richards, who owned a large sugar cane plantation. Another Negro slave magnate in Louisiana, with over 100 slaves, was Antoine Dubuclet, a sugar planter whose estate was valued at (in 1860 dollars) $264,000 (3). That year, the mean wealth of southern white men was $3,978 (4).  In Charleston, South Carolina in 1860 125 free Negroes owned slaves; six of them owning 10 or more. Of the $1.5 million in taxable property owned by free Negroes in Charleston, more than $300,000 represented slave holdings (5). In North Carolina 69 free Negroes were slave owners (6).  In 1860 William Ellison was South Carolina's largest Negro slaveowner. In Black Masters. A Free Family of Color in the Old South, authors Michael P. Johnson and James L. Roak write a sympathetic account of Ellison's life. From Ellison's birth as a slave to his death at 71, the authors attempt to provide justification, based on their own speculation, as to why a former slave would become a magnate slave master.  At birth he was given the name April. A common practice among slaves of the period was to name a child after the day or month of his or her birth. Between 1800 and 1802 April was purchased by a white slave-owner named William Ellison. Apprenticed at 12, he was taught the trades of carpentry, blacksmithing and machining, as well as how to read, write, cipher and do basic bookkeeping.  On June 8, 1816, William Ellison appeared before a magistrate (with five local freeholders as supporting witnesses) to gain permission to free April, now 26 years of age. In 1800 the South Carolina legislature had set out in detail the procedures for manumission. To end the practice of freeing unruly slaves of 'bad or depraved' character and those who 'from age or infirmity' were incapacitated, the state required that an owner testify under oath to the good character of the slave he sought to free. Also required was evidence of the slave's 'ability to gain a livelihood in an honest way.'  Although lawmakers of the time could not envision the incredibly vast public welfare structures of a later age, these stipulations became law in order to prevent slaveholders from freeing individuals who would become a burden on the general public.  Interestingly, considering today's accounts of life under slavery, authors Johnson and Roak report instances where free Negroes petitioned to be allowed to become slaves; this because they were unable to support themselves.  Black Confederates and Afro-Yankees in Civil War Virginia (University Press of Virginia-1995) was written by Ervin L. Jordan Jr., an African-American and assistant professor and associate curator of the Special Collections Department, University of Virginia library. He wrote: 'One of the more curious aspects of the free black existence in Virginia was their ownership of slaves. Black slave masters owned members of their family and freed them in their wills. Free blacks were encouraged to sell themselves into slavery and had the right to choose their owner through a lengthy court procedure.'  In 1816, shortly after his manumission, April moved to Stateburg. Initially he hired slave workers from local owners. When in 1817 he built a gin for Judge Thomas Watries, he credited the judge nine dollars 'for hire of carpenter George for 12 days.' By 1820 he had purchased two adult males to work in his shop (7). In fewer than four years after being freed, April demonstrated that he had no problem perpetuating an institution he had been released from. He also achieved greater monetary success than most white people of the period.  On June 20, 1820, April appeared in the Sumter District courthouse in Sumterville. Described in court papers submitted by his attorney as a 'freed yellow man of about 29 years of age,' he requested a name change because it 'would yet greatly advance his interest as a tradesman.' A new name would also 'save him and his children from degradation and contempt which the minds of some do and will attach to the name April.' Because 'of the kindness' of his former master and as a 'Mark of gratitude and respect for him' April asked that his name be changed to William Ellison. His request was granted.  In time the black Ellison family joined the predominantly white Episcopalian church. On August 6, 1824 he was allowed to put a family bench on the first floor, among those of the wealthy white families. Other blacks, free and slave, and poor whites sat in the balcony. Another wealthy Negro family would later join the first floor worshippers.  Between 1822 and the mid-1840s, Ellison gradually built a small empire, acquiring slaves in increasing numbers. He became one of South Carolina's major cotton gin manufacturers, selling his machines as far away as Mississippi. From February 1817 until the War Between the States commenced, his business advertisements appeared regularly in newspapers across the state. These included the Camden Gazette, the Sumter Southern Whig and the Black River Watchman.  Ellison was so successful, due to his utilization of cheap slave labor, that many white competitors went out of business. Such situations discredit impressions that whites dealt only with other whites. Where money was involved, it was apparent that neither Ellison's race or former status were considerations.  In his book, Ervin L. Jordan Jr. writes that, as the great conflagration of 1861-1865 approached: 'Free Afro-Virginians were a nascent black middle class under siege, but several acquired property before and during the war. Approximately 169 free blacks owned 145,976 acres in the counties of Amelia, Amherst, Isle of Wight, Nansemond, Prince William and Surry, averaging 870 acres each. Twenty-rune Petersburg blacks each owned property worth $1,000 and continued to purchase more despite the war.'  Jordan offers an example: 'Gilbert Hunt, a Richmond ex-slave blacksmith, owned two slaves, a house valued at $1,376, and $500 in other properties at his death in 1863.' Jordan wrote that 'some free black residents of Hampton and Norfolk owned property of considerable value; 17 black Hamptonians possessed property worth a total of $15,000. Thirty-six black men paid taxes as heads of families in Elizabeth City County and were employed as blacksmiths, bricklayers, fishermen, oystermen and day laborers. In three Norfolk County parishes 160 blacks owned a total of $41,158 in real estate and personal property.  The general practice of the period was that plantation owners would buy seed and equip~ ment on credit and settle their outstanding accounts when the annual cotton crop was sold. Ellison, like all free Negroes, could resort to the courts for enforcement of the terms of contract agreements. Several times Ellison successfully sued white men for money owed him.  In 1838 Ellison purchased on time 54.5 acres adjoining his original acreage from one Stephen D. Miller. He moved into a large home on the property. What made the acquisition notable was that Miller had served in the South Carolina legislature, both in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, and while a resident of Stateburg had been governor of the state. Ellison's next door neighbor was Dr. W.W. Anderson, master of 'Borough House, a magnificent 18th Century mansion. Anderson's son would win fame in the War Between the States as General 'Fighting Dick' Anderson.  By 1847 Ellison owned over 350 acres, and more than 900 by 1860. He raised mostly cotton, with a small acreage set aside for cultivating foodstuffs to feed his family and slaves. In 1840 he owned 30 slaves, and by 1860 he owned 63. His sons, who lived in homes on the property, owned an additional nine slaves. They were trained as gin makers by their father (8). They had spent time in Canada, where many wealthy American Negroes of the period sent their children for advanced formal education. Ellison's sons and daughters married mulattos from Charleston, bringing them to the Ellison plantation to live.  In 1860 Ellison greatly underestimated his worth to tax assessors at $65,000. Even using this falsely stated figure, this man who had been a slave 44 years earlier had achieved great financial success. His wealth outdistanced 90 percent of his white neighbors in Sumter District. In the entire state, only five percent owned as much real estate as Ellison. His wealth was 15 times greater than that of the state's average for whites. And Ellison owned more slaves than 99 percent of the South's slaveholders.  Although a successful businessman and cotton farmer, Ellison's major source of income derived from being a 'slave breeder.' Slave breeding was looked upon with disgust throughout the South, and the laws of most southern states forbade the sale of slaves under the age of 12. In several states it was illegal to sell inherited slaves (9). Nevertheless, in 1840 Ellison secretly began slave breeding.  While there was subsequent investment return in raising and keeping young males, females were not productive workers in his factory or his cotton fields. As a result, except for a few females he raised to become 'breeders,' Ellison sold the female and many of the male children born to his female slaves at an average price of $400. Ellison had a reputation as a harsh master. His slaves were said to be the district's worst fed and clothed. On his property was located a small, windowless building where he would chain his problem slaves.  As with the slaves of his white counterparts, occasionally Ellison's slaves ran away. The historians of Sumter District reported that from time to time Ellison advertised for the return of his runaways. On at least one occasion Ellison hired the services of a slave catcher. According to an account by Robert N. Andrews, a white man who had purchased a small hotel in Stateburg in the 1820s, Ellison hired him to run down 'a valuable slave. Andrews caught the slave in Belleville, Virginia. He stated: 'I was paid on returning home $77.50 and $74 for expenses.  William Ellison died December 5, 1861. His will stated that his estate should pass into the joint hands of his free daughter and his two surviving sons. He bequeathed $500 to the slave daughter he had sold.  Following in their father's footsteps, the Ellison family actively supported the Confederacy throughout the war. They converted nearly their entire plantation to the production of corn, fodder, bacon, corn shucks and cotton for the Confederate armies. They paid $5,000 in taxes during the war. They also invested more than $9,000 in Confederate bonds, treasury notes and certificates in addition to the Confederate currency they held. At the end, all this valuable paper became worthless.  The younger Ellisons contributed more than farm produce, labor and money to the Confederate cause. On March 27, 1863 John Wilson Buckner, William Ellison's oldest grandson, enlisted in the 1st South Carolina Artillery. Buckner served in the company of Captains P.P. Galliard and A.H. Boykin, local white men who knew that Buckner was a Negro. Although it was illegal at the time for a Negro to formally join the Confederate forces, the Ellison family's prestige nullified the law in the minds of Buckner's comrades. Buckner was wounded in action on July 12, 1863. At his funeral in Stateburg in August, 1895 he was praised by his former Confederate officers as being a 'faithful soldier.'  Following the war the Ellison family fortune quickly dwindled. But many former Negro slave magnates quickly took advantage of circumstances and benefited by virtue of their race. For example Antoine Dubuclet, the previously mentioned New Orleans plantation owner who held more than 100 slaves, became Louisiana state treasurer during Reconstruction, a post he held from 1868 to 1877 (10).  A truer picture of the Old South, one never presented by the nation's mind molders, emerges from this account. The American South had been undergoing structural evolutionary changes far, far greater than generations of Americans have been led to believe. In time, within a relatively short time, the obsolete and economically nonviable institution of slavery would have disappeared. The nation would have been spared awesome traumas from which it would never fully recover.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  NOTES   1.

They weren't slaves any more than the approximately 4,000 white indentured servants working out their loans for passage money to Virginia, and who were granted 50 acres each when freed from their indentures, so they could raise their own tobacco.  Slavery was established in 1654 when Anthony Johnson, Northampton County, convinced the court that he was entitled to the lifetime services of John Casor, a negro. This was the first judicial approval of life servitude, except as punishment for a crime.  But who was Anthony Johnson, winner of this epoch-making decision? Anthony Johnson was a negro himself, one of the original 20 brought to Jamestown (1619) and 'sold' to the colonists. By 1623 he had earned his freedom and by 1651, was prosperous enough to import five 'servants' of his own, for which he received a grant of 250 acres as 'headrights.'  Anthony Johnson ought to be in a 'Book of Firsts.' As the most ambitious of the first 20, he could have been the first negro to set foot on Virginia soil. He was Virginia's first free negro and first to establish a negro community, first negro landowner, first negro slave owner and as the first, white or black, to secure slave status for a servant, he was actually the founder of slavery in Virginia. A remarkable man.'   ______________________________________________________  "

I get to work in the morning, take care of my immediate responsibilities, and set into reading the news for the day. It's a sort of Daily Journal Staff Ritual, just short of a policy. They want us salesfolk to stay up on the news, I suppose, since we are a newspaper and all. So, while my co-workers are looking through today's paper, I'm running through the Dixienet.org news page, Dave Black Online, DixieInternetCo, the Drudge Report, WorldNet Daily, Freedom Watch, and a good dozen other like-minded news sites to see what's really goin' on in the world around us.   Most every morning, I see things that I want to share with my folks out here in email land, (aka: yall) and I've taken to sending it out as a blanket email with links to the more important news stories along with whatever little update on the Constitution Party of Mississippi, (CPoM) or the Upper Mississippi League of the South (UMLoS ) I have to share for that day. I enjoy doing this, and I hope yall enjoy gettin' em. I've even come up with a semi-pompous name for it - MBR's Morning Sedition, using my initials to make a pun on  urlLink  NPR's Morning Edition  - that early-morning, soft-voiced liberal noise pollution on Public Radio.   Just about everybody on my email list is getting this email right now. However, I know there are those on this list that dont feel like getting this email from me on a semi-daily basis is a good thing , and yall break down into basically 3 catagories: 1.)'I love ya Matt, but you can stick that UMLoS and CPoM stuff where the sun dont shine' folks, 2.) 'I dont care about news and I'm sick of you trying to tell me about it' people, and 3.) I already go to the LoS Dixienet.org news page, Dave Black Online, DixieInternetCo, the Drudge Report, WorldNet Daily, Freedom Watch, etc. and it's redundant for you to be sending me this' folks. If you fall into one of the above catagories, reply to this email with 'unsubscribeMBR' as the subject and I'll make sure to pull you from the email list - no hard feelings.   For the rest of you, welcome to the beginnings of the UMLoS / CPoM listserver. Now here's the news that ya aint gonna git nowherred else 'cept fer rat cheeyunh.  _________________________________   News Links:      Bush's Own Gettysburg Demise is Coming: The State of Pennsylvania on November 2nd   -  Pastor Mark Dankof   http://www.dixieinternet.com/page222.shtml      Home Schooling Grows, Federal Bureaucrats Worry  -  Al Benson Jr.  http://www.dixieinternet.com/page230.shtml  Now I want yall to listen: Ronnie Brandon has been saying it for a long time now - they aint gonna let us teach our own kids for much longer without some kinda fight. - MBR      Keyes: Obama holds 'slaveholder's' view  -  AP Wire  http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/keyes09.html God bless Alan Keyes as he attempts to knock ' Osama' Obama and his his multicultural relitivism out of the national lovefest limelight! - MBR      Politically Incorrect and Proud  -  Offending with the Truth  http://michnews.com/artman/publish/article_4611.shtml 'Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?'

Constitution Party of Mississippi Update:  http://www.constitutionpartyms.com Our Old-Fashioned Southern BBQ and Political Rally this past Sunday was an absolute success, and people are STILL fired up from it state-wide.

Check it out tomorrow for the info.    I noticed when I got back to work on Monday and looked at my little desk calander from the Freedom Forum, Saturday the 7th's quote was purty dead on.   'It is but a short step from the banning of offending symbols such as burning crosses or burning flags to the banning of offending words.' - Rodney M SMolla, constitutional scholar, 2002   Upper Mississippi League of the South:   I am in the process of having business cards and small, professional-looking info cards made for the purpose of giving to all the men I see wearing or displaying the Confederate flag on their teeshirts, cars, tattoos, etc. This is from a brainstormin' session me and Ronnie had one night about how to reach all the 'Dixie Outfitters' crowd for the League, and I encourage each of you to do the same. (Let's get together on the actual copy and design of the cards so that we can avoid contradiction and maintain a certain stylistic approach.)  I think these will be an invaluable recruitment tool for us in a part of Dixie where Proud Southrons are ripe for the pickin', but bear in mind we will have to be prayerfully discerning when approaching folks. Keep in mind, the average Joe Six-Pack with a half-nekkid woman and the words 'By Gawd I'm a Rebel' on his teeshirt and the 'Let's get a rope' guy with a white sheet sticking out of his trunk are likely not going to fit the description of the morally strong, honourable Christian Southerner that we want to build the League with. Yall smell what I'm steppin' in?  Contact me about the card idea and let's get these thangs made. ___________________   See yall tammary -   -   Matthew B.
