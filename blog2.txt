"                  Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string.  Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.                     "

"       august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out, leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here, smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself, i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to, i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to, i hate ties, i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to, i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now.

"             Today I watched the public opinion concerning to child labour in the country. I learnt that most of the people are against the child labour and all are emphasizing on children education rather than forced labour. Of course, I agree that, eduction is first rights of any child. But what I think is children who are doing hard labour are forced to work for themseleves. They get involved in such act due to poverty and responsiblity towards their parents & their youngers. Most of such children are from those backgrounds, where they have to support their home.  Now next part is - people exclaims that government should look after such act and ban child labour and forced work. They should be admited to school for education. The point is, if they don't work, how they could manage to make money for food, cloths and shelther?  People futher adds that government should facilitate expenses to educate them. I still agree that the only sector that could solve this problem is - government who is responsible for protecting this human rights. Now, again the question is - how could government arrange such budget untill and unless you pay tax to the government? Our tax is the only source of income to the government, which is how they expedite money in country's development.  So, I guess that, root cause of this problem and solution starts from each citizen. If we are loyal to the government system, I am sure such activities can be eradicated from the country within next 10 years of period.           "
"             I was talking with my friend online one day, and he said something about he had to go delete some files because a web site had uploaded his whole hard drive. I told him that was impossible, because it would take months to upload gigabytes of information on a 56K connection. He said he had gone to a web site that had a link saying something like, 'I have your hard drive, check it out,' and it pointed to C:\. It took me an hour to convince him that no one had uploaded his hard drive.          "

"             GMail security flaw: I just discovered a rather serious security flaw in Google's a href='http://www.gmail.com/service, currently in beta. If I wanted, right now, I could access the mailboxes of at least a dozen people, alter their user information, send e-mail using their address and otherwise generally fuck up their accounts.   I won't, of course. But if someone as essentially tech-clueless as I can do it, I rather imagine more savvy and unscrupulous parties are ready and waiting to exploit this weakness.  Further: It's not a technical flaw with the GMail system. It's a combination of poor user interaction design and a little social hacking that opens up the system to potential abuse.  I was poking around the  urlLink  site, just to see if by some miracle they'd opened sign-ups and not told anyone. (They haven't.) But I clicked on everything that I could, including the link under the login panel asking 'Forgot your password?'   That takes me to a page where I'm asked to 'enter the email address you use to login.' At random, I picked the address of a friend I knew had recently obtained a GMail test account and submitted it. I then had to pass one of those tests where a graphic of a word or nonsense phrase is displayed and you have to type it into a box to prove you're a human and not a computer.  After doing that, I'm presented with a security question, presumably one chosen by the GMail user to further verify their identity and help them recover their password. This is where the system starts to break down. Several people have custom questions, unique to them and requiring somewhat intimate information about themselves. In the case of the random friend's account I'd plugged in earlier, it was something I knew about them off the top of my head. If I didn't, though, I'd easily be able to ascertain the answer by reading their website.  I gather that 'What is your Mother's maiden name?' is one of the default security questions. It's a bad one. In the case of at least three friends, I didn't know it but was able to easily obtain it by plugging their names into, yes, Google and having the information spit back to me from publicly accessible genealogy websites.   Now having a security question isn't a bad thing, per se. It's just not very tight security, particularly when many of the people using the service are, themselves, web publishers and have chosen particularly poor questions with easily researched answers as the key to their account. But it still requires a little effort; it's not as though a simple computer program could batch through dozens of accounts and compromise them. It requires a thinking, Googling human to get past the security question.   Ah, but when you do! In other systems, passing this hurdle would generate an e-mail to a second account, either revealing the password or containing instructions for resetting it. With GMail, though, I'm immediately presented with the option of resetting the password. Input a new password twice, click submit and voila: I'm in charge of another person's account.  This makes GMail extremely insecure.   There are two ways to address this. First, if you're using GMail right now, I'd suggest choosing a security question to which only you know the answer and which is not answerable by Googling for information about you. (Good advice always, but particularly in this case.) Mothers' maiden names are right out. Names of first pets? Suspect, when a lot of us have taken and published the results of 'What is your drag queen name?' quizzes on our websites. Old phone number? Probably tucked away in a long-forgotten, never-updated online database.  The second is for Google to tighten up the process by requiring password changes to involve an e-mail challenge or some other means of resetting an account password. Knowing a person's GMail address and a little personal info about them is too low a hurdle to put the reset mechanism front-and-center where it is now.   At last count, I could easily compromise the accounts of six friends, six prominent webloggers, a Google employee and one random fellow I've never met or heard of.  I haven't and I won't. And another Google employee has graciously invited me to take a test account, which offer I'll accept, even though I wish the service worked with Safari so I could really get under the hood.   In the meantime, I won't be trusting GMail for anything critical and I'll be picking a completely unanswerable (except by me) password security question. I'd advise you to do the same.         "
"             Edging closer to a direct confrontation with Microsoft, Google, theWeb search engine, is preparing to introduce a powerful file and textsoftware search tool for locating information stored on personalcomputers.Google's software, which is expected to be introduced soon, accordingto several people with knowledge of the company's plans, is theclearest indication to date that the company, based in Mountain View,Calif., hopes to extend its search business to compete directly withMicrosoft's control of desktop computing.Improved technology for searching information stored on a PC will alsobe a crucial feature of Microsoft's long-delayed version of itsWindows operating system called Longhorn. That version, which is notexpected before 2006 at the earliest, will have a redesigned filesystem, making it possible to track and retrieve information in waysnot currently possible with Windows software.Google's move is in part a defensive one, because the company isconcerned about Microsoft's ability to make searching on the Web aswell as on a PC a central part of its operating system. By integratingmore search functions into Windows, Microsoft could conceivablychallenge Google the way it threatened, and destroyed, an earlierrival, Netscape, by incorporating Web browsing into the Windows 98operating system.A Google spokesman declined to comment about the new search tool.Although Google's core business rests on huge farms of servercomputers that permit fast searching on the Internet, the company hasalready taken several steps to move beyond that business.Last year, Google began testing a free program called the GoogleDeskbar that makes it possible to search the Web by entering words andphrases in a small dialog box placed in the Windows desktop taskbar atthe bottom of the computer screen.Google also sells a computer search system designed to index andretrieve information created and stored by a single organization.   There is a rich history of less-than-successful attempts to create\information search tools for personal computers. In the 1980\'s, for\example, Mitchell Kapor\'s On Technology developed On Location for\retrieving information on Macintosh computers and Bill Gross, a\prominent software developer, led a group of programmers to create\Lotus Magellan for the PC.\\Digital Equipment\'s Alta Vista search engine group also developed a\search tool for data stored on desktop PC\'s. Today there are a number\of commercial products for desktop searches like X1 and dtSearch.\Moreover, both the Macintosh and Windows operating systems have file\and text retrieval capabilities.\\The Google software project, which is code-named Puffin and which will\be available as a free download from Google\'s Web site, has been\running internally at the company for about a year.\\The project was started, in part, to prepare Google for competing with\Windows Longhorn, which according to industry analysts will dispense\with the need for a stand-alone browser.\\The disappearance of the Web browser and the integration of both Web\search and PC search into the Windows operating system could\potentially marginalize Google\'s search engine.

Microsoft believes that\Longhorn users will no longer think about where information is stored;\they will instead see a unified view of documents stored on both the\Internet and on the desktop.\\The looming confrontation between Microsoft and Google is coming as\Microsoft prepares to introduce its own advanced Web search service.

"              Abu Dhabi:    I kept an eye out for the Arabian Sea even as we flew over the craggy, bald mountains of what I thought was a bit of western Pakistan under the blazing noon sun. The projection screen set up for the entertainment of passengers on the Gulf Air flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi, kept warning of the searing heat outside, while some fellow passengers curled up in blue blankets of airlines issue. The sense of unreal that struck me at that moment kept recurring throughout our whistle-stop visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. As we approached the city of Abu Dhabi, the bleakness of landscape was punctured only by what appeared to be whimsical attempts at block building. Postage-size smudges on the endlessly stretching sand, looking more like rubbed-out sketches of a child, suggested human attempts at habitation. All this however changed the moment, our aircraft taxied into the Abu Dhabi terminal. We were met by a bevy of smartly attired women in slanting caps brandishing walkie-talkies. A neatly primed up gentleman with pronounced South Indian accent in his English, guided us through the duty-free shopping zone.  The 12 of us who had flown from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi, courtesy Gulf Air on a familiarisation trip, were soon overwhelmed with the attention and sleekness of the airport and its services that reflected sadly on our good old Tribhuvan International Airport. After a bite of superb dates and better coffee, we were shown around the marvels of the famed duty-free area. One of the marvels included a million dollar scratch-and-win opportunity for a lucky traveller who succumbs to the charms of shopping there. The more practical ones amongst us quickly latched on to a bottle or two that were clearly cheaper by about Rs 400 to Rs 500 per litre than the going price in Kathmandu. To the utter disbelief of our liberal Nepali friends, who found it out a bit too late, liquor could only be bought in Abu Dhabi city if you have a licence and are lucky enough to locate an outlet.  Soon the 90 per cent humidity and 44 degree Celsius heat drove away such impious thoughts.           "
"             What led Edison to light up our lives? What allowed DaVinci to accomplish so much in such different fields? How was Gates able to develop the Windows program? How can we be more creative and innovative? We can do it by learning to cultivate our creativity, another key success factor.   Thinkers such as Edward De Bono, Tony Buzan, John Kao and Mauro Rodriguez Estrada believe that creativity is the ability to generate ideas, to see opportunities where others see only problems, to break out of the limiting boxes of our traditional way of thinking and to do something more original, quick, effective, profitable, aesthetic, functional, practical, productive or ecological.   It’s not just for artists   Although creativity is considered a quality related mostly with the arts and culture due to its obvious connection with painting, sculpture, writing and drama, this skill is also crucial in the business, academic and political sectors. Everyone needs a certain amount of creativity to succeed.   If creativity is the ability of create new things and innovation is the ability to transform these ideas into goods, products and services that meet the needs of a specific market, our challenge is to become creative and innovative.   To be creative, we do not need to be geniuses. Creativity is within reach for all of us.   We first need to prepare ourselves. We must have the knowledge, attitudes and skills required to be creative. We must know how to generate ideas and must have the desire to generate them, demonstrating that desire when we encounter a problem or a conflict situation.   We can be creative at home, in decorating our houses, preparing a new dish, designing spaces or organizing activities for our families. We can be creative at work, generating new procedures, new ways of doing things, new products or new services. We can be creative in society, finding better ways to live together, finding original solutions to problems that arise in our community.   Break out of the Box   Here are some of the recommendations from creativity experts:   1. Take a course or workshop on creativity. Learn what motivates you to want to be creative.  2. Change your normal daily routine to stimulate mental, emotional and physical flexibility.  3. Use colors and images in your note-taking and communications. Colors and figures stimulate your imaginative mental processes.  4. When you encounter a problem, ask yourself, “What is the solution that I am not seeing?”  5. Ask others. People who are outside a critical situation can usually see things that we don’t, so they are able to see alternate solutions.  6. Play another role. How would you solve this problem if you were a homemaker, an investigator, a mechanic, a pilot, or a doctor? Changing your role forces you to think in a different way and to consider new options.  7. Learn to play. Play establishes the mental and emotional conditions needed to produce ideas.   We have defined creativity as a skill that can be learned. We have seen that creativity is not only for artists, but also for educators, business people and executives. We have learned how to initiate the simple, but effective process of basically exercising our creativity. Now we only need the humility to learn more about this magic function of the brain and the courage to dare to act differently.   Source : JCI International         "
"             What led Martin Luther King, Gandhi, John F. Kennedy, Margaret Mead, Simón Bolivar, José Martí, Nelson Mandela and Bill Gates to become great leaders? How did they achieve their goals in the way they did? What allowed them to excel? If we examine their qualities and skills, we can incorporate them into our lives and take another key step towards success.   Harvard professor Howard Gardner performed a study on several recognized leaders in various fields such as politics, business, science, religion, academics and art. He shared the results of his investigation in his book Leading Minds, in which he identifies the conditions for exercising exemplary leadership.   Gardner points out that in any society, few human beings become effective, exemplary leaders, yet without effective leaders a society cannot remain viable. Gardner offers an explanation of the problems that surround the development of leadership and insights into how best to nurture and sustain it effectively.   In order to achieve exemplary leadership, every leader must have the following:   1. A Story: This is the message the leader shares based on the vision of the future. It must be inspiring, ambitious, achievable and detailed.   2. An Audience: This is the group of people that the leader gathers around himself or herself to share the story.   3. An Organization: This is the institution or organization that will give continuity to the leader's actions, even after he or she is gone.   4. Expertise: The level of competence that a leader must demonstrate with regard to the role he or she plays within the organization to give life to the story.   5. Embodiment: The degree to which the leader is consistent with the requirements of his or her story.   6. Influence: The way in which the leader influences others. Influence can be applied directly or indirectly or through a mix of the two.   What is your story? Who is your audience? How large and how sound is it? Does your organization endorse your dream, your vision, your story? How competent are you in the areas required by your story? To what extent do you practice what is preached in the story you share with others? How do you influence them? Do you do it in person, face to face, or do you do it through the example of your work? Do you combine your personal contact with effective work?   Answering these questions will help you become aware of the type of leader you are and how close you are to exercising exemplary leadership in JCI as well as in your family, profession or political group.   We see fewer and fewer exemplary leaders committed to developing themselves and committed to helping others. We need men and women who have the courage to take on the challenge of being exemplary leaders, the type of leaders who, in the words of Joel Barrer, 'take us to places where we would never go alone.'   source : JCI International         "
"             In the past, employees have been permitted to make trips to the restroom under informal guidelines. Effective August 2004, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of employees. Under the policy, a 'Restroom Trip Bank' will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given a Restroom Trip credit of twenty (20) trips. Restroom Trip credits can be accumulated from month to month. Within two weeks, the entrances to all restrooms will be equipped with personnel identification stations and computer linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of December, each employee must provide two copies of voice-prints (one normal and one under stress) to the material department. The voice print recognition stations will be operational but not restrictive for the month of August. Employees should acquaint themselves with the station during that period.If the employee's Restroom Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restroom will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper toll retractors. If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty seconds after the alarm sounds the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.

"             As a mobile user I am still very amused when people call on my phone and ask “Where is this?” This is a common practice with land lines. I can’t help being amused over how people can ask this question. I usually tell them this is Putalisadak but in 10 minutes this will be Ratna Park.         "
"             I still remember the day when one of my distant relatives for the first time bought a cell for himself. Two years back when the first phase of sim cards were distributed he too got one for himself. These new things were very expensive at that time and only a few could afford it. In those days people who owned mobile phones considered it a symbol of high financial status so this relative of mine had become a subject of conversation in his locality. But now things have changed. From street hawkers to officials and political leaders enjoy this mobile facility. Earlier those who owned the mobile phone drew people's attentions but it's vice versa these days. One funny thing I have noticed among the mobile phone users is that their phones often remain switched off. Many a times it also has happened that we call someone on his/her mobile and the person after viewing the telephone number on their screen switches it off without replying. Such pathetic behaviour of people compels us to draw a conclusion that mobile phones are more of a luxury then necessity.         "

"       Well, this is a stretch for me- Mrs Tech-Challenged 2004! I must be out of my mind to start this, but then again I have been called crazy more than once in this life! I don't know how much I'll have to share so bear with me! I know that I will try not to be unfair to any person in my scope of friends- and will not spread gossip or slander anyone !

"       Once again- for your giggle gene- My Friday Funny. Have a laugh my friends, it's better that a pill ( & this I know a little about lol) &nbsp;&nbsp; As &nbsp;I &nbsp;Mature........ As I mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  &nbsp;I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or big boobs.  &nbsp;I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!  &nbsp;I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it  &nbsp;I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. &nbsp;&nbsp;Pass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they'll appreciate it. Who knows, maybe Something good will happen. If not...tough shit.  &nbsp;P.S.&nbsp; Thanks &nbsp;Janine! Have a great Day- Love KC     "
"       My day off, which means house work. God, I hate it!&nbsp; I usually work until 10:30 on Tuesdays, so the Hubby is home alone with the kids. Which is all right, he's great with them- but more often than not the house winds up getting trashed, while he is watching CNN in the bedroom! Then I have to clean up the 'aftermath' GRRRRR! &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that it's fair that the one day off during the week, that I would normally use as 'my time' I.E. web-surfing, gardening, reading , errands etc. should be taken up with cleaning the house for the second time in the week! ( Sunday is my cleaning day- top to bottom) I work all the rest of the time. I just did this shite 3 days ago! There are 5 people in this house damn-it! Why am I the only one that thinks toys all over the livingroom and 10 dirty glasses strewn around are upsetting??? Socks everywhere and HEY- a pair of size 4 toddler undies under the coffee table??!! Jeez- what happened last night? Or do I want to know????  &nbsp;&nbsp; What is that old comercial- 'Calgon- take me away!!!!............ lol !     "
"       All right, I know it's been a few days since I've been here- the truth is I didn't have anything of interest to say. That is, until I logged on last night and read the news..... &nbsp; A new man is now at the helm of Island records. At first I thought- so what? Just another corporate wonk to annoy all of us Lep fans. But after reading the article ( 3X, might I add) I've come to some conclusions. ( agree or disagree in my comments, I love a good debate!) &nbsp; 1- He seems to have come up the ranks from D.J.&nbsp; to Boss. This to me says he is a 'music lover', as opposed to a Businessman (accountant, paper-shuffler - you all get my drift, right?) &nbsp; 2- The fact that of&nbsp;ALL the 'established' artists that are managed by Island, He specifically mentions DL in the article makes me have hope!  &nbsp; 3- The release of LLWTG- FINALLY! Better late than never, perhaps. But if he liked the song alone- wouldn't he have released Lionel Richies version? After all, that would be promoting a record which has just been released- as opposed to one that has been concidered ' dead in the water' for a while now. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know that I may be 'blowing smoke' here, but I can't help feel that this is a good sign for the days to come. and the fact that our beloved guys are eligible for the 'R&R hall of fame' as of 2005 ( you all know how I feel about THAT- and if you don't , see my tag line on the forums!;-) ) Having someone like him at the helm of the ship may just mean smoother waters ahead for our band.&nbsp; JMHO- And you'll forgive me if I hope that I'm right on this one! Cheers all, KC :-)     "

"       I know, I haven't been here lately- but I had a good reason. Lightening hit the power pole in back of my house, which took out our power &amp; cable. I&nbsp;got the power back within a day, but the cable ( and my internet) took longer. There are times I wonder why these essential services are still above ground, and not in buried cables. After all, between hurricanes and Florida being the 'Lightening Capitol' of the U.S., it would make sense,Huh? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just when I thought things were getting back to normal, #2 child ( Andy) comes to me this morning with an earache. So off to the Dr. we go!! $20 at the dr. , and $50 dollars for the drops for his ear!!! I guess its P.B.&amp; J. sandwiches for me 'til payday!!  &nbsp; Hope you all are well, and I did manage a little time to get the links fixed ( sort of- lol) I'll get this web- crap eventually!

"       OK, after blowing off some steam, I though I'd try to get some links up. Well, they are not right again! though 3 of them are showing,I put in 6, and if you move the curser over one of them- 2 web addresses show up! GRRRRRRR! I really need to take a computer course or something. Any advice would be appreciated, since this is my 100th attempt, and I don't see anything wrong with what I put into the template. Ok, I'm gonna get off this thing for awhile- before this moniter winds up being a lawn ornament! Tata for now!    "
"       Or Pissed or whatever! I got home last night from work and immediately my Hubby got in my face- ' why didn't you make the car payment??!' I did! I mailed the frigging thing Friday,the 2nd. Well, they haven't got the darn thing yet!!!!  It was due last saturday ( at the latest) and I mailed it the day he got paid!    This bank I have my car loan through is supposedly a highly respectable institution, but the problem is they are based in North Carolina- NOT Florida! the closest branch of this bank to me is 2 hours drive. They have a web-site, but no payment options ( unless you have an account with them ) and you can not make a phone payment either ( unless your pymt. is 10 days LATE!!???). And this is the bank that the 3 biggest car dealerships in this area use for car loans!WHY!?? I can pay any of my other bills on line/over the phone with no problem. Even my local water company will take payments over the phone ( po-dunk town that I live in!) BUT NOT this upstanding institution!    So now, after talking with the rep from said bank, I will wait until this Friday, and if the check has not been recieved, they will call me and THEN take my payment over the phone. And I will have to pay the $30 fee to put a stop-payment on the check I sent, or end up paying twice ( which I can not afford!) Jeez- this Sucks! Off to throw a few pillows or something to vent! KC     P.S.- I am still tying to get you all linked up- I put the link section in, but the sites I have entered are not showing. Give me a little time to figure it out- I will get it done!      "
"       Today my eldest is turning 14. Though mothers are supposed to love all their children equally ( and I do!) this one holds a special place in my heart. I know, you all think- she's your first, that's why. But no, that's not it. You see, a mother gives her children life- but Becky has returned the favor.      ( flashback) 12/27/2002- 9:30 pm. I had just goten home from work. Tired, but no more so than any normal day. Becky was up and asked if she could have ice cream. I remember saying that if she could get it herself, she could have it. The next thing I saw was some strange lady washing my hair. I was in the hospital, apparently having just had brain surgery. An Aneurysm that would have ended my life except for 1 thing. BECKY. She was there, and I have since learned, called 911, her dad, and gave me her breath to keep me alive. I would not be here if not for her. I love my daughter.      Hug your child ( or anyone's child- they're all special) It might be the best thing you do! Happy Birthday Rebekah Leigh Fine! I love you! Mom :-0    "
"       One good thing about working  at the same job for a long time is that vacation time increases. I get a total of 4 weeks a year, and this is one of them! Tommorrow I'm off with my kids to Ocala, Fla- home of my good friend Janine. She's the one who put up living with me ( no easy task, I assure you!) in College. That she still thinks of me as a good friend after some of the lame-ass bull I did in school is truly a testament to what a great person she is! I hope that I have matured enough to make me more bareable now! Maybe I can get her to take a pic or two to put up later. And maybe I'll show her this blog- she'll be the first! And maybe she know's how to get the comment system working on this blasted thing. Michael tried, but the instructions are in tech=speak, and I am clueless as usual! Oh, and one more thing- Congrats to our favorite singer, on his upcomming nuptuals! He's picked a good day ( if the news is true ) I aught to know- It has been my wedding anniversary the last 20 years - Lep love, KC              "

"       A talking frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He sees right away from her window nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack. (He can read, too.)  'Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a holiday.'  Patty looks at the frog in disbelief. In staying with the bnk policy pertaining to customer relations, she kindly asks him his name.  The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, adds the fact that his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay to give him a loan because he knows the bank manager personally.  Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral. The frog says, 'Sure. No problem. I have this,' and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about half an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.  Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and says, 'There's a frog at my window who says his name is Kermit Jagger, he claims to know you, says his dad is Mick Jagger, and wants to borrow $30,000, AND he wants to use this as collateral.' She holds up the tiny pink elephant.  'I mean, what in the world is this thing?'  (You're gonna love this).....................  (It's a real treat)......................  (Masterpiece)..............................  (Wait for it).................................  The bank manager looks back at her and says......  'It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone.'  (You're singing it, aren't you?!!! - I knew you would.)     Just a funny to end a long day! Thank's to my cousin Patti for this one! Have a good one! KC in Fla    "

"       Because I finally got a chance to wear my adorable new grass green slicker from  urlLink  Urbn.com  .   Good Good Weekend - all the important things were covered - a little bit of politics, a whole lotta dancing and libations, and some mad manicure and pedicure action.   Watched a show on the Travel Channel about new things to do in Vegas so we are now making plans to go to  urlLink  Ice  , the hottest and coldest bar on the Strip. I know, I know, at this point you're wondering - How can a club be both hot AND cold?  Well, my friends, I'm going to be honest - I don't really get it either.  But it has something to do with liquid nitrogen and a temperature drop of about 30 degrees.  Just don't tell my parents where we're going as I'm sure they'd be concerned that the sudden change in temperature will cause us all to catch cold.   My mom has already begun bombarding me with her now infamous 'Don't set your drink down' (DSYDD) speech. Since I was a pretty thoughtful teenager I think I may have actually listened to her had she not prefaced 'DSYDD' speech numero uno with 'Last week on 'Walker Texas Ranger', there was this girl at a club with a drink...'  Sorry mom, but any kind of behavioral lessons usually go unheeded once you bring Chuck Norris into the fold.   I had a whole slew of links I wanted to direct people to but for some reason 'Walker Texas Ranger' has distracted my very fragile attention span. Ah wait, I think they're coming back.  Further proof that I am the original celeb trendsetter continues to develop.  First, on a recent shopping trip I referred to myself as 'the Paris Hilton of Target.'  Now, a new Target just opened in Brooklyn to a  urlLink  celeb-studded party   featuring a certain friend of mine's fave indie girl, Maggie Gyllenhaal.    Next, what is up with all the celebrity break-up chaos?  First it was me and a certain Yellow Rat Bastard and now it's  urlLink  Kirsten & Jake   and  urlLink  Paris & Nick  ...who will be next???  A couple of side items that make me giggle a wee bit.   First of all, I just have to say that even though the New York Post is not exactly a safehouse of accurate journalism, I still think they are a really fun read.   Maybe they are having so many problems this summer because the majority of their staff is in the Hamptons writing up the Hamptons Diary and this other column which could basically double for the barhopping adventures of any city, but since it's in the Hamptons is somehow supposed to matter.  Today's  urlLink  article   is about a dude who sold his shirt for a $100 to gain access to a crowded hot spot.   Finally,in honor of my weekend of double entendres and XXX-rated Mad Libs, click  urlLink here   to see a really classy headline from Reuters News Service about MTV network's new gay channel, Logo.              "
"       In an effort to atone for the less than positive attitude I've been having lately, I just want to take some time to list some of the things that have made me smile in the past few days  &nbsp;  My thanks and gratitude go out to......    Hilary Duff for making a movie so bad that Rolling Stone called it 'upchucky'    The scheduling department at 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest' for booking Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G. on the same day as Richard Simmons   The meter maid for giving me the standard $15 parking ticket rather than the $55 citation that I usually get   The Director of Catering at the Renaissance Hotel for being just late enough for our 1:00 lunch appointment that I spotted Jeff Goldblum in the lobby   The Starbucks barista in Cleveland who gave me a free&nbsp;extra shot in my Iced Grande Skim No Whip White Chocolate Mocha   Barnes and Noble for always having an empty seat by the window   Bravo for showing a ' urlLink Blow Out ' marathon every Sunday afternoon   All my fabulous friends who are all just as screwed up as I am but consistently take time out of their busy schedules to validate and console&nbsp;me                "
"       Hm, I've been trying to post something for the past two days but it seems like I only get the initiative to blog when I need to be doing a million other things - like reading Mrs. Dalloway for Lit class or writing a four page essay on symbolism in WWI poetry.   I really don't want my blog to be a catalog of my pet peeves but it's been one of those days. And my top annoying item of the day would have to be people getting angry for no good reason. For instance, there is a guy in my class who gets almost personally offended anytime our professor lectures on formatting our papers according to MLA format.  I certainly understand it's boring but why all the sighing, moaning, and shuffling of books?  In my opinion, people should really reserve that kind of righteous indignation for things that are truly wrong - like  urlLink Lindsay Lohan   getting a recording deal,  urlLink Joan & Melissa Rivers defecting from E! to the TV Guide channel  , and Jessica Simpson's mom in the recent issue of  urlLink Vanity Fair  claiming that Jessica's IQ is 'like,160. And, you know, that's like a genius level.'   Ah, so much celebrity bashing to do, so little time.    Okay well since I kind of disparaged Miss Lohan, I guess my props for today will go out to Hilary.   (I'm very bipolar when it comes to my adoration of teen celebrities.....)         "
"       Just when I thought that hard news was dead and The Daily Show was the last bastion of journalistic integrity, CNN restored my faith in the media with their in-depth, hard-hitting article on the issue that everybody has been worrying about -  urlLink  How will Frat boys vote ?   Notes from the typing pool.....  Days away from my promotion (or so I hope) from the wacky world that is Administrative Assistance, a brief journey on the web revealed that secretaries don't just inspire stereotypes - they also inspire art! Just check out this  urlLink  clip  from a writer for the  urlLink Conan O'Brien show .  One would think that a promotion on the horizon would actually make me WANT to work but instead I've been spending even more time than usual on-line, fearful that a REAL job with REAL work involved will mean much less time spent catching up with Page Six and La Dolce Musto.      Hilary or Lindsay?    Mm, I was thinking it might be Hilary - she does have that new movie coming out next week about Cinderella and what not. And I have to give her a few extra points for the fact that her sister was in Napoleon Dynamite. But when I saw her on Jay Leno the other night she wasn't very funny and made a couple too many jokes about Jay being 'old.'  Sorry Miss Duff, but I'm just not feeling the old fart jokes from a sixteen-year old. Today's props go to Lindsay!           "
"       Unless you've been living under the proverbial rock that may or may not be da Burgh, you're well aware that there is a new radio station in town.   93.7, formerly WBZZ which was formerly B-94, is now 93.7 K-Rock, official Pittsburgh home of the Howard Stern show.   Now for those of you that are pro-Stern as I am, you will have already set your alarm clock to the channel, anxiously anticipating the morning you'll once again awake to Howard, Artie, & Robin.  Right now, K-Rock is in the process of defining their playlist which would explain why the past four mornings I've been awakened by the Cure, Led Zeppelin, and Billy Squier among other eclectic and highly annoying acts.   For those of you all about the rock, I strongly recommend visiting the following site and answering the 200+ survey that will help the station tailor their format to listener requests.  My friend Amy and I just filled it out a mere five minutes ago, our only comment was a three line plea for Tenacious D & the White Stripes.

"       Is it just where I happen to work or do UPS deliverymen in general tend to roam about in gangs? Every day from about Noon to 2:00pm, five local UPS men form an impressive posse outside the building where I work.  Normally they stick to the group of benches along Fifth Avenue, but lately I've noticed them moving about freely - a vision of brown in matching shoes, shorts, shirts, and hats.  Yesterday I saw them at the newstand fraternizing with one of the Airborne Express deliverymen.   Mr. Airborne looked slightly intimidated by all the 'brown.' He mostly kept to the periphery of the group, looking over the shoulder of his faded gray shirt as they headed up the hill. Along the way, another man in a ketchup stained Wendy's shirt joined them. Might the 'Uniforms' be planning to mount a take-over?  Or do I just have too much free time on my hands during my lunch hour?            "
"       Just wondering why people do any of the following things:   Send drunken text messages   Tell me what I should write about or how I should manage my career. If I hear one more person at work tell me how they once began writing a romance novel or that I should start sending love stories into Redbook, I will seriously scream.    Tell me to smile.   Unless they are complimenting my shoes, I really wish random men on the street would never utter any of the following phrases - 'You'd be real pretty if you cracked a smile' or 'Hey honey, it ain't that bad.'  Well, for once I'd like to tell them that yes honey, sometimes it is that bad.               "
"       Despite what celebrities may lead you to believe, breaking-up isn't all S&M photo shoots, press releases to US Weekly and concentrating on your musical reunion with the Backstreet Boys.   For the peons like myself, this breaking-up stuff is hard work. Sure, I may look like I'm living it up with my new Chanel sunglasses and plane tickets to Vegas but I'm empty on the inside. Empty like the money pocket in a certain Gucci wallet that I happen to own. I've been very open with the possibility of selling my wallet on E-bay.  So open that one of my co-workers brought in a digital camera today. Now, armed with real photos that can be uploaded onto e-bay in a mere matter of minutes, I'm faced with the very real possibility that I will finally begin purging myself of Yellow Rat Bastard (YRB) for good.   In theory it sounds like a great idea. YRB had no problem letting go of me, so why am I having such trouble getting rid of a wallet?  I've already emptied it out and put it back into its original box, but still its tugging at my heart.   And even though I had the option of leaving it at home today, I still dragged it with me in my already heavy purse. When you're involved in a long-distance relationship, there are certain things that you do to help you feel closer to your significant other. For me, it was never just a wallet - it was a symbol of our relationship.  A symbol of the fact that for once in my life somebody actually thought I was so special that I deserved my very own $400 designer wallet.  I guess to some people it wouldn't seem very important, but to somebody like me who grew up thinking that happy meals & Barbie clothes were outrageously expensive and the JC-Penney's Christmas catalog was the height of luxury, the idea of owning a $400 dollar wallet was one thought I'd never even entertained. As I think about the wallet now, YRB inevitably turns back into OREB (Overly-Romanticized Ex-Boyfriend).   OREB was so thoughtful.   He told me that I deserved that wallet.  That I shouldn't settle for anything less.  And now I look at it like it's some kind of cruel joke, a bitter reminder that maybe he was lying all along.  Oddly enough we ended up talking about the wallet during what would become one of our last conversations. I was telling him an anecdote about my afternoon and how I had dumped the contents of my purse onto the floor at a computer store when I was unable to find my car keys.   There at the feet of three kind Russian men, I tried not to cry as I fumbled through my belongings looking for the keys that I would later find in my back pocket.  As I searched through the crumpled Kleenexes, tattered bus schedules and receipts, unopened bills, sticky bottles of lotion, broken tubes of lipstick, pens, pencils, and a hodge-podge of candy wrappers I thought about one of the first lessons I'd learned in my Fiction classes this year - that the best way to reveal a character is through minor details such as the contents of their cupboards, cars, and even purses.   I thought about the fact that I carried this heavy bag with me everyday but now that I was seeing what it contained it all seemed so foolish. Everything was basically garbage, nothing of note, nothing to set me apart.  The only thing it seemed to say was that I was too lazy to clean, completely frazzled and disorganized, but somehow or another had landed a beautiful wallet that looked out of place beside all the clutter in my life.  Now I worry if I give away that wallet, what will I be left with? Will I be proud of the strength it will take to finally move forward and let go of OREB?  Or will I be letting go of the one thing in my life that really meant something just to make a few quick bucks?   So now I pose this question to all of you my friends(yes, all three of you) - when it comes to the wallet, Should it stay or should it go?              "

"             I got an early phone call from a good friend and we talked about relationships and stuff, and how things could changed in just seconds, which made me wonder about life..my life. Sometimes, life can be so perfect, when everything seems to be just right and you feel like you can't ask for more because you already have what you want. We are blinded by happiness without thinking about what's gonna happen next. When we fail or when something bad happens, we start blaming ourselves for no reasons. We feel like we're stucked in one position and we can't move on. Or maybe it's us who don't want to move on? That's probably because we're not ready. And I don't think we'll ever be ready for everything.    Sometimes you just have to accept for what you get in life, either it's good or bad. We should just enjoy the good and learn from the bad. Should people be afraid to hope or to reach for something? I don't know, I feel like I don't really want to give too much hope anymore. We live in this world to gamble and from what I've been through, I think there's no need to be afraid. But before we make efforts, we should probably be prepared about what the result's gonna be like. Again, it's easier said than done. But, hey..it's worth a try.             "
"             Can lovers stay friends after going through a painful break up? I don't know the answer to that. Some people say yes, but some people say no. Well..it's easier said than done.   When two people with different characters are in a relationship, they are trying to learn about each other to make their relationship works. They become bestfriends and even like a family. You feel comfortable when you're together and feel like you're missing your other half when he's not around. You don't have to worry about what he thinks about what you're gonna wear or even your most embarrasing behaviors, because you know that you are loved very much. Just to hear his voice from the other end of a phone call is like a pain reliever after a long day at work. Just to receive a short text message on your cellphone from him has made your day. Just to see your instant messenger blinking with his name on it can make you happy, because you know that he's thinking about you.   However, shits happen here and there. You can never predict them. The thought of loosing my very bestfriend and soulmate..has never occurred to me since the past three years. You can lie to everybody about your feelings and pretend like nothing happen, but deep inside you know, you're hurting.   My friend once said that people need to be strong in this situation because the pain is not over yet. It will keep coming back and haunt you on every little step that you make, every minute, every day. Again, it's easier said than done. But I guess he has a point there. There's nothing much to do, except to believe that it all happened for a reason. You learn from the situation, which can make you a better person everyday.   When the worst it's over, I know that things will go back to normal. Although it would not be as perfect as it was before.             "
"             Did you guys see that  urlLink nip/tuck   show on FX earlier? I thought it was so disturbing, but I kept watching it anyway..hehe. Plus Julian McMahon (Dr. Christian Troy) is so gorgeous!! I think this show is different from the other plastic surgery shows such as the one from MTV or the Swan, because they add more 'drama' in the story, which makes it more interesting. Can't wait to see more of it next week.  Today I had a training for my second job, and it started at 9am until 4pm. It was so tiring! We had to walk around campus and went to advocacy offices to get information and learn about their programs. We also had to do a lot of activities like scavenger hunt and a bunch of games. And 'luckily', it was pretty nice outside. It was really..really hot and sunny. Oh well, let's just hope it stays.  Tired..tired..tired..tomorrow I have to get up early again to work and do a lot of other things.. sigh . Nite, all!           "
"             Welcome to Colorado..It is the second day of Summer, but it doesn't feel like summer at all!! The weather has been really gloomy for the past couple of weeks. It's always raining and the sun only comes out once in a while. Today in Fort Collins is 55F and it will drop tonight to 45F. The weather here is very 'unusual', because sometimes the weather can be really nice and sunny, but it can change very dramatically at night. Or it can be snowing the next day. I remember last year we had a very big storm after Spring break, so we actually got a two-week break from school!! That was nice, but I didn't like 'the walking in the snow' part. It's slippery and wet. No thanks!  Anyways, I just got home from work and feel like writing something on my blog. I've been working for 8-12 hours a day for almost everyday. I've been really busy. But, hey..I kinda need the money anyway, so that's alright. I have two jobs this summer, one in the dining service and one in the housing service on campus. I work in a dining hall for the students who live in a dorm. Basically what I do is just serving food or swiping their meal cards. It's not really bad. My second job is pretty easy and fun. I work for this organization called  urlLink CREATE  . My job is to create bulletin boards, posters, and display cases with different themes every month. They will be put inside the campus' dorms and apartments. We also organize and create events, which I always enjoy doing. I guess thanks to 'redlight'.   I didn't take any classes this summer, so I can work a lot. But still..I have to finish my research proposal for my thesis. It's almost done, but I'm still too lazy to finish it. I decided to do a research on 'The Ethical Issues of Downloading Music via the Internet.' Do I download music? Yes..hehe, why do we have to buy music CDs if they are available on the Net? I guess I shouldn't be saying that.   By the way, yesterday was father's day, so  'Happy Father's Day'  to all dads!! I don't know why we don't have father's day in Indonesia. We have hari ibu on December 22 and hari anak-anak on July 1, but we never celebrate hari bapak. Why is that? Don't you think that your dad needs appreciation too? That is so weird. I want to get my dad something. I already know what he probably wants, but don't know when I can give it to him, because I don't really want to send the gift by mail. First, it's too expensive. Second, I don't want to lose it in the mail.   Anyway, I found this really sweet quote on the Net:   a father is someone that  holds your hand at the fair makes sure you do what your mother says holds back your hair when you are sick brushes that hair when it is tangled because mother is too busy lets you eat ice cream for breakfeast  but only when mother is away he walks you down the aisle and tells you everythings gonna be ok   -Unknown      Enjoy your night, everyone!!          "
"             Yay!! We're going to see fireworks at City Park, tonight. I hope it's not gonna rain again tonight, because it's kinda cloudy right now. But it's alright, it will be fun..fun..fun!! Finally, today's my first day off after working like crazy for the past two weeks. This morning I got a chance to have a cup of Starbucks' breakfast blend coffee with two slices of bread with chocolate sprinkles. Yumm!! And finally, I got a chance to go to sleep last night without having to set my alarm. I spent my morning by just sitting around in front of my computer, browsing, waiting for my bid at ebay to end, and chatting with  urlLink Mur  who's still having fun in Jakarta!! I 'envy' you!! I also talked to A-lie, one of my bestfriends since forever, on the phone today. It felt good to talk to her again. Actually, we laughed more than we talked!! I think the only people who can understand our jokes are us. We often lost touch, but we're still very good friends!! We talked about lots of things and came up with why people always ask sensitive questions to others such as virginity and sex. Those are like  'pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang kurang penting untuk dibahas ke orang lain.'  Those are like something that..I think we should just keep to ourselves. Like in Friendster for example, lots of those bulletin boards questions are about these subjects. And of course, no one will really be honest about their answers. It's just dumb!   Anyway, I'm thinking of moving to DC, which is where she lives right now, after I graduate, to apply for that broadcasting job that we're talking about. It sounds like a fun job, and it will be a great experience for me if I want to get a similar job back home. We'll see. I still have a year to go anyway.    My weekend? So far so good. Me and some friends went to see Spiderman 2  on Friday. It was good!! I like it better than the first one. Yesterday, I had to wake up early at 6 A.M. to work (yes..I work on weekends) and spent my afternoon with friends. We went to Whole Foods Market, a new organic store in town. It was really crowded inside the store and everything was so expensive!! After that, we had some Japanese food in downtown for dinner. As usual, me and Puma ended up at my place, watching the Food network channel. It was an okay night.  How's your weekend?            "
"             Just a little update from me. Nothing much going on lately. Still, I've been busy with work and stuff. Weekend doesn't feel like weekend anymore. I kind of miss the old times when I was still in Jakarta. Weekend seemed really fun. On Friday night I usually go out with friends.. kadang2 mencoba tempat2 baru..hehe . I remember when I was in high school, if we didn't have school on Saturday, we always went to new york cafe to watch the Groove on stage..hehe..they always knew our crowd, because we're all girls..hehe. On Saturday night we usually  'nonton midnite.'  And on Sunday, I usually go out for lunch or just to 'socially drink' coffee at the mall with my parents..hehe. Gosh, I miss home so much.  Last weekend (Fri-Sat) I had to go for a one night retreat. It was alright. I had fun, until I discovered that my room was full of bugs!! We finally moved to another room (which was nicer than the first one hehe), because we decided to not sleep with bugs flying around the room. What we did on the retreat was pretty much team building and playing games. The highlight of the retreat was when we got to do the drumming for diversity training. It was awesome..we could choose any kinds of instruments from drum to tambourine, and we just started playing them for more than two hours. We could all feel the energy that came out from the instruments. It was fun! The next day we all just felt exhausted and ready to go home. We stopped at dairy queen for ice cream on the way home..yumm!!   Hmm..what else..I got home two hours ago from eating out with puma and went to Walmart to buy some stuff. I didn't really wanna go at first because it's 'Nip/Tuck Show' day..hehe..but I went anyway and got home on time to watch the second show.   Hmm..I guess that's pretty much it. Tomorrow is another new day at work. How's your day people?            "
"             The weather sucks. It's cold and cloudy in July.&nbsp;Today is around 57 F and&nbsp;I think it's gonna rain again tonight. Oh well!! I just got home from work. I was sent home early because they have too many people. I asked my manager if I could go home and he said the big YES. Yay!&nbsp;But..I have nothing to do now. Maybe I'll just take a nap later :P     Anyways, yesterday me and my friends went to see Bourne Supremacy. (Did you see Bourne Identity? Well, this is the sequel). We went there around 6 p.m. to catch the 7:15 show. We knew that there's gonna be a long line, because it's the first day it came out. When we got there..it was sold out!! Even the 7:45 show. Gosh, I thought we were early. We should had used  urlLink Fandango . Then, we decided to go to&nbsp;another theatre, because we really wanted to see the movie. And..yay..We got the tickets. After the movie, we went to chili's for dinner. I ordered a cup of my favorite soup there, enchiladas soup, and buffalo wings with bleu cheese. Hmm..Yummy!!   It was a great night and an A+ movie. Matt Damon is so gorgeous in his black long coat. I think I like&nbsp;this movie&nbsp;better than the first one, although I don't really remember the first one..hihihi. Can't wait to see the third one! I heard that there's gonna be the sequel to  I, Robot  too .  Hmm..that will be interesting to see.   It's saturday afternoon..I'm not sure what to do tonight. All my friends are still at work. Tomorrow I have to get up really early again to work for 12 hours from 6:50 a.m. Isn't that great??   How's your weekend so far?             "
"              I just got back from work and it's raining..again. It's been like this since this afternoon. I got a split shift at work today, so I got a chance to take a nap..hihihi. Anyways, my week has been going well. I pretty much work during the day and just hang out or eat out with friends. Here in Fort Collins, we have a lot of restaurants, but there aren't that many variety of food. Maybe I'm just bored with all the food. But one restaurant that keeps going up in my favorite list is Jeju. It's a Japanese-Korean restaurant, located in downtown of Fort Collins. They have a really good food there, from sushi to tempura to Korean barbecue. Hmm...Yummy. The atmosphere is also really nice. It's more like a loungelike with a nice light setting, where you can here Jazz and blues music. It's not like an Asian restaurant at all. Here in Fort Collins, we also have a lot of local owner coffee shops. I've only been to one of them, and it was..alright. Still, Starbucks is way much better.&nbsp;Many people here, well..maybe in the other states too, they're not really a fan of Starbucks and its monopoly power.&nbsp;What's with that anyway?&nbsp;So what,&nbsp;they have a good coffee, and they're making a lot of money from it.&nbsp;I found this Web Site about  urlLink Why do I hate Starbucks?  This guy..or gal came up with numbers of reason why he or she hates Starbucks:    The majority of the coffee is grown using underpaid third world labor.   Starbucks is spreading the world like a virus, infecting cultures with their formula of what a coffee shop should be.   They are everywhere.   They have predatory business practices. Doing things like paying landlords to not renew leases for coffee shops so that they can move in.   They sell fake corporate responsibility.   I think that their coffee sucks. It is always bitter.   The gross profit margin per store is, on average, 59.1%, this is money that could easily be lost if they paid more than a dollar a pound for coffee. (read: livable wage for their slave labor)   Faux ecologic responsibility.    What do you think? Maybe some of them make sense, but I still love drinking their coffee anyway. And...they say that you will feel the Starbucks experience when you drink their coffee. I agree..whatever that means!    &nbsp;Anyway, me and my friends had been wanting to see I, Robot. So, yesterday, after I got home from working long hours,&nbsp;the four of us&nbsp;went to see I, Robot. It was awesome, I like it a lot. It will be scarry though, if that's how 2035 is gonna be like..hehe, but maybe it will be really cool to have a robot at home.   There are lots of good movies at the theatre that I haven't seen. And more good movies are 'coming soon' hihihi..Bourne Supremacy and Collateral are on the top of my list. The village? I don't know,&nbsp;I get scared easily&nbsp;by watching that kind of movie.&nbsp;I also haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, The Terminal, and The Notebook. Isn't that sad..hiks.   By the way, I got a call from Neeru this afternoon. He's been having fun for the past two months in Jakarta now!! I'm so jealous. But I will see my parents too in about two weeks though. Yup..they're coming here. Well, I'm planning to meet them in Las Vegas. I made a lot of plans, and I just found out yesterday that I have to be in a two weeks full of training when they're here. It's kinda sad, but I'll see what I can do with the schedule.  Well, that's all for now. Have a great night you guys!             "
"             Quotes from You've Got Mail:   urlLink  Frank   : What about you, is there someone else?    urlLink  Kathleen Kelly   : No. No, but, but there's the dream of someone else.      You've Got Mail is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've watched it more than 20 times or more. I really like to watch the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. They look so cute together. The reason why I put the quote above is because I feel like I'm in the same situation with Kathleen. My friends have been asking me the same question over and over again, and my answer is still the same. NO. But the quote above is my real answer. I've been having this dream for years, even when I was still with my ex. Isn't that funny? What if..this dream keeps haunting when I end up with someone else? What if..this dream is supposed to come true? Although, I don't even know how to make it happens.  The question that keeps coming up is,  'should I wait..or should I not?'            "
"             I can't believe that Summer is almost over. I have only 18 days left before school starts and I haven't done anything exciting this Summer. That sounds really sad isn't it..hihihi. Anyway, I really need to get out from this town. That's why, I'm planning to go to New York to meet up with my three best friends in a couple of weeks!! Yay..that's exciting. I haven't seen them in a while. Although it's only gonna be a weekend get away, I'm still really excited!!!  Today, I had a picnic with some friends from work. Actually, It was supposed to be a meeting, but we decided to do it differently. We went to City Park at noon and had lunch there. Each of us brought some dishes or drinks. It was like a little pot-luck party. The meeting only took about 10 minutes, then we decided to play Bocce Ball, one of my favorite sports hihihihi. It is really easy and I'm not sure that it can be considered as a sport, because I'm really bad at sports hehehe.  I got home at around 2 and spent my afternoon watching dvd and taking a nap :P I've been watching some movies these couple of days.            I watched : stuck on you, monster, butterfly effect, 50 first date, along came polly, and the human stain . I didn't get to see them when they're playing at the theatre, so I just rented them.  Butterfly effect ? That's the movie with Ashton Kutcher in it. I, honestly, didn't really get the connection between the Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. Well, maybe it's just me. This movie is..'interesting'..it's just like one of those Twilight Zone movies, but I prefer to watch twilight zone instead of this movie. So, don't waste your money to watch it hehehe. The other movies were alright, except for  The Human Stain , I slept during the movie and watched it over when I woke up :P It's a little bit boring.  I've been really enjoying my days lately. Although I have to work almost everyday, I still have some time to relax and have some fun. Sometimes just to sit at home, watch tv, and do nothing can be relaxing. Don't you think?          "

"                 When I went to do a little digging into the root causes of jealousy as a phenomenon that occurs in more humans (and within ourselves) more times than we care to admit, I was surprised to find the word ‘love’ absent from any arguments and theories attempting to explain the emotion. I use the word ‘emotion’ loosely here, because the act or feeling of jealousy is really a complex combination of many elemental emotions- primarily fear, anger, loss, the need to be validated, the need for attention, and so on.   There are so many theories as to the roots of the matter, and all valid in their own rights, that it’s hard to focus on just one or two. However, in this post, I have decided to stay within my own experiences, and elaborate on two theories- historical and developmental.   The first talks about how insecurity within a relationship is, to a certain extent, built into our psyche from the get-go. From a female point of view, since males can procreate with any number of partners, and at a much higher rate simply by inseminating multiple females, while women can procreate only a certain amount of times, and with only one partner at a time, they have much more invested in their offspring. Hence, they are keener on keeping track on whither and when their chosen partners stray, and have an active interest in keeping that straying to a minimum.   In the case of the male of the species, since they can not procreate on their own, rely on the females to do so on their behalf, the threat of the genetic bond between a father and his offspring is by definition, doubtful because of the female’s ability to have extra-dyadic relationships. Neither gender is so strongly bonded to the other without the volatile concept of ‘love’, that there is no possibility of doubt in the relationship.  Another train of thought explores how infants, particularly those with a high level of imagination and hyperactivity are prone to disregarding the possibility that their caretakers have a life outside of the relationship shared between them. The children that, as they mature, realize that their guardians have relationships, interests and activities in their lives that are completely removed from their wards, usually tend to be less insecure through adolescence and adulthood. However, those that can’t accept that fact, tend to surround themselves in these fantasies wherein the child is singularly important to the caretaker, and most often, in cases where the caretaker tolerates these fantasies, as the child matures, these fantasies not only grow in intensity, but they are also transferred to others in his/her range of vision. Here, the child goes to the extreme of attempting to destroy the connections and thoughts of the caretaker that do not pertain to the child and its interests.   The extreme of this phenomenon leads to the child (and the adult) becoming unable to make the distinction between attacking the ideas of those it cares about having outside relationships and interests, and attacking the subject of its jealousy.   Another reaction that the subject has when affected in this manner is the development of a strong vigilance in monitoring their partner’s behaviour, their actions and interactions. Stemming from their own feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection and abandonment, they tend to take a more than healthy interest in the comings and goings of their partners, believing that the partner should be responsible to them in all respects of their existence. No action should be taken that is perceived as unnecessary or ‘wrong’ in their eyes of the subject. This is especially important when it comes to outside relationships between the partner and those of the opposite sex. The subject translates all their feelings into the conviction that the partner (or the friends) are sexually attracted (to their partner), and are actively making advances on them in their (the subject’s) absence.   In my own experience, the second theory holds true. In a fit of bad judgment, I spent a fairly large portion of time pandering to what I knew were unhealthy and unreasonable requests by this person I was involved with, and ended up losing a lot more than I had gained from the relationship. Receiving neither comfort nor support through that period of my life, I found myself constantly having to explain my actions to this man, having to give up on external relationships that meant a lot to me, and at the same time, watching as every request granted turn into another, more unreasonable one. The tendency toward violence was present also, and though never brought to fruition, was a definite threat, and ultimately what ended the relationship.   Upon discussion with a psychologist (namely, my mother) I found that this problem of insecurity was caused in a large part by his feelings of inadequacy, that he felt that he was unable to be loved, appreciated or admired. He would go out of his way to point out his fallacies, and then demand to know whether I still loved him. Eventually, I realized I didn’t. Entirely too much of his own life and how he looked at himself was dependent on how much I was willing to give up for him, it almost got to a point where if I wasn’t willing to give in, then the relationship wasn’t working, or there was something wrong with me, which lead to the conclusion that I must be cheating on him somehow.   What is possibly the most discouraging fact is that these issues are most often so deeply indoctrinated within a person’s psyche, that it is virtually impossible to conquer them. Most people live their entire lives in this manner, and their partners (especially those that don’t have this problem) have a hell of a time dealing with it. The same fights will happen, and more so in a long term relationship, the more secure of the duo will end up sacrificing relationships and external interests in order to keep the peace.  The more insecure of the pair, possibly due to these problems, tends to be the more aggressive of the two, and the cycle continues- where at first it was the caretaker pandering to the child’s fantasies, now it is the partner. The problem is that, especially in Indian households, where the woman is still to be the submissive of the two, an insecure male dominates her life, and since she is expected to acquiesce, her life becomes meaningless outside of serving him and his needs. There is no way to break this cycle however, without extensive counseling, and frankly, I’m yet to encounter someone taking themselves to a shrink to get over being jealous, at least of their own accord.   As for me, I’m just beyond relieved that I’m not in one of those situations any more, and as wonderful and philanthropic the idea of 'saving' or 'helping' someone is, I ain't got the patience.

"                 There is a school of thought that claims that human beings are separated from animals by our ability to control instinct, for without self-control we're just smarter monkeys. This of course, is bullshit. Instinct cannot be controlled by definition. That is not to say that trained thought and concentration cannot take remedial action, but rather that we will do what instinct forces us to before our brain can control it. How many times has somebody thrust their hand up close to your face to make you blink? Even if you know that its coming you can't stop your reaction. It can be pretty annoying.   A lot of emotion has to do with instinct. Noone teaches you how to feel sad or happy, its built in. In our capitalistic modern world we place heavy stress on individuality, creativity and emotion. We even aggrandize emotion and say that it is the root of our humanity. The difference between us and animals.   The contradiction is obvious, if you're willing to believe that all emotion is based on instinct, but perhaps there is room for a hybrid of these two viewpoints.   Of all the emotions we have, and it is a fairly extensive repertoire, I'd have to say jealousy is one of the least controllable of all. It is intertwined with desire, another fairly strong emotion which makes it even more potent. Intelligent people turn into blithering idiots, people that have it all 'together' become barely recognizable contortions of themselves. I think its fair to say  everyone  feels jealousy at some point or the other, the thing that differs is how they handle it. How much control their will can exert over it.   In my personal experience I can control it almost everytime. I feel it but don't mention it and don't take action upon it. Alas not everyone has my iron mental grip on their emotions. I've been on the receiving end of jealousy more times than I can count and it has not been pretty. That's not to say I didn't like it.  While it is a destructive force in a relationship there is a kind of solace in it. At least the other person cares enough to get jealous in the first place, right? I know a lot of women that use jealousy as a kind of 'love yardstick'. The more jealous a man gets, the more he loves you. Of course, they bitch and moan about it but the bottom-line is that you need jealousy. Jealousy is like this ultimate form of flattery: it means this person desires you in the basest, the rawest of all human emotion. I would be lying if I said I didn't like to see a little jealousy in my significant other.   My lack of jealous displays has raised a few eyebrows in the past. Like some freak people point and stare at. 'Your girlfriend has been talking to that guy all night! Aren't you going to say something?'. It finally boiled over one day and I had to explain the fact that I did feel it, I was just good at not showing it. So now there's this new rule. I don't mention it right away but rather on the way back home. Something like: 'You know when that guy gave you a big hug hello? Yeah I felt a little jealousy back there'. And we're all good.   In my opinion, it is the instinctive nature of the emotion that causes this behaviour. We  need  to see jealousy to prop up our egos and give us that lovin' feeling. Its stupid, its irrational, its illogical and we love it. As long as you get some balance of control and instinct going you can use jealousy as a method of both measuring and maintaining a healthy relationship.             "

"       I like the fact that they killed the President.   Why is it that the Vice President is always the asshole though? Is it impossible for a movie to depict the President as being an asshole? I mean we know they are assholes, the present one being the case in point. At least the President in the movie seemed to be an idiot. Very realistic on that score.   Dennis Quaid is an idiot too. Believable as a rugged arctic adventurer, harder to believe as a real human being.  I just hate the way he acts. I think he is a boring person in real life.   Other than that, I thought the movie was great. It's always nice to see stuff blow up. The scene in LA with multiple twisters was awesome. That and the waves of the sea frozen so it looks almost like a desert. Isn't there some saying about the desert being the sea of the land... Or something equally paradoxical?

"       I just got done reading this article:  urlLink Eurogamer.net - Microsoft set to offer XNA technology to consumer electronics rivals . This is the right way to go about it. If you're making games today the hardest choice is having to pick a platform or pay out the waazoo for a piece of the other hardware manufacturer's pie. XNA might just be a the best way to go about it. I'd love to have a competing open source standard (As OpenGL is to DirectX) but I think it takes somebody with the muscle to put out it's own console that will be able to drive adoption. If the Phantom guys at  urlLink Infinim  want to survive they'd be jumping on this bandwagon as soon as they find the trail.   I was concerned with the reference to movies and about how it is the 'perfect analogy'. Firstly both movies and music are far less complicated technologically when compared to games. There is a 'right way' to see a movie. It scales down to a smaller screen, the sound drops from Dolby Digital whatever to mono as required but as long as you're capable of churning out upwards of 30 fps you can play a movie. There is also a 'right way' to play a game. It needs to be played on the platform it was designed for. You can't expect a game written for a PC to work on a handheld. That means theres a hell of a lot more work involved in making games as flexible as movies. That little handheld can't possibly have enough juice to play your game as well as a PC could. You'd end up making an entirely new game, oftentimes sans 3D for that mobile platform. How is that the same as movies? The PSP will play your movie, the iPod will play your MP3. I think it's an oversimplification to believe that the game will work perfectly on so many platforms just because it uses XNA. Games are not as simple as movies. At best it is an analogy that falls apart at the end. XNA has the right idea, but it's going to take something special from Microsoft.         "

"       I'm new to the blogosphere. I knew it existed, frequented a few blogs here and there and never thought about setting up my own. Which is rather weird, now that I think about it, since I'm all for trying out new stuff. Anyway, the reason I finally got involved was because I read a blog with a beautiful design, actually it was this very template.   As a web developer by profession I was naturally attracted to the simplicity of a page that lost none of it's beauty because it didn't have aqua buttons or flash or javascript trickery. I had no idea what I was getting into when I right clicked to view source. It was nothing short of a revelation.   Nestled comfortably in this elegantly coded html file was nothing whatsoever. That is to say there wasn't the stuff I expected to see. Instead of the nested tables and IE/Netscape hacks with indentation from hell I saw no content formatting code at all. The content was there in simple &lt;div&gt;s and &lt;p&gt;s but that was all.   They had managed the holy grail of web design: Separation of content from formatting. CSS is finally living up to it's promise.  Now I'm not an idiot. I know what CSS can do, hell I use CSS on every site I make. I just didn't know how far people had managed to get it to go. There were always compatibility issues, unsupported properties and a plethora of other problems that had no solution.   Things have moved on since the last time I looked. I've been gobbling up information on the new way of doing things.  urlLink A list apart ,  urlLink CSS Zen Garden  and  urlLink Douglas Bowman's Stopdesign  (he's the guy that made the template I'm using and redesigned Blogger) have all been incredibly useful resources. Needless to say I'm moving  urlLink ActivElement 's site to this kind of separation and all new projects will use this method alone. To hell with Netscape 4.  Job #1 is to redo  urlLink my home page  with pure CSS. It should then be relatively simple to get this blog to match.         "

"       There are those that have so little faith in the American judicial system that they think SCO actually has a case. I beg to differ.

The odds of SCO making good are slim at best.   It is almost comical to see SCO play the bad guy trying to get money from people giving software away. Linux is obviously the good guy, grassroots movement, everything for free, tree-hugging hippie of the software world. As with any good hollywood movie, the bad guy gets what's coming to him and the good guy gets the girl... which in this case is probably more market share.   This entire fiasco can only make Linux stronger. It's like a huge PR exercise to prove to people that the Linux code is not only utterly free (because the copyright holders have chosen to release it under the GPL), but that it is so good that SCO, the makers of UNIX, think it has to be a rip-off of their operating system. I can think of no higher praise.  SCO are done for. To all you SCO stock holders, a word of advice: Eat the loss and sell now. It will only get worse.          "

Finally I searched for how to open an iPod thinking that would at least give me a tip as to how to get between the plastic top case and the bottom metal one. Lo and behold this turned up results.   The recommendation was to use thin plastic used in Radio Shack packaging. With no Radio Shack within a 1000 miles of Pune I started hunting around my room for a suitable piece of plastic. I now have the case popped back into place... and the implement used? A rigid strip of cold medication (Cold-Act to be presise).   So now you know. And knowing is half the battle. G.I.

"            Mornin, y'all.      Interesting bits in the news this morning. First off, over 750 fell sick while visiting South Bass Island in Lake Erie this summer. They're not sure what to blame it on... hm... could it be partly because the Great Lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation? You stick your hand in the cesspool, you ain't getting it back. It's almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray. Or- it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break... You see why I don't like to eat at restaurants so much anymore? A pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach.      In other news, the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection. And it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and AIDs to spark this course of action?       Well, another interesting night in the Olympic arena. A white man can  run , and fast. Hats off to Jeremy Wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99% of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color.       And- would you believe it- a  raucous  night in gymnastics?       It seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving. After a practically perfect vault from Romania's Marian Dragulescu, the judges almost  begrudgingly  gave him a 9.9- I can't remember the last time I've seen a 10 in this sport.   No one in the world can vault like Dragulescu. No one can stick a landing after a front triple like Dragulescu. A 10 wasn't in the cards, but he's supposed to be happy with a 9.9?    At that point, he was sitting pretty ranked #1. After his score flashed, he hid the disappointment, but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park. You tell me that he wasn't affected by his score.    Move to the parallel bars- same story. A flawless performance by Hiroyuki Tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring. On high bar, Alexei Nemov completed an unheard of six- count 'em, folks,  six-  release moves and stuck his landing. What was his score? 9.7 . It was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges. It lasted for ten minutes, postponing Paul Hamm's routine, until Nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop. Hamm's performance was nearly void of any discrepancy, but in my opinion, not good enough to surpass Nemov, which he did. Unsurprisingly. Hamm won the silver, Nemov's score was enough to send him home in 5th place.    It was a Malaysian judge who didn't think Nemov was good enough for a medal. Didn't you all know? Malaysia is the world's leading producer of first-rate gymansts! Sure are- they keep 'em all in a box underground and they're planning a release in time for the 2012 games.     In other news... I haven't suffered a wedgie yet today.    Peace.                                     "

"             Hello again, y'all.  I can't resist making a comment or two about Svetlana Khorkina, the russian prima donna of gymnastics.  It seems that Svetlana is pretty sore about losing the all-around competition to America's Carly Patterson last week, and has taken to vocalizing her opinions to a russian newspaper. See, she feels that the judges had predetermined Patterson as the winner, and in her words, 'fleeced' her for the entire competition.  Let me take a step back. Khorkina is a product of the russian sports machine. They've churned out numerous gymnasts, divers, volleyball players, and wrestlers, among others. In a country that is too poor to support its once to be reckoned with space program, they invest everything they can into their athletes, and it has been paying off- until recently.  Alexei Nemov is the last man to my knowledge to win the men's all-round in gymnastics for Russia. Alexander Popov was 'The Russian Rocket' in Barcelona, Atlanta, and Sydney, but resolved to slink out of the pool after failing to qualify for events in which he'd previously been so feared in Athens. Rulon Garder defeated the russian wrestling favorite (can't think of his name, but this man was a BEAR) to win the gold medal. Now, don't get me wrong- these are all awesome athletes. They once dominated thier respective sports, but knew enough when they were defeated. I can't think of anyone who has acted as unprofessoinal and unclassy as Khorkina.  In Sydney, it was discovered that the vault had been set five centimeters too low and consequently sent Khorkina crashing to her knees. My heart went out to her. She fell off the parallel bars. Again, my heart went out to her. In Athens, she fell off the bars again. Guess what? My heart went out to her. When Patterson defeated her in the all-around competition, I felt a sense of sadness as I knew that it would be Khorkina's last Olympics. She paraded around the appartus, toting her flag, draping it over the parallel bars, acting like she has for the past ten years or so- the russian darling slash prima donna- a very fitting role.  She commented that the silver medal was grand, in so many words, and that it was the best day of her life. Yet, four days later, she's changing her tune and crying foul. Give me a break! Khorkina should wait to talk smack after the Olympics are over and stop falling off apparatus- then maybe she'd win the gold medal.  Anyone watching the competition can clearly see that Patterson was the most mechanically correct out of the entire field. She didn't fall, she didn't stumble. She deserved the gold and got it.  Khorkina has to realize that even though she is a sentimental favorite in the sport, it's not going to earn her medals. Near-perfect routines sometimes aren't even enough. It's a different scenario than Paul Hamm and the korean controversy- there, it was the judges screw-up. Here, it is Khorkina's screw up. Get over it, Svetlana. You're not the top dog anymore. The top dog won the gold, and even if she doesn't travel to Beijing to defend her title, she is still the Olympic champion.  However, feel free to come up with your own opinion.      If you're going to award gold medals to sentimental favorites because you feel they should get it, call Popov back to the pool and give him a couple. Give Jenny Thompson three. Hell, I have a lot of friends- give ME one.  Oh, wait- that's not how you're supposed to do it? Somebody had better tell Khorkina.        Peace.           "
"            Mornin', Y'all.      Six a.m. and I am tired.  Just woke up a half hour ago and I'm ready to crawl back under the covers and snuggle with my pillows.  Anyone else feel the drudgery of life like a vicious, neverending cycle?  Eat, sleep, poop, something like that?        I'm too old at 25 to live on the edge anymore, and on the edge I mean spending all my money at clubs and staying out til dawn, only to stumble into work still smelling like smoke and alcohol.  I did that for a while.  Some of my friends still do that.  Number one, I don't know where they get the money because we all make the same amount, and number two,  it should be old to them by now.    It's like those 35 year olds who still try to pick up girls at the club, all spiffy in thier silk shirts and tapered pants.  Just  old .      I start a new job with FedEx soon, and I'll be working creature of the night hours- seriously.  11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday through Thursday.  Hey, I'm not complaining.  It means that I'll miss all the lovely traffic down the 101 every evil morning and all the little shits coming back from nights of crazy partying.  I am no so much concerned with hours as I am with making enough money to feed my belly and Jess'.  And maybe get that guitar I've been eyeing on Musicians Friend for a while- a Squier Strat, all black and shiny.  But that's not important.      Wonder what shift I'll work when I become a doctor.  I watched a show where this ER surgeon had worked mids for three years.  Now that's just too much.  I'm hoping that if I specialize, I can  sort of  make my own hours.   Someone tell me I'm dreaming- I don't know how this stuff works!      Anyway, anyway, anyway... Off to the place where I stare at a computer all day.  Hope this finds y'all well and behaving yourself.      Peace.                 "
"            urlLink    Me. A doggy bed. Need I say more?  urlLink             "
"            Ah yes, the summer Olympics are now halfway over. I've settled into the familiar routine of watching absolutely nothing but sports for days on end until three in the morning. In about a week, I'll be at a loss as of what to watch for a while and then I'll settle into another routine- the same one that I had  before  the Olympics.      There's always stories that come out of the Olympics that inspire, anger, satiate even. Already I can think of three.      I enjoy Michael Phelps. Not only does he have bragging rights, he  refuses  to use them. He loves to be part of a team. He credits everyone around him for helping him succeed in a sport where it's all touch and go, literally. He's one of the most composed and humble athletes I have ever watched, and it's absolutely refreshing. He swims all year-round to give credit to everyone, himself last.       Paul Hamm is said to have won the gold medal in the men's gymnastics all-around on a judging error, and that the medal should have gone to a korean gymnast. First of all, shut up. Paul fell onto his ass during a vault, sunk all the way down to 12th place, and was able to pull it together enough to medal. The fact that he did  that  should be enough. It's always the fat assholes who like to judge our elite athletes behind a microphone as if it's easy to compete at world class competition level against the best of the best. Who the hell is Al Troutwig? Has he ever competed a day in his life in gymnastics?      And Jenny Thompson. I've followed her swimming career for as long as I can remember. Everyone makes such a huge song and dance about how she's the world's best teammate, helping her team members to the top of the podium, but has never won and individual gold medal. Do they  notice  how fast swimmers are at this level? How close the races are? They speak of a second as if it's an hour. Give me a break. Jenny has balls the size of Manhattan to swim competitively while she's immersed in medical school. She's also suffered heartbreak this year after losing her mother. Again, fat bastards behind a microphone make it so easy to judge and point out flaws rather than significance of strength and courage.      I'd like to start a pestering squad to urge Jenny to come back just one more time for Beijing. Then, her critics will have to shut up. How many of them can swim 50 meters in under 25 seconds? Assholes.      I love them all, all shapes and colors and religions. They are beautiful, talented, hard working, and they deserve every accolade we can give them. They also help to encourage me to work out pretty hard for two weeks out of every four years.      One more question- who is this chick who calls commentary during diving? I have literally seen ten competitors dive into the water, produce absolutely  no  splash, and this Elfie girl will say something like 'Oh, no, she was short of vertical...' , 'Nope, there were three drops of splash that landed on the forehead of the chinese judge...' Anyone give me some insight?      You gotta love sport.      Peace.                "

I am on my way, shortly, to pay the first installment of this years tuition for my children. It's crazy. I will be paying damn near as much for tutition a month as I do for rent. And I don't really care for this school. So, that, in itself, makes the experience extremely painful. But, for right now it's convenient. Just a couple of blocks north.  I shall have to endure the pain for at least one more year, then we can check into St. Daniel's.  Which is the grammar school Nick attended.   And I really like that, but they did not have a full-time preschool.  St. Rene does.  Answers the question of what I am suppose to do with the kids while in school and at clinicals.   Luckily, I have the world's greatest mother in law, if it wasn't for I wouldn't have made it this far.  She watches my kids, makes sure they get to school and never complains about it.  I think she really, really wants me to suceed and I appreciate all that she has done to allow me the opportunity.  Okie, off to the school.  WISH ME LUCK.  They always seem to have something that you need to buy and forgot to mention at the end of the school year.  YEAH!, like I need another friggin' bill this month.  August is our UGLY month.  But, we will survive, with minimal scaring to show for it all...:P  May the blue bird of happiness visit you today!  Dina       "

So, I guess I will have to weed through my shoe closet and see what I can wear and then pick my outfit from there. *go me*  I am thinking about posting the pic of my toe. It looks really, really....uhm, RAW!  *snicker* I will decided tomorrow if I will be doing that or not.  Peace my brothers and chickadees!         "
"                 The hubby and I went to his sister's graduation party.  I had a nice time.  But, it appears my boobs have become quite a topic of discussion..*boggle*  It's like they have taken on their own identity!  I truly believe the girls in the Fam are jealous.  So, me and 'the girls' would like to say this to them...'nah-nah-nah'  Yes, I do indeed have a sensitive bone in my body....:P  Really, I do care about their handicaps...NOT!!!       "
"                 Frankie, showed me the way to this new little toy.  *hugs Frank*  I hope to be entertaining, that's about all I can promise.   Right now,  I am sitting and debating the very complex world of wardrobe.  It's either striped capris or the army green ones.  Decisions, decisions!!!  Why must life be so hard?!?!  Oh and..I WANT SLIDERS!!!  *enough said on that subject*         "

"       It’s crazy how you never know!  You never know whose watching who’s listening and who knows more than you think.  There is no trust amongst family and friends any more.  If there ever was?  I wonder sometimes if that trust that I felt and that bond that I imagined was there ever was.  Was I the blind one?  I believe I was.  I now see a world of liars, cheats, thieves and back stabbers.  No down to earth trust.  Is there even a need to be trusted?  I know that I once had that need.  I would go to the bitter end to prove my loyalty; and what happened I got fucked.  Bent over and shafted.  I chalked it up to bad decisions and tried again.  Once again I'm bending over the railing.  Chalked up, another bad decision.  Down the road I am more cautious now, I watch closely the ones that I least expected…but I was still blind.  I was blinded by my own weakness to want to trust and be trusted.  It may be a natural human need, but it’s a weakness. You see my take on it is everyone is out for themselves.  They will lie and play up to everyone and anyone including the ones they love.  For some reason they have been trained to think like this and it’s unfortunate.  They lack the ability to see the power that comes with numbers, trust and loyalty.  It’s b/c of this trained way of seeing and thinking they will struggle maybe not in the physical means of life but in the mental means.   But what about me?  What about the person who wants to trust and wants to be trusted and loved?  You want to know?  I become cold.  I become trained to no longer let you in.  I develop methods to trick you into feeling like I’m close and you can trust me cause I am only out for myself.  I learn to drown out that desire to trust and be trusted.  I drown out the desire to love and be loved.  I become all those people I despised for hurting me.    I see now, that’s how it happens.    Well fuck that!  I’m better than that.  I am not you!  I am not the lying, cheating, stealing prick you are!  I will be successful and I will not forget those that helped me get there.  I will earn my trust as they will mine.  I will have a team and together we will accomplish great things.  I want to and will see those close to me (though there are few) happy.  I will be able to trust again.  I will be trusted.  Although I will not be fucked b/c you never know who’s watching, who’s listening and who knows more than you!  I will have a family and I will hold them dear to me and teach them all that I can about life.  I will be there for them no matter what the circumstances!  I will never turn my back on them and I will show them a love that no material possession can ever take the place of.  They will be able to trust me……this will be my success!          "

"       今天突然想起以前在大学时学体育舞蹈的舞伴，还记得她的名字，常迪，google上一查，就查到了她的个人主页，原来她已经到了Pittsburgh大学，容貌依旧，似乎还没有经历多少沧桑。  清华没有多少美女，她应该算上中水平了，而且是计算机系，岂不可算才色兼有？我当时就读汽车工程，准备考G，傻乎乎的愣头青，还胆小怕事，性格内向，不善言谈，敏感，自尊心极强。可想而知，当时我在她面前是多么的自卑。  自卑虽然是自卑，我依然是有骨气的人，起码在美女面前表现得像谦谦君子。我估计她肯定会觉得我太傻太愣了。好不隐瞒的说，我对她还是有一点点奢望的，当然对于当时的我来说，不啻于癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉而已：）我的敏感和自尊心使我那段时间的确很不爽。她跟我谈过一次celin dion，我对此一无所知，像个乡巴佬吧；跟她边说话边跳舞，被直接要求不要聊天了：）；周末的那次加练，我都很希望看到她；最后我申请到新加坡，在工字厅还看到她的名字在申请出国的列表中。。。  当初的自尊心依然那么强，也偶尔会自卑，但终究是心理和心态渐渐成熟，但是situation好像还是没有变，我辛苦的转计算机专业，来到了新加坡国立大学。（这个学校在我最需要援助的时候，给了我唯一的一个offer，每次想到这里，我都情不自禁的由心内而发出的感激之情。）  我要做的也许就是要改变这个situation！！！  看着她现在风采依旧，想起了我的大学生活，没有快乐，没有甜蜜，更多的是傻读书，读傻书，读到头来还是懵懵懂懂。没有独立的思想，没有创新的思维，没有过人的意识。。。      "

"       在悉尼的最后一天，就是要去见识一下大名鼎鼎的袋鼠和考拉了，所以就去Taronga动物园拜访它们两位仁兄了。   门票还真贵，33.5元，没有办法，就此一家，别无选择，这就是垄断的威力。坐着渡船，10多分钟后到了动物园。说到动物园，从我懂事起还真没去过了，所以这次觉得真是新鲜，何况还有考拉，袋鼠呢？   首先就是考拉的地盘，长队排着等着跟它照相，既然慕名而来，就只好排队等着了。看着考拉笨笨傻傻的，又胖又不灵活，我想要不是澳洲把你们当宝，你们还真是早就被灭绝了。在外面等着进去跟它亲密接触的时候，看着它扒在树上，想照几张像，可惜相机变焦能力只有3倍，没有办法。。。这才感觉到变焦能力的重要性～等到我进去的时候，赶紧拍几张。。。   比起考拉，别人袋鼠态度就好多了，到处都是，到处跳动。有只袋鼠跑到游人的路上，结果一群人围了上去，可怜的袋鼠被上下其手。。。呵呵。。。我也乘机跑到一只袋鼠身后，靠得很近的地方合影一张，作为留念～   其他的就没有什么了，要不就是太活泼的没法合影，要不就是太凶猛的，不敢合影。长颈鹿和大象倒是照得很清楚，不过太普通了，没劲。小猫熊到处跑动，照相也照不到，还有一些小动物，影子都看不到（下了小雨，躲雨去了），老虎狮子豹子都没什么精神，哎。。。     "
"       在悉尼旅游，最最重要的自然是要去悉尼歌剧院游览一番，我比较幸运的有个在悉尼的朋友带着我，并给我讲述了许多相关的故事。  作为悉尼城市的标志，甚至是澳大利亚的标志，这个名闻世界的歌剧院设计和建成颇为周折，建筑师的杰出设计，众多人们的努力，终于使歌剧院成为悉尼以及澳洲的骄傲。（不过我的朋友跟我讲，歌剧院的设计上对于声学的考虑不够周到，导致剧院里面有声音盲区。）  悉尼歌剧院傍边就是悉尼的海港大桥，还有The Rocks，包括一些bar和很有特色的店铺，不过，感觉游人少得多。。。   说到人多，当然应该算Star City里面的Casino，就是悉尼的赌城了。赌马，赛狗，轮盘，纸牌，当然也有类似老虎机的东西。在这种类似老虎机的机器上我的运气差，白送的10元我只捞回来4元。。。对于轮盘，如果作微观经济分析一下的话，当然是庄家的赢面大了，0-36的37个选项，每个只赔36倍，所以绝对不是fair play。还有很多人记录轮盘结果的序列，其实按照概率独立的原理来看，下一次轮盘的结果永远是均匀分布的。。。       "
"       悉尼的要付钱的东西自然很贵，但是免费的museum和gallery却真是不少。行程匆匆， 只访问了其中的两个：一个是新南威尔士艺术馆，一个是澳大利亚博物馆。 其他的还有悉尼博物馆，海事博物馆，发电站博物馆，土著艺术中心等等等等。。。  新南威尔士艺术馆收藏极为丰富，该馆共分4层，包括各种绘画，雕塑，摄影作品，土著艺术品，各种设计，其中也包括中国和日本及其他国家的艺术品。油画在其中占了很大的一部分，包括从15世纪到当代的作家的作品。由于年代久远，一些油画都有很明显的斑驳裂痕。中国的瓷器，水墨山水画，书法作品，甚至包括锈迹斑斑的商朝时的酒器，还有编钟等等都陈列在该馆中。中国的诗书画三绝，被翻译成 three perfection，倒的确是贴切:)日本的则有一些屏风等艺术品。  澳大利亚博物馆则是一个很大的自然博物馆，也是收藏非常丰富，包括各种动物化石，鸟类昆虫等等的标本，岩石，金属样本。第一层主要陈列的是袋鼠，恐龙，马等动物的化石。第二层的岩石金属宝石样本则让人目不暇接，各种岩石金属宝石异彩纷呈，绚丽多彩，当然最诱人的还是那些钻石和巨大的金块！71公斤的金块！！！看着金块，眼红到要喷血了，呵呵。     "
"       关于悉尼的生活水平之高，略有耳闻，这次终于亲身体验了一次。 从机场到预定的酒店，全程大约30分钟左右的车程，一路上计价表狂跳，到达的时候已经是60澳元了(1澳元=6.0人民币)，相比之下新加坡的车费真是便宜太多了，当初从机场到学校，还是临晨需要加价的情况下，也才20多新元(1新元=5.0人民币)。公交巴士也是新加坡的几倍，一两站就要1.6元，3，5站就2.7元；也许是因为司机的劳动量大点，需要收钱找钱。地铁更是不得了，从市中心到机场的地铁票居然要12元，快赶上直接打的了。澳洲的公交系统，真是摆明了宰人的嘛。  吃的在澳洲就更加贵得离谱了，唐人街的一碗面就是标价8元左右，如果在新加坡的话，最多4元就了不得了呀，在学校吃的话就更便宜了。怪不得我的一个自费的朋友，在墨尔本读书的，每天回家自己做饭，真是值得同情呀。  在澳洲的时间短，住的价位还是不太清楚，租房的话，一般都是120元左右一周(一个房间)。比较起来，比新加坡稍贵一点。其他的关于房价什么的，就不太清楚了，因为澳洲福利还比较好，应该会比新加坡好点。  总的来说，澳洲(或者说悉尼)生活消费实在是太高，但是收入却不是特别多，但是所幸福利还好，再加上美丽的城市风景，惬意生活也是比较畅快的。     "
"       乘着到悉尼参加会议的机会，我终于有了一次亲身了解悉尼的机会。 &nbsp; 还在飞机上的时候，满目的金发碧眼，随处的明显不同于singlish的英语， 就让我已经惴惴不安了，我的失败的英语口语和听力，这次终于现眼了:( 果不其然，之后的几天让我有了非常深刻的挫折感，所幸的是，我这个人逆商 极为出色，越是让我觉得自己失败的地方，我越是能够在那里爬起来。 &nbsp; 当然此次悉尼之行，给我极多的感慨和深刻的震撼，我在这次旅行中领悟和体会 到了很多的东西。 第一的自然是我再一次验证了自己的英语依然是rubbish，口语和听力依然是我的最大 障碍。。。在新加坡，作为官方语言之一的华语给了我方便快捷之门的同时，也扼杀了 我学习英语的动力和机会。新加坡英语语言环境的缺乏，华语的普及程度，造成了现在 很多中国留学生口语听力低下的现实。不幸的是，我也是其中之一。。。      "

"       作为一个典型的天蝎，我的确是发现自己的报复和报恩心理非常严重。 历史上报复心比较重的人中，杰出的有两个，一个是前秦的丞相王猛王景略，一个是三国时的谋士法正法孝直。  前秦皇帝苻坚和他的丞相王猛，这是一对堪比刘备与诸葛亮的黄金搭档。王猛之才能，文武兼修，足以与诸葛亮媲美。更兼苻坚无以复加的信任和支持，前秦王朝，这个仅仅三代的王朝，多年的建设之下，居然能融合各个民族，国力蒸蒸日上，一举灭亡强大的慕容燕。要是没有王猛的才能，苻坚哪能大放厥词，说我军的马鞭丢到长江里都能阻断水流？  法正法孝直，此人的天蝎特点及其明显，具体见三国演义。但是也就是法正，才使得刘备得益州，3分天下；同时他也善奇谋，一直时刘备的得力谋士。    "

"       The reason is no route information between neighboring nodes is recorded.  Hence, new aodv_rt_entry is added into the nodes between the source node and the destination node.   Another reason is the bid++. The author of MAODV use  bid++; rq->bid = bid;  while in original ns2, it uses rq->bid = bid++;  So there is a problem of duplicate bid. And the timout of bid is set to 6 seconds. That's why so long a delay in my protocol.  Now there is no problem regarding that.   Lesson:  Trace into the packet send and recv function to find out why.  See&nbsp;why packet are dropped, the condition!!!           "

"       In the class Node, it has a member         struct SignalPower neighborSignal[50]; which has only 50 items.   But addNode of Node does care about that, it uses  neighborSignal[index_] and index_++, regardless how big index_ is!!!  This problem may result in modification of T_ of MobileNode class(derived from Node). So T_ is changed, you may see many error like 'Adjust position of node *'.   Especially when you use more than 50 nodes in your simulation code.  Initially, I found T_ was changed, but didn't know why. I thought it is the problem of the node-config. Finally, I use watch to find out T_ is changed in addNode, and then found it is changed by 'neighborSigal[index_]=***'....God, I found out~         "

"             Ok, this whole blogging thing is an interesting oxymoron for me. I'm referring to the idea of publishing your private thoughts to be read by the general public, people i don't even know. And then this thought occurred to me... what about allowing your family to read it? I'm not sure about most people, but for me, I think I don't spend enough time with my family, in fact, i think they don't really know me very well at all.  Is it my fault for not making time for them? yes, I think so in some ways.  But the thought of my family reading my  JOURNAL ...whoa... that's scary. But it shouldn't be that way, right? I mean, my family is supposed to be the people closest to me.  I have another blogger friend, she lets her mom reads her blogs. And it's all about her relationship with her mom. Or rather, lack of it. Makes her mom pretty upset sometimes.      So should there be a self-censorship to who should be allowed to view your blog?        Do the contents of your blog change if you knew certain people read it? People whom you are afraid of being open to?      Well, right now, i'm not sure if i can be so open and honest to EVERYONE. But the strange thing is that, since I'm publishing this, I  AM  being open in some ways. I think i confuse myself sometimes.  And so I can publish my inner thoughts to the world out there, but somehow find it hard to let the closest people to me read the very same words.          "

"             After yesterday night's saga, well, needless to say, I dragged my sorry butt off my office chair and went to join the others for tennis. Hmm.. not bad, my third game, and already i can rally the ball over the net. It felt good to hit something.  But later that night, a friend of mine asked me what was going on in my life.. i seemed grumpy lately. I don't know.. could it be work? A sense of uncertainty about the future, direction in life... etc? Whatever it is, I'm glad she noticed and took the time to chat. I felt much better after that. Did I ever say how grateful I am for friends around me?  Well, I am.  And I thank God for bringing them to me. And for my boyfriend too, who sometimes can be as blur as i am, but who has such a big, caring heart.  Hmm... thinking back abt yesterday makes me wonder abt the balance between being an independent woman and a woman who just wants to be cherished and pampered. (dependant on others in short!!)  Well, part of me didn't want to receive any help from others yesterday... it was more of like my pride talking i think.     'I am woman! Hear me   ROARRRRRR!!!!  '              Meow.         That was how I felt... a facade? A strong woman on the outside, but a soft, vulnerable one inside? I am neither one or the other.. but I'm both.

Ok, I have to be an empowered woman. Stop putting up a pity party for yourself! You can choose to leave the office now. Yeah, I can.. and go home and get my clothes and join them for tennis... but in reality, i just want to go home, sulk, and be pampered.  But no one's coming around to pamper me.  Darn it.  Looks like I have a choice of how I want to react to this situation. Why do i even allow myself to be overtaken by emotions? It's normal, isn't it?  Alright. I will leave. Soon. After I finish this part of my work... ok ok.. that will take another hour at least. No... I think I'll leave.              "

"             Had a really interesting day yesterday.. talked to different people, shared with them about life, God.. etc.. one of them being my maid, just by giving her a lift to the market, gave me the opportunity to share with her about prayer. She shared with me about Thaipusam, and how she prays, but it doesn't really mean anything to her personally.  Also talked to another friend about loneliness... she's tried a lot of things.. and a lot of people have talked to her and said things like... your family's there... u have friends... believe in God and you won't feel lonely. But the fact of the matter is that she still feels lonely. I don't know if she's deliberately pushing people away from her. Does she even want to be helped? She doesn't want to be around 'church-y' people, and that's fine.. i respect her decision. Have I tried to provide 'book' answers for her that doesn't work when all i need is to just be there for her?  And later that night, I went to my cell group (small bible study groups) and found out that my cg leader and his whole family is moving to Bangkok! And the wife is pregnant! :) Wow... I kinda feel sad and happy for them.. sad that they're leaving, and happy that it's the beginning of a new stage of their life.  it makes me think.. so many lives out there.. so many people going thru different stages of their lives. Life    really is  a big canvas, and whatever decisions you make and how you react to situations paint the picture of how the final image will look like.   How  do  I live my life so that I live it to the fullest? What are my priorities? Do i even care about the people around me who are hurting and are calling out.... or am I oblivious to it all... just wanting to have fun and not wanting to have my time interrupted?             "

"             Was doing my devotional today, and I read something that really struck me.. It was a passage talking about Satan, and how he is a deceiver, a liar...  'When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.' John 8:44  The spiritual realm is real... if we believe that there is a God, then there must be a devil. There's a spiritual war out there that we're fighting in, there's no such thing as being a pacifist in this war - you're either  for  God, or  against  God.  So how does the devil go about the task of attacking God's people? Reading from Selwyn Hughes' book, 'Everyday with Jesus' (a backdated issue)... he says...   'Satan's major weapon is always that of temptation. This is how he achieved success in bringing about the downfall of Adam and Eve - and it is his chief weapon still. Satan used a strategy which proved so successful, and it is still one he uses to this very day.  Satan did not attempt to get Adam and Eve to become atheists because he knew that was an impossibility. So he focused instead on getting them to  doubt God's goodness . The devil began by saying, 'Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden?' (Gen 3:1). That question was formed in such a way that it introduced the first human pair to something they had not come up against before - an attack on the  character of God . Eve then explained the situation, and this gave the devil further opportunity to sow doubt on God's goodness. 'you will not surely die,' he said (Gen 3:4). The implication behind these words was the suggestion that if God really loved them He would not have limited them in that way.'   Wow, that passage really sunk deep into my Spirit. There  have  been times when i doubted the goodness of God, and asked Him (more like yelled, actually...) 'where are you, God! Do you even care?' How can I even trust you when I can't see you, or I can't hear you? But in His 'silence'.. a lot of times, there comes a peace.. (especially after yelling and crying to God).. that I can't quite explain, and it is during those times that my spirit within me says... 'He does care... '  I think learning to trust Him and walk His path even though the road seems dark is one of the hardest things to do as a Christian. But there is that thing within me that hangs on still.. and says... 'He does care.. don't give up...'            "

"             I was reading this book called   'Women - God's Secret Weapon'   by  Ed Silvoso  a while back, and found it to be a really fascinating book! This book has really opened my eyes to see that women are really special creations in God's sight, and that Satan really fears us women! Hah! Eat dust, satan!  Here are some excerpts from the book. (with my little musings, of course!)  Ok, let's go back to Genesis when God created man and woman.   At the end of each creation day, except the second and sixth days, God looked at what He had brought into being and declared, 'It is good' (Gen 1:4, 18, 25). On the second day, He issued no opinion. However, the sixth day undoubtedly gave Him the most joy. After minting Eve, He pronounced it 'a  very  good day' (Gen 1:31).      God did not indiscriminately rubber stamp each day with the words 'It is good.' Silence on the second day and the added adjective on the sixth imply that He did a thorough evaluation before giving an opinion. Undoubtedly, the sixth day is the one that gave God the greatest joy.   We tend to assume that Gen 1:31 ('and God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.') refers to everything that He had made during the six days of creation. Ed Silvoso in his book said that though in a general sense this is true, but a careful examination of Gen 1:31 places that remark at the end of the sixth day and in the context of the creation of Eve. This was the only day that God changed His rating of the day's work after creating something.  Therefore, women are really special in God's eyes!  In Genesis 2:7, God created Adam by shaping him or forming him out of dust, but in Eve's case, God employed a different technique and used more sophisticated raw material! Instead of shaping her out of dust, the Lord 'fashioned' (Gen 2:22) her out of flesh and bone taken from Adam. This made Eve twice refined.    Wow... now that definitely beats all the gender jokes out there! Women  are  more refined than men! ahhah... this really made me feel that... as a woman, God delights in me, and places such a high value on me. Therefore, if God sees me as worthy, who then has the right to say otherwise?  And now, on to Satan...  In Genesis, when God passed judgement on Satan...  God lowered him to the bottom of the animal totem pole. God lowers him further by cutting off his feet. 'On your belly you shall go' (Gen 3:14), He declares, downgrading Satan's mobility to crawling. Finally, God ruins his diet too, proclaiming, 'Dust shall you eat all the days of your life.' (vs. 14)      Next, God threatens the devil with the woman by decreeing that her anger will forever be focused on him (Gen 3:15).  The seed of the woman will defeat Satan, who will have his head bruised while inflicting minor damage to the heel doing the bruising . (vs. 15)      Obviously, God is speaking about the advent of the Messiah, but the fact that female anger aimed at the devil occupies such an integral part of God's threat must mean that women have a significant role.    Wow! We are such a threat to satan... this is our position in Christ.. we have the power to stamp Satan on his head...Satan knows that, and that's why a lot of times, he wants to give women the wrong impression... that he's the one in control, but in reality, he has lost all control right from the start! So we do not need to fear him, because he is in the one who needs to watch out!  Therefore, as God's chosen woman, stand tall, knowing that God has designed you for a purpose, and that Satan has no right over your life whatsoever.              "

"             I came to work this morning and found out one of my pc's hard drives is missing. Well, it can be detected, but it's just not working properly. And my project is in it! It's my video editing system, and everything I have been working on the past 4 days are in it, and there's no backup whatsoever. Not only that, I am also rushing for a deadline this evening, and this has really set me back a few hours!   Arrrgghhh....

"             I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, and we had a really interesting conversation. He was telling me about this prayer that he's been praying lately...  to ask God to give all the young adults everything they ever wanted... monetary success, relationships, the lifestyle that they want... everything... but in ONE aspect... where God is supposed to be; one   BIG FAT ZERO  .   So I asked him, what were other people's responses to his prayer?  He said, someone told him... 'hey, what kind of prayer is that!?'  Hmm.. what kind indeed... it really gave me something to think about, because in reality, i know a lot of young adults (especially in the church... myself included!) are seeking for something more in life.. it's like we're never contented... always looking for something more.. more fun, more money, etc..  And yet, there is an undeniable cry from within our hearts for something more meaningful. Something that looks like a God-shaped hole.  I woke up this morning thinking about this, and telling God, ' I don't ever want to have an empty bank account with you!'  (spiritually, i mean, duh! :)  It has been my heart's cry to ask God to fill it... fill it with His presence. And yet, a lot of times, it just seems to elude me. Is this a route that God wants me to take? To just   trust  . Not to rely on my feelings. I have this disatisfaction within me, and part of me thinks it's somekind of holy disatisfaction... to always want to have more of God. That's good, isn't it?  But I can't say that I've  never  experienced God's presence in my life. Many times, He has reassured me by just a gentle nudge in my spirit, about an issue in my life... or something that I should be doing. Or just spoken to me thru His Word.  Could it be then, that    my listening channel has somehow been corrupted?        By something in my life that is blocking my sensitivity to Him... Or is it just the fact that I've stopped listening?  All I know is that I never want to stop seeking Him. And i don't want a big fat zero where God is.                "

"           We have now returned to the days of subsidized sodas.  Yes folks, you heard me clearly.

He wanted to 'address the concerns' of a 'number of us' - and that we will be returning to the days of subsidized cola.  Sodas are once again $.25, when they used to be $.50.

Post-Ba'athist Iraq offers similar geopolitical advantages and oil reserves, without the drawback of tying Washington's hands.'

Basically, that means that without the US, Russia loses $80 Bn over the next couple years - monies that would have come from US companies buying 'surplus environmental credits' from Russian companies.

"           I interpret  urlLink this  article as indicative of a greater societal trend - heading towards a 'big brother' style of Gov't.  If you look at the psychology of markets, as well as individuals, the trend we've seen as of late with markets wildly gyrating at the smallest sneeze from Greenspan, is rather disturbing.  I mean, if these people don't have their own ideas of where markets are headed, the people we pay MILLIONS for their opinions, how good can that be?    This is one of the reasons I didn't get into investment management right out of college - something I'd primped myself for for a long time.  It really is a load of hogwash.  If you have a math degree, and can model, you're the same off as the next guy (once you get to a certain point).  Investors have been relying less and less on MARKET and COMPANY fundamentals, and more on playing the guessing game of 'whats the Fed gonna do', 'where's the next big hit gonna be'.  Folks, they are guessing games.    It all comes back to todays society, the 'gimme gimme's' and 'I want it now!now!NOW!'.  Everyone wants to get rich quick, take a ride down easy street.  The stock market, and increasingly other financial 'vehicles' are seen ever more as the means to the end.  This ideology was what led to the boom of the late 90's, and I'm concerned that the bubble hasn't really popped.  If that's the case, we should REALLY be concerned, as whats held up the economy over the last year (refinancing equity out of homes) - is eroding, and the erosion will continue and accelerate as rates increase.    So, maybe the Fed IS onto something.  But the flip side to that is, you can't manipulate a market forever, again, as we saw in the late 90's  :|         "

In effect, what the ICC would allow would be any pissant country who has beef with the US, to sue our President and Commanding Generals in an international court, where the US is bound to be unpopular.  What Ms. Cohn neglects to mention is that Billy Bob Clinton was the President who expressed interest in this originally, but even he felt the US should have some exemptions as we are the de facto world policeman.  Kind of like, when a cop has to go 100 mph to catch you speeding on the highway, he doesn't get a speeding ticket type shit.    Its people like this woman, who REALLY piss me off.  She can't even see the implications of what she's writing about - all she cares about is humbling the US at any cost.

' The Europeans, arriving for duty in 130-degree heat, “have no ice chests, water coolers, maps, vehicles, tables, chairs, cots, etc. We gave them everything we could to include two Humvees,” the American officer wrote in a private communication to his family.'  ^ Smart          "

"           More sickening  urlLink media bias  can be found here.  Want to know what I'm talking about?  Do your homework.  The current environmental policy calls for, if any retrofits are to be made, an ENTIRE overhaul of every system at a plant - making it fiscally impossible to do, so nobody does it.  Any small retrofit would trigger the rest of a plan needing an overhaul.  Ok, that was the old system.  The NEW/proposed law would allow plant operators to retrofit anything they wanted, one thing at a time.  Thus, eliminating the cost burden, and making it MUCH more likely that they'll do ANYTHING.    In my world, this equates to the 'old' system of rent control in santa monica.  Under the old system, rent increases for new and existing tenants were limited to some inflationary factor.  This led to people living on the beach and paying $400/month - where as landlords expenses were exceeding that inflationary factor, thereby eating into the spare cash flow the property generated.  Thus DIS-incentivizing landlords from investing any capital items (carpets, paint, renovations) into the property: 1) b/c someone will always rent it and 2) they can't support it financially.  Why spend $$ on carpets, if SOMEONE will live there, and you can't recoup the cost anyway.    Long story longer, the State amended that law, and said, on turnover (when a new tenant moves in) you can charge whatever is considered 'market' at that time.  So, we were seeing rents jump from $400 on that waterfront property, to (after redecoration) $2,000+.  Shit, some 3 bed/3 bath units in Samo go for $13,000+!  Under the new legislation of course.    To dismiss the gentrification issue, as long as tenants don't move out, their rents don't change.  So, voila, diversity.    SSDD for this power issue.  By making financially irresponsible policy (environmental act imposed under Clinton) one is able to assuage the masses.  While the law looks great on paper, never is it enacted in the 'real world' b/c it kills shareholder value in one fell swoop.  By allowing utility providers this NEW option, it allows them to remain profitable, and keep their constituency happy by letting them invest in their PP&E.    The Green party is a bunch of friggin idiots.         "

Of course China is the main threat - just funny it's coming in the form of economic pressure (look at our trade gaps, and there's talk of them denominating international trades in terms of the euro, which would SEVERELY hurt the strength of the dollar.  Put it this way, what if all of a sudden you had this commodity that only you made, then, over night, 1/2 your demand just went *poof*.  International companies/countries DEMAND US$ to conduct business - it's stable, it's not going to devalue overnight (like in 1998 with the Russian debt crisis).  Blah.    In addition to the economic pressures, we're also seeing Generals (so consider the source) in the last couple years, publicly state China as the next foreign aggressor, and that they are worried about the future implications of all this shit.    In conclusion, the one thing I have to give Clinton credit for was helping China into the WTO - that is the one way we can subtlely coerce them towards capitalism, and AWAY from M.A.D.

So I was sittin in work yesterday, the day after my actual B-day, feeling kinda dizzy/funny/puke-ish when I decided I probably shouldn't be there and should go home.  First time in three years with my company that I'd come to that conclusion, so you know it's serious.  Or maybe you didn't but I did.    On the way home, I almost pass out four or five times, so damn tired, for no good reason.  Once I DO get home, I DO actually pass out, cold sweat, shivering, only waking up a couple times to run to the bathroom and puke up some phlegm and blood (Mmmmmmmmm: phlegm).   Decided it was in both my, and my toilets, best interest to go to the Doc at  urlLink Patricks  forceful suggestion.    Blood tests are coming back later, but doc says best case, food poisoning, worst case, appendix (hence the blood tests).  The appendix is apparently less than a 2% chance, but hey, don't really need it anyway - hah.  I'm not worried.

"           Well, I'm heading to Yosemite this weekend, solo camping trip. Check out some of the  urlLink wildlife safety  items they have listed.  :/  lol  My favorite:  What should you do if you meet a mountain lion?   Never approach a mountain lion especially one that is feeding or with kittens. Most mountain lions will try to avoid confrontation. Always give them a way to escape.   Don't run. Stay calm. Hold your ground or back away slowly. Face the lion and stand upright. Do all you can to appear larger. Grab a stick. Raise your arms. If you have small children with you, pick them up.  If the lion behaves aggressively, wave your arms, shout and throw objects at it. The goal is to convince it that you are not prey and may be dangerous yourself.  If attacked, fight back!   Generally, mountain lions are calm, quiet, and elusive. The chance of being attacked by a mountain lion is quite low compared to many other natural hazards. There is, for example, a far greater risk of being struck by lightning than being attacked by a mountain lion. +++++ Of course, I'd prefer to just shoot the fucker.  However, I think I'll wind up in jail if I do.  Well, I'm off to buy a 12' fixed blade.  :b         "

"           First off, and off-topic, I wonder why it is I do most of my clear thinking while driving into work.  *shrugs*  In any case, we've talked before about how the 'angry left' is a relatively new phenomenon.  In recent memory (at least to my knowledge, which is admittedly limited) there has never been such a partisan (and polarizing) difference in the 'opposing political elements' as it were.  I mean, we see Democrats going against every measure this administration tries to push through - whether it be Medicare reform, which the Dems are against b/c it steals their thunder with the retirees, to Iraq, which the Dems really don't have any plan for anyways, besides to bash Bush, and hope more soldiers are killed so it 'sends a message' to 'wake up' the US public (assuming that the US public are the ones who need 'waking up' of course).  We see repeated filibusters of judicial nominees on strictly partisan grounds - in some cases even referring to prestigious acclaimed judicial nominees as 'neanderthals'.  Has 1/2 of our major political system been relegated to name-calling?  Seriously Teddy Kennedy, whats with the hate speech?  In other circles, we see protestors lining up with Mao'ists, socialists, communists, greenpeace activists and their ilk in support of murderous tyrannical dictators and despots.  I wonder if any of them actually know that the Communist 'revolution' actually killed many more innocents than did the Nazi's.  And what would be worse, their knowing support of that, or their ignorance (actually it's ignorance either way you cut it).   What we see with ALL of these acts is a willingness to refute REALITY in order to further an impotent political agenda.  Many of us in the blogosphere talk about how AM radio and conservative talk shows are the crux of the new conservative movement in the US.  Al Gore recognizes this, and is in the process of trying to acquire a media license so he can start his own liberal talk show.  Conservatives typically mock this idea for a number of reasons, primarily however due to the fact that a liberal will NEVER win an argument with an informed, intelligent conservative.  Liberal arguments are based on feelings, everything from gun control legislation to pro-choice campaigns.  Their arguments are shown to be false under fastidious fact-checking and OBJECTIVE research.  One of the reasons the blogosphere is so important is b/c it is able to reveal (as an 'independent third party') the mistruths and spin that EITHER party uses to further its agenda.  My contention from the drive in this morning is that the angry left isn't actually a new phenomenon, it is more of a by product of this conservative revolution we're seeing.  Rush Limbaugh is credited with acting as a catalyst of this movement, but consider what there was before him - no opposing view point to tender any assertion made by liberals.  With the advent of blogging, which is clearly dominated by the conservative stand point, and the ever strengthening influence of AM radio, what we are seeing is not a shift, but an  awakening  almost.  Many people who just sat back on the sidelines watching the liberal political circus are now speaking up.  The fact that conservatives have recently taken over control of the Office of the President, Congress, the House and won a vast majority of Gubernatorial races speaks to this 'awakening' of the American.  This has the looney fringes of the left back on their heels.  For so long they were just an accepted part of the 'mainstream left' - but now, the pendulum is swinging and the spectrum has shifted, meanwhile they are out on the fringe finding everything they say/believe in under attack from an emerging column that is gaining momentum.  They've never had fact thrown in their faces to dispute arguments before, and I've got to imagine getting shut down regularly (in a harsh manner) has got to be infuriating.    In summary, the angry left has always been there, now they just have a label, and have been called out for what they are and what we are seeing these days is their natural illogical response to the freight train that is modern conservatism.

I can no longer turn over the power of my feelings to anybody else, which is what I have done a lot of my life.

I won't be hypocritcal. It is politically correct, particularly in any Dem discussion to hope and pray and feel for our troops and scream 'bring them back now'. I'm fighting something bigger. I'm a 58 year old broad and I can tell you that what is going on in our country isn't the usual ebb and flow of politics where one party is in power and then another; where the economy goes through ups and downs.......yawn, yawn--just wait a bit and things will turn out peachy keen. That stupid la-la land is over. I realize that not every GI Joe was 100peeercent behind Prseeedent Booosh going into this war; but I do know that that is what an overwhelming number of them and their famlies screamed in the face of protesters who were trying to protect these kids. Well, there is more than one way to be 'dead' for your country. They are not only not accompishing squat in Iraq, they are doing crap nothing for the safety, defense of the US of A over there directly. But 'indirectly' they are doing a lot. The only way to get rid of this slime bag WASP-Mafia, oil barron ridden cartel of a government, this assault on Americans and anything one could laughingly call 'a democracy', relies heavily on what a shit hole Iraq turns into.  They need to die so that we can be free. Soldiers usually did that directly--i.e., fight those invading and harming a country. This time they need to die in defense of a lie from a lying adminstration to show these ignorant, dumb Americans that Bush is incompetent. They need to die so that Americans get rid of this deadly scum. It is obscene, Barbie Bush, how other sons (of much nobler blood) have to die to save us from your Rosemary's Baby spawn and his ungodly cohorts.   AND, they get really REALLY pissed off when they read sites like:   urlLink Healing Iraq   Written by an Iraqi in support of the US 'occupation'.

Oh, and one last link from the urlLink  LA Times  - from a reformed lefty who had this to say:   Quote: We put them in those rowboats — we antiwar demonstrators, we sophisticated, smart guys. The war was nearly over when I graduated from high school. But high school students were old enough to demonstrate. They were old enough to feel superior to the fools who were running the government. And they were old enough to have known better. They were old enough to have understood what communist regimes had cost the world in suffering, from the prisons of Havana to the death camps of Siberia. Today we are haunted, in thinking about Iraq, by the fact that a noisy, self-important, narcissistic minority talked the United States into betraying its allies. (Loyalty didn't mean a lot to antiwar demonstrators; honor didn't mean a lot.) We betrayed our allies and hurried home, to introspect. They stayed on, to suffer. We were eager to make love, not war, but the South Vietnamese weren't offered that option. Their alternatives were to knuckle under or die. It was my fault, mine personally; I was part of the antiwar crowd and I'm sorry. But my apology is too late for the South Vietnamese dead. All I can do is join the chorus in shouting, 'No more Vietnams!' No more shrugging off tyranny; no more deserting our friends; no more going back on our duties as the strongest nation on Earth.   *************************************** I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons  I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason  I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  One and the same I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself. ***************************************         "

"           This deserves more than just a link, the original can be found on  urlLink Kim DuToits  blog.  We have become a nation of women.  It wasn't always this way, of course. There was a time when men put their signatures to a document, knowing full well that this single act would result in their execution if captured, and in the forfeiture of their property to the State. Their wives and children would be turned out by the soldiers, and their farms and businesses most probably given to someone who didn't sign the document.  There was a time when men went to their certain death, with expressions like 'You all can go to hell. I'm going to Texas.' (Davy Crockett, to the House of Representatives, before going to the Alamo.)  There was a time when men went to war, sometimes against their own families, so that other men could be free. And there was a time when men went to war because we recognized evil when we saw it, and knew that it had to be stamped out.  There was even a time when a President of the United States threatened to punch a man in the face and kick him in the balls, because the man had the temerity to say bad things about the President's daughter's singing.  We're not like that anymore.   Now, little boys in grade school are suspended for playing cowboys and Indians, cops and crooks, and all the other familiar variations of 'good guy vs. bad guy' that helped them learn, at an early age, what it was like to have decent men hunt you down, because you were a lawbreaker.  Now, men are taught that violence is bad -- that when a thief breaks into your house, or threatens you in the street, that the proper way to deal with this is to 'give him what he wants', instead of taking a horsewhip to the rascal or shooting him dead where he stands.  Now, men's fashion includes not a man dressed in a three-piece suit, but a tight sweater worn by a man with breasts.  Now, warning labels are indelibly etched into gun barrels, as though men have somehow forgotten that guns are dangerous things.  Now, men are given Ritalin as little boys, so that their natural aggressiveness, curiosity and restlessness can be controlled, instead of nurtured and directed.  And finally, our President, who happens to have been a qualified fighter pilot, lands on an aircraft carrier wearing a flight suit, and is immediately dismissed with words like 'swaggering', 'macho' and the favorite epithet of Euro girly-men, 'cowboy'. Of course he was bound to get that reaction -- and most especially from the Press in Europe, because the process of male pussification Over There is almost complete.  How did we get to this?  In the first instance, what we have to understand is that America is first and foremost, a culture dominated by one figure: Mother. It wasn't always so: there was a time when it was Father who ruled the home, worked at his job, and voted.  But in the twentieth century, women became more and more involved in the body politic, and in industry, and in the media -- and mostly, this has not been a good thing. When women got the vote, it was inevitable that government was going to become more powerful, more intrusive, and more 'protective' (ie. more coddling), because women are hard-wired to treasure security more than uncertainty and danger. It was therefore inevitable that their feminine influence on politics was going to emphasize (lowercase 's') social security.  I am aware of the fury that this statement is going to arouse, and I don't care a fig.  What I care about is the fact that since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a concerted campaign to denigrate men, to reduce them to figures of fun, and to render them impotent, figuratively speaking.  I'm going to illustrate this by talking about TV, because TV is a reliable barometer of our culture.  In the 1950s, the TV Dad was seen as the lovable goofball -- perhaps the beginning of the trend -- BUT he was still the one who brought home the bacon, and was the main source of discipline (think of the line: 'Wait until your father gets home!').  From that, we went to this: the Cheerios TV ad.  Now, for those who haven't seen this piece of shit, I'm going to go over it, from memory, because it epitomizes everything I hate about the campaign to pussify men. The scene opens at the morning breakfast table, where the two kids are sitting with Dad at the table, while Mom prepares stuff on the kitchen counter. The dialogue goes something like this:  Little girl (note, not little boy): Daddy, why do we eat Cheerios? Dad: Because they contain fiber, and all sorts of stuff that's good for the heart. I eat it now, because of that. LG: Did you always eat stuff that was bad for your heart, Daddy? Dad (humorously): I did, until I met your mother. Mother (not humorously): Daddy did a lot of stupid things before he met your mother.  Now, every time I see that TV ad, I have to be restrained from shooting the TV with a .45 Colt. If you want a microcosm of how men have become less than men, this is the perfect example.  What Dad should have replied to Mommy's little dig: Yes, Sally, that's true: I did do a lot of stupid things before I met your mother. I even slept with your Aunt Ruth a few times, before I met your mother.  That's what I would have said, anyway, if my wife had ever attempted to castrate me in front of the kids like that. But that's not what men do, of course. What this guy is going to do is smile ruefully, finish his cereal, and then go and fuck his secretary, who doesn't try to cut his balls off on a daily basis. Then, when the affair is discovered, people are going to rally around the castrating bitch called his wife, and call him all sorts of names. He'll lose custody of his kids, and they will be brought up by our ultimate modern-day figure of sympathy: The Single Mom.  You know what? Some women deserve to be single moms.  When I first started this website, I think my primary aim was to blow off steam at the stupidity of our society.   Because I have fairly set views on what constitutes right and wrong, I have no difficulty in calling Bill Clinton, for example, a fucking liar and hypocrite.   But most of all, I do this website because I love being a man. Amongst other things, I talk about guns, self-defense, politics, beautiful women, sports, warfare, hunting, and power tools -- all the things that being a man entails. All this stuff gives me pleasure.  And it doesn't take much to see when all the things I love are being threatened: for instance, when Tim Allen's excellent comedy routine on being a man is reduced to a fucking sitcom called Home Improvement. The show should have been called Man Improvement, because that's what every single plotline entailed: turning a man into a 'better' person, instead of just leaving him alone to work on restoring the vintage sports car in his garage. I stopped watching the show after about four episodes.  ('The Man Show' was better, at least for the first season -- men leering at chicks, men fucking around with ridiculous games like 'pin the bra on the boobies', men having beer-drinking competitions, and women on trampolines. Excellent stuff, only not strong enough. I don't watch it anymore, either, because it's plain that the idea has been subverted by girly-men, and turned into a parody of itself.)  Finally, we come to the TV show which to my mind epitomizes everything bad about what we have become: Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. Playing on the homo Bravo Channel, this piece of excrement has taken over the popular culture by storm (and so far, the only counter has been the wonderful South Park episode which took it apart for the bullshit it is).  I'm sorry, but the premise of the show nauseates me. A bunch of homosexuals trying to 'improve' ordinary men into something 'better' (ie. more acceptable to women): changing the guy's clothes, his home decor, his music -- for fuck's sake, what kind of girly-man would allow these simpering butt-bandits to change his life around?  Yes, the men are, by and large, slobs. Big fucking deal. Last time I looked, that's normal. Men are slobs, and that only changes when women try to civilize them by marriage. That's the natural order of things.  You know the definition of homosexual men we used in Chicago? 'Men with small dogs who own very tidy apartments.'  Real men, on the other hand, have big fucking mean-ass dogs: Rhodesian ridgebacks, bull terriers and Rottweilers, or else working dogs like pointers or retrievers which go hunting with them and slobber all over the furniture.   Women own lapdogs.  Which is why women are trying to get dog-fighting and cock-fighting banned -- they'd ban boxing too, if they could -- because it's 'mean and cruel'. No shit, Shirley. Hell, I don't like the idea of fighting dogs, either, but I don't have a problem with men who do. Dogs and cocks fight. So do men. No wonder we have an affinity for it.  My website has become fairly popular with men, and in the beginning, this really surprised me, because I didn't think I was doing anything special.  That's not what I think now. I must have had well over five thousand men write to me to say stuff like 'Yes! I agree! I was so angry when I read about [insert atrocity of choice], but I though I was the only one.'  No, you're not alone, my friend, and nor am I.  Out there, there is a huge number of men who are sick of it. We're sick of being made figures of fun and ridicule; we're sick of having girly-men like journalists, advertising agency execs and movie stars decide on 'what is a man'; we're sick of women treating us like children, and we're really fucking sick of girly-men politicians who pander to women by passing an ever-increasing raft of Nanny laws and regulations (the legal equivalent of public-school Ritalin), which prevent us from hunting, racing our cars and motorcycles, smoking, flirting with women at the office, getting into fistfights over women, shooting criminals and doing all the fine things which being a man entails.  When Annika Sorenstam was allowed to play in that tournament on the men's PGA tour, all the men should have refused to play -- Vijay Singh was the only one with balls to stand up for a principle, and he was absolutely excoriated for being a 'chauvinist'. Bullshit. He wasn't a chauvinist, he was being a man. All the rest of the players -- Woods, Mickleson, the lot -- are girls by comparison. And, needless to say, Vijay isn't an American, nor a European, which is probably why he still has a pair hanging between his legs, and they're not hanging on the wall as his wife's trophy.  Fuck this, I'm sick of it.  I don't see why I should put up with this bullshit any longer -- hell, I don't see why any man should put up with this bullshit any longer.  I don't see why men should have become feminized, accept that we allowed it to happen -- and you know why we let it happen? Because it's goddamned easier to do so. Unfortunately, we've allowed it to go too far, and our maleness has become too pussified for words.  At this point, I could have gone two ways: the first would be to say, '...and I don't know if we'll get it back. The process has become too entrenched, the cultural zeitgeist of men as girls has become part of the social fabric, and there's not much we can do about it.'  But I'm not going to do that. To quote John Belushi (who was, incidentally, a real man and not a fucking woman): 'Did we quit when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?'  Well, I'm not going to quit. Fuck that. One of the characteristics of the non-pussified man (and this should strike fear into the hearts of women and girly-men everywhere) is that he never quits just because the odds seem overwhelming. Omaha Beach, guys.  I want a real man as President -- not Al Gore, who had to hire a consultant to show him how to be an Alpha male, and french-kiss his wife on live TV to 'prove' to the world that he was a man, when we all knew that real men don't have to do that shit.  And I want the Real Man President to surround himself with other Real Men, like Rumsfeld, and Ashcroft, and yes, Rice (who is more of a Real Man than those asswipes Colin Powell and Norman Mineta).  I want our government to be more like Dad -- kind, helpful, but not afraid to punish us when we fuck up, instead of helping us excuse our actions.  I want our government of real men to start rolling back the Nanny State, in all its horrible manifestations of over-protectiveness, intrusiveness and 'Mommy Knows Best What's Good For You' regulations.  I want our culture to become more male -- not the satirical kind of male, like The Man Show, or the cartoonish figures of Stallone, Van Damme or Schwartzenegger. (Note to the Hollywood execs: We absolutely fucking loathe chick movies about feelings and relationships and all that feminine jive. We want more John Waynes, Robert Mitchums, Bruce Willises, and Clint Eastwoods. Never mind that it's simplistic -- we like simple, we are simple, we are men -- our lives are uncomplicated, and we like it that way. We Were Soldiers was a great movie, and you know why? Because you could have cut out all the female parts, and it still would have been a great movie, because it was about Real Men. Try cutting out all the female parts in a Woody Allen movie -- you'd end up with the opening and closing credits.)  I want our literature to become more male, less female. Men shouldn't buy 'self-help' books unless the subject matter is car maintenance, golf swing improvement or how to disassemble a fucking Browning BAR. We don't improve ourselves, we improve our stuff.  And finally, I want men everywhere to going back to being Real Men. To open doors for women, to drive fast cars, to smoke cigars after a meal, to get drunk occasionally and, in the words of Col. Jeff Cooper, one of the last of the Real Men: 'to ride, shoot straight, and speak the truth.'  In every sense of the word. We know what the word 'is' means.  Because that's all that being a Real Man involves. You don't have to become a fucking cartoon male, either: I'm not going back to stoning women for adultery like those Muslim assholes do, nor am I suggesting we support that perversion of being a Real Man, gangsta rap artists (those fucking pussies -- they wouldn't last thirty seconds against a couple of genuine tough guys that I know).  Speaking of rap music, do you want to know why more White boys buy that crap than Black boys do? You know why rape is such a problem on college campuses? Why binge drinking is a problem among college freshmen?  It's a reaction: a reaction against being pussified. And I understand it, completely. Young males are aggressive, they do fight amongst themselves, they are destructive, and all this does happen for a purpose.  Because only the strong men propagate.  And women know it. You want to know why I know this to be true? Because powerful men still attract women. Women, even liberal women, swooned over George Bush in a naval aviator's uniform. Donald Trump still gets access to some of the most beautiful pussy available, despite looking like a medieval gargoyle. Donald Rumsfeld, if he wanted to, could fuck 90% of all women over 50 if he wanted to, and a goodly portion of younger ones too.  And he won't. Because Rummy's been married to the same woman for fifty years, and he wouldn't toss that away for a quickie. He's a Real Man. No wonder the Euros hate and fear him.  We'd better get more like him, we'd better become more like him, because if we don't, men will become a footnote to history.  ********* Sha-zam.         "

"           Went with my buddy (early in the summer) to rent a couple movies down by his place.  He said he had some late fees on his card (warning sign #1) so could we use mine.  OK, but I made him promise me he'd return them.  Done, no big deal.  About a MONTH later, I start getting calls from Blockbuster that I owe them like $80, from their Newport Beach store.   >  Guess who was resposnsible for that?  Kid never returned the movies.    After playing the blame game for a day or two, with him trying to shift responsibility to his brother, I eventually got him to (supposedly) pay the late fees.  It would appear this event is over.  Then the mail came yesterday.  Wouldn't you know 'Credit Protection Association, L.P.' sent me an official looking letter, informing me that my account is past due $36.98.  Effing wonderful.

"           Last Friday I went out for a 'team dinner' at a local italian restaurant (niiiiiiiiice place).  Being the italian food snob that I am, and not seeing my favorite dish (veal saltimbocca) I asked our server to see if the chef had any idea what it was.  As an alternative, I ordered the lasagna.  Well, I got the saltimbocca, and it was a close second for 'best I've ever had' - which is saying a lot.  Well, as I liked it so much, I came back in on Monday AM and was telling someone about ' urlLink one of the best damn veal dishes I've ever had ' - when this groan eminates from behind me.    Now, I know my stomach makes noises b/c of my ulcer, but, this was no stomach.  I turn around to see our  new admin  giving me the vegetarian ' stare of death '.  I immediately start to laugh, knowing full well what this is about, and pose the question, 'What are you, a vegan?' - followed by more laughing on my part.  Go ahead, guess the response, it was something like, 'Actually.  Yes.'  With 200% surety, this was headed downhill.   Fast.  I decided to nip in in the bud and told her that it wasn't even 9:00 yet, and I most certainly was NOT getting in this conversation with her over something as asinine as her dietary preferences.  She went for the rebuttal, 'Do you know how they TREAT those baby cows?', and I walked away.  Laughing some more.

"           But, I just got back from picking up lunch, and that made the second time in about 14 hours that I've come close to fighting someone over something stupid (note: about 7 of those 14 hours were spent sleeping).  Last night leaving 'the last samurai' with KE some asshole in a Rav4 (or equivalent) was hauling ASS through the parking lot, people weren't quite jumping out of the way, but it was clear he wasn't slowing down/stopping for anyone.  Well, he just so happened to have to slow down to round a corner and get by my walking ass.  Well, he cut it really close, so what did I do,  stick out my keys.  Heh.  I intentionally didn't try and get his car, but it was more of a gesture for the 15 other people he was trying to plow through.  Well, Mr. Big Bad Ass driver didn't think it was funny, so he slammed his brakes and got out of the car.  For some unknown reason my first response was to start walking towards him and say 'I didn't get it asshole, get back in your car'.   LOL.  I'd have to confirm with KE but this guy out-weighed me by probably 100 lbs, and about 6'.  Kept walking towards him saying 'look, look' pointing accusingly.  I guess this guy must've felt stupid or something b/c he got back in his car and left,  and I dont think he said one word.    So, that was story one.  Here is story two.  Lunch at the local mexican place.  There are two registers serving customers.  Ok, *every* time I've *ever* been there (approaching 100 times) one cue forms, and you simply take whichever register is first.  Common courtesy in large line venues IMO.  Well, I'm next in line, and some dude comes charging over to register two - right in front of me.  So, I inform him that there's a line, and he needs to  get in it.  He gets all confrontational with me saying, 'Well I'm gonna make you choose, which line you gonna be in', and my response 'I choose this one line that everyone else is in, and you're going to get behind me again'.  Well, we went back and forth like that for about 20-30 seconds, and I stopped him mid-sentence and said 'You know what, I'm gonna let YOU be the asshole today - go ahead dick'.   Heh.  Apparently he didn't like being called a dick, and protested some.  Net net net, he ordered his food, I winked at him when he went to pick it up - the register ladies saw the whole thing go down, and as a net result, I got my food first.  The question is, what IS it with people like that?  The assholes that are in such a fucking rush that they just try and run you over, or cheat to get ahead any way possible?  I don't consider myself a particularly violent person, but when people go out of their way to act like dicks, I call them on it.  Worse more, these people are all show and no go.  The guy from the movie was MUCH bigger than me, and backed down.  I stood up to the chin on the guy at lunch today, and he had me by a good 60 lbs probably - and he didn't do shit, even after I called him names in front of a bunch of people.  Again, maybe it's just me being a dick, but the last 24 hours have been entertaining at the least.         "
"            urlLink Saddam Hussein is caught .  So I come home from another long night of partying (ironically showing a recently-home-from-Iraq Marine a good time in downtown laguna) only to find out that, yes, we have finally caught THE goat-fucker.  Congratulations Iraq, thank you United States.  There are so many great new/blog posts out there, I'm not even gonna bother giving my $.02 on this.  All I hope is that we keep that asshole safe for his trial by the iraqi people.  I'm really looking forward to the reaction of both the angry left and the international community - if what  urlLink Hamas  has said is any indication of anything, I think the next year should be pretty interesting.  In any case, I do want to share the best photoshop I've seen to date on Saddam's capture:    And my caption:  'Hey Chirac,  urlLink ya like apples ?'  Update:  In celebration of catching Saddam, I went out and bought some  urlLink champagne  - 5th from the bottom.  I'll take some digi pics tonight, and hopefully get them up tomorrow.

They reduce the height and spot a person on the ground below.  They lower the balloon further and shout, 'Excuse me. Can you help me? I promised my friend I would meet him half an hour ago, but I don't  know where I am.'  The person below says, 'Yes. You are in a hot air balloon, hovering approximately 30 feet above this field. You are between 40 and 42 degrees North latitude and between 58 and 60 degrees West longitude.'  'You must be an underwriter,' says the balloonist.  'I am,' replies the person below, 'how did you know?'  'Well,' says the balloonist, 'everything you have told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost.'  The person below says, 'You must be a loan officer'. 'I am,' replies the balloonist, 'but how did you know?' 'Well,' says the person below, 'you don't know where you are, or where you are going. You have made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. The fact is, you are in exactly the same position as you were before we met, but now it is somehow my fault.'           "

"           The Achilles has been feelin alright for about the last week (better and better every day).  THEN I went on a site inspection today up in Torrance - no big deal, just had to *walk* about 25 units, shouldn't have been a problem.  Well, I don't know how I did it, but somehow I pissed off my achilles BAD walking to the *first* unit.  The next two hours were spent cruising up and down flights of stairs and running all over this 10 acre property - all in all must've been about 3 miles, on the messed up leg.  Oof.  Went to the PT guy tonight, got my shit checked out - the tendon was all inflamed, so he stretched it out some, some more ultrasound, some more stretching, some ice, and a SICK tape job.  I feel great again!  Woo hoo!  I've got 2 appts scheduled for next week.  In any case, now, getting to what you've all been reading for: the 'front desk chick'.  As I mentioned in my  urlLink previous post , I was gonna make a conscious effort to check the left hand ring-finger to see if it was cool to chat her up.  Well, lets just say I found this ' urlLink true-to-scale ' picture.    Bling.   DISCLAIMER :  From here on in, this post gets serious, and rather grumpy.  Thanks for the reminder (and the KICK ASS! 'title pic'  urlLink Chad !)  So, honestly, why the fuck do girls always want to get married so fuckin early?  I hear the whole ' urlLink biological clock ' argument, but WTF.  Maybe I'm just immature, but shit, I'm 25 and though I've come a *long* way since 18 in terms of relationships, however I  still  can't see my lame ass getting married within the next 10 years.  I got too much shit to do!  Between starting my  urlLink real-estate empire , living in  urlLink NorCal  at some point, living in  urlLink NYC  at some point, living in  urlLink TX  at some point (don't ask), and spending some *serious* time in  urlLink Alaska , who the fuck is gonna wanna follow my fat ass around?  B/c God knows I don't see myself compromising any of my life aspirations for anyone at this point (and maybe that's the problem, eh?).  Though it's nice to be 'unencumbered' at times, at other times it sucks some pretty fat,  urlLink hemherroid-ridden ass .  I mean, I *DO* actually have a good time going camping in  urlLink Yosemite  by myself (for example) - which absolutely horrifies some people.  Alternatively, stick me in the corner with a  urlLink book  and I can bop till I drop.  At other times, all I want is someone to share things with - whether it be feelings, experiences, joy, pain, whatever - it's the act of sharing that's important, it's the catharsis.  I guess I want someone to care and listen, but I don't want to be beholden - is that an  urlLink oxymoron ?   As much as I say I have that with my friends, I do and I don't.  Does anyone else ever wonder what your 'friends' would think of you if they didn't get the 'watered-down' version?  I do, and I withdraw b/c most people can barely handle 'fat kid light' - so I make the compromise to have some semblance of companionship - but how real is it, who am I fooling, and WHY?!?  How shitty, huh.  That was a rhetorical question.  :b  In any case, I don't know why I went off on that tangent.  I must sound like a little bitch, but damn it all if shit doesn't build up in every one of us - I guess it just takes me longer to 'let it out', as it goes.  'The little one' would probably laugh that I have to vent to the internet.  QED I guess, hah.           "

"           So, I have to admit, I went to this thing not expecting much more than a 1) stay off it, 2) ice it and 3) come back in a week so I can charge your insurance another $200.  Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, the guy who 'runs the show' is an avid cyclist (like myself), a surfer, an MTB racer and many other things that I'm also into.  So, he's cool shit.  On top of that, he's also a very nice guy.  That would have been enough to keep me satisfied, but no, he had the obligatory really really really cute girl working at the front desk.  In any case, I'm sittin there chatting about how the injury occurred (my stupid ass pushing myself too hard - as usual), and he was having me walk around, probing the achilles and other shit.  He sets me down to give me some ultrasound with some special anti-inflammatory gel.  He looks at me, see's me checkin front desk girl out, and mentions, 'Hey, why don't you come back here and help out Mr. Murphy with his ultrasound'.  WOOHOO!   The 'cool' factor of this guy just went up 10-fold.  Hah.  She comes over, starts preppin me, and we're just chattin away.  Found out some fun stuff, but stupid me, I forgot to look for a friggin ring.  Gahd-damn.    In any case, real nice girl, real pretty and seemed pretty damn cool.  Gotta make it a point to try and get her # next time I head back there.  I'm usually shy about shit like that, but I gotta get over my stupidity at some point, right?  Net net net, I'm catching the tendonitis at a very early stage, it hasn't yet traveled up the achilles itself, which would be a *very* bad thing (entailing surgery).  Doc's got me on Vioxx, apparently some heavy anti-inflammatory prescription stuff.  Stretch twice a day, ice twice a day, go easy on the tendon, I guess I can get some easy biking in (but no hills).  I should be good to go in a couple weeks if I want to baby it.    I'll keep you schmoes posted.  Oh yeah, and keep your eyes posted tomorrow for a post on african ants.  I saw a show tonight on these things that blew.my.mind.  Heh.         "

This is actually coming back down, and is of a  urlLink nice wooded trail  - #1 or #2 on my list of favorite pics.  This second picture was also taken on the way down (as with all my pics) - close to one of the two falls (I forget which) was this scenic  urlLink rock wall .  Psh, whatever, I like it.  :b  Third pic is a layout of one of the falls - the  urlLink frozen water  on the side of the falls was pretty cool.  I can just imagine the first freeze of the year for this, must be totally beautiful.   The final picture I'm posting here is potentially my favorite.  Interestingly enough this was taken on my drive OUT of the park on Saturday.  I was paying more attention than I normally do and saw this  urlLink serene river  right off the side of the road, so I parked the car, jumped out, jumped a fence, and snapped this one.  Came out pretty good IMO.  All things considered, a kick ass trip.  Froze my ass off, busted up my achilles on my 18 mile (round trip) hike up to, and back from Half Dome.  The drive to and fro wasn't too bad, about 6 going up, 7 coming back.  Net net net, already thinking of planning a summer trip.  Though the cold didn't bother me so much as to not do another winter trip, 1) I'd like to bring someone with me next time, 2) I hear there's a better 'party scene' in the summer and 3) I'd like to be able to go with less clothing (not 15 layers).

So the elbow was put back together again by my kick ass Osteopathic Surgeon (Dr. Covarrubias) using bone putty, two pins and some wires.   About 18 months later, time to get that hardware out of my body.   It was a quick outpatient surgery that lasted about 40 minutes.  In total, I got to the surgery center at 6:15am, into surgery at 7am, woke up from general anesth. at 7:40, in and out of sleep until about 8:45, up and dressed and out the door by 9am. After a big glass of OJ, a bagel and some coffee, off to bed for a 5 hour nap. :) IT was a fantastic, anesthetic and pain medication induced, dead to teh world drooling all over my pillow sleep.

"           Trace route:   urlLink Instapundit  >  urlLink Black Five  >  urlLink Dan Drezner   Looks like the press has 'leaked' a potential 'US Invasion' of Pakistan come spring, in order to catch/kill Bin Laden.  Actually, less an 'invasion', and more of a 'presence', but moving on...  These bloggers talk about a variety of items, the main theme being 'the Sun Times shouldn't have reported this, they're endangering US soldiers lives'.  If it's true (that we're sending troops to Pakistan, then, yeah, I agree).  OTOH maybe this throws me in the 'conspiracy theory' camp, but maybe, just maybe, the gov't WANTS/REQUESTED that the Sun Times file this report - especially given the particularly canned response from the author of the article - as seen in  urlLink Black Five's  write up.  Let's look at the situation: A US presence in Pakistan would be suicide for Musharraf.   Check There have been attempts on Musharraf's life lately (two that I know of).   Check These attacks (if not staged to garner more US support) scare the US.  Check Musharraf has previously said that the US will not ever put troops on Paki soil.   Check Going back on his word would discredit him among his military ranks.  Check The military is the only 'power' Musharraf has.  Check We have a Presidential election coming up.   Check  OK, all those points argue *against* the placing any kind of projectible force on the ground in Pakistan  IMVHO .  However, with that General (too lazy to re-look up his name) making calls like 'We'll have OBL before year end', and the assassination attempts as cover, maybe we already know where bin laden and his top lieutenants are.  We know we can't go in and full-on  get him  b/c of the tribal presences in that region, so who's to say we don't just send some Spec Ops guys in to scare a few AQ feebs who'll report back to 'the boss', get OBL thinkin the cavalry is right over the horizon and flush him out where we hit him with a MOAB or something.    Heh.  Sounds like that would be a classic play, and much more in sync with where military strategy (what I can make of it) is headed -  heavier reliance on psy- and spec-ops .  Guys like Rummy and Wolfowitz would just assume overthrow governments (or whatever) with as few troops/presence as possible (as we saw in Iraq - supply lines stretched thin, heavier reliance on SpecOp forces on the ground, etc.).  The cost (in lives, $$, morale) of moving large groups of troops around is burdensome, as we've also seen in Iraq 'aftermath'.    I simply cannot see our strategists making a dumb move like this.         "

"           So, I was all excited about being able to take pictures off my computer and send them to my phone.  Got two pictures done, then the service mysteriously stopped working.  Shit.  Have sent 2-3 emails to the guy who created the uploader, have yet to get a response.  So, I called sprint, and reported this 'data error 907' - sat on hold for 20 minutes, then got some guy who sort of knew what he was talking about.  I explained to him what I was doing, only to have him tell me that Sprint has 'blocked' that site, b/c of potential copyright infringement.   What the fuck?!?   Apparently if I take a picture of a copyrighted picture with my phone and start passing it around with my phone, Sprint is somehow liable for that.  Sounds like some sort of Kazaa type shit, which is also garbage.   But, thats not what I'm doing.   I'm taking pictures with  MY DAMN CAMERA  and want to upload them to  MY DAMN PHONE  .  What the flying fuck is the problem with this?!?!  As much as I can't argue with the guy (he's an IT peon answering phones) I  DO  think it's complete bullshit that if I take pictures on my own personal camera and want to put them on my cell phone, that sprint is telling me that I can't - b/c that is  EXACTLY  what's going on here.

Then as if to piss all over our better judgement, Davis has received the National Cartoonist Society: Best Humor award. Twice. Garfield gets awarded for humor and 'Family Guy' keeps getting canceled faster than a baby at Planned Parenthood. That reminds me of how much I hate babies. Why does everyone want to save them?

I'm kind of thinking Kerry is the new front runner, regardless that he won the Iowa thing.  With Clark starting to bash Kerry's military record we should see some more mud-slinging from the Kerry camp, but I think Kerry will come out ahead.  His potential waffling points are his support (and subsequent) for UN Resolution 1441, which he has since back tracked on, being so easily 'duped' by our President.  My questions is, if our President can dupe him, how hard is it going to be for the Chinese or the Koreans?  Bzzt - Wrong answer Haughty French Looking Guy from Massachusetts who, by the way, also served in Vietnam.  I guess Clark could come out and lead some polls, but the guy's too much of an idiot to do much permanent damage.  Plus, he got fucking FIRED from the UN's top position after he tried to start WW3 with the Russians.  I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that in the coming weeks.  Honestly, I dont know much about the other candidates, which probably means they won't win.  Hmph.

"           Just back from the 2nd MTB ride this weekend.  Let's just say it's been a weekend of pretty bad luck.  Yesterday, within 1/4 mile of the parking lot (on the way back) my buddy took a digger on about a 25 mph downhill right hander.  Fortunately, he wasn't injured, no blood, no mess - however, 5 minutes later, when we got to the car, what do I see but a fucking $64 parking ticket on my windshield.  Shit.  I had the $5 in my pocket to get the sticker, and simply forgot.  Booo.  Then, today, out for a nice ride - I went up this long mother fucker hill the fastest I ever have.  You know those times when you're working so hard you want to puke?  Yeah, that was me, half way up.  Heh.  Kept going though, suffered it out and kicked some ass.  Good times.    Then, on the way down another trail, I've got these new tubeless tires, so I'm getting used to what the tread can and cannot handle, and apparently the tires couldn't handle this one, loose, off camber turn at the speed I was carrying, so they shot me wide.  Into a cactus.  Hahahahah.  My left ring finger is nice and swollen, and had about 15 inch long needles sticking out of it, my left knee caught some too, with about the same number of needles.  Heh.  Picking those things out is a bitch.  Well, hope everyone's having a great weekend.  For all you east coast bitches, it's about 75 deg out here, and sunny.  Heard wind chill back home was negative 18 the other day - LMAO.         "

Did about a 7-8 mile loop, which consisted of a solid couple mile climb (at least it felt like it - the climb was 90% of the time of the ride - 45 minutes).  Most of you know I live in SoCal (and if you didn't, you've now seen the light) - well folks, there was ICE on the road.

"           For those of you who don't know me, I'm a big effing PS2 RPG dork (playstation 2 role-playing game).  My favorite being  urlLink Final Fantasy X  - which I spent about 244 logged hours playing.  You can beat the game (and I did) in about 100 - and I played an additional 144 hours of 'getting extra shit'.   (Which I never did complete I might add)   For instance, just look at all the shit they have over at  urlLink GameFAQs , for FFX.  Jeesus.  In any case, I went out and bought the one true sequel in the Final Fantasy series -  urlLink FFX-2  and O.M.F.G. am I in a world of trouble.  Every time you get one of these games you have to learn a whole new interface, and all the other bullshit that goes along with a new game.  Typically it takes me anywhere between 10 minutes (for most games) to 4-5 hours with the FF series games to get decent at handling the characters and figuring shit out intuitively.   This game is giving me  urlLink aneurisms  .  Not so much from the complexity to do stuff, b/c I think I've got that figured out, but there are literally ENDLESS possibilities as to how you can build your characters up.  My jaw dropped when I finally started getting a feel for how layered the game is going to be.  Keep in mind I've only got about an hour of 'play time' in it.  From what I can tell so far, the game looks pretty badass.  Great graphics, interesting concept (if you played FFX1) and whatever else you could ask for.  The only downside is the 10 second lag between scene changes.  Anyone know if you can get RAM upgrades for PS2's?  Seriously.  I've come to the conclusion that, yes, I really am a dork.

"           This an excerpt from today's edition of  urlLink Nealz Nuze  regarding Bush's (what I hope will be still-born) plan regarding the potential legalization of illegal immigrants - a proposed amnesty program in essence.  Overall, a bad idea.   And speaking of votes, my friends.  Did you know that there are many areas in this country where non-citizens can vote?  It all started with local school board elections.  Apologists for the non-citizens will argue 'they're sending their children to our public schools, they should have a right to vote in school board elections.'  Next will be 'well, they're working here and paying taxes, so they should have a right to vote in local elections.'  The final move will be 'hey, they're paying income taxes.  They're contributing to our economy.  They should have a right to vote in federal elections.   Slippery slope, yeah.  Slippery slope fallacy, maybe not.  Those of us in CA witnessed Gray Davis' last minute 'olive branch' to minority voters with his  'drivers licenses for illegals' campaign - and it actually (interestingly) backfired on him.  The people who immigrated here LEGALLY don't want their hard-earned tax dollars going to illegal immigrants.  Why should I feel any different?  In any case, something definitely has to be done about the sheer number of illegals here.  Immigration is a great thing, but, like with everything else, in moderation.  The real point boils down to (in my mind) - if you're going to come here, take advantage of our system, at least go through the proper channels.  Sneaking over the border, then claiming that you're entitled to all sorts of bullshit is beyond the pale in my book.           "
"           First off, let me say that  I love direct flights .  OK, done.  LAX to Beantown in just about 5.5 hours - not too shabby - minus my  urlLink DOUCHEBAG  pilot, which is worth mentioning.  So, context first, right?  1) Recent upgrade to ' urlLink Code Orange ' 2) Cancelled flights out of  urlLink Paris  and  urlLink England . 3) Morning news flash that cars were not allowed into LAX due to concerns regarding terrorist threats  OK, mood is set.  99% of the flight was un-eventful, until the final approach to Boston.  Pilot comes on the PA, announcing that we're in a holding pattern due to an un-market flight traveling up and down the eastern seaboard, who has been 'wreaking havoc with air traffic controllers all evening'.  Oh. Fuck.  Of course I start looking for the first middle-eastern asshole on the flight to see who I'm going to have to kill.  In any case, next thing you know, the pilot yells 'HERE HE COMES!' and jerks the plane right, then a quick left.  I shit you not.  Must've been a 75 ft lateral move, then correction.  I looked out the window so fast I almost got fucking WHIPLASH.  Pilot back on the intercom, 'Well folks, that was a close call, looks like that guy only had one running light on - a red one - right in front'.   Fucking Santa Clause.  This asshole thought that was gonna be a funny joke.  *shakes head*  Now, back to the weather fat kid.  Guess I got lucky (a few weeks ago Boston had 18' of snow or some shit) b/c the weather was about 60 for the first few days I was around.  As you can see from the  urlLink pictures in this post , the weather was a little overcast, but pretty damn nice.  I spent most of my time at home just readin and shootin the shit with the 'rents.  Total book tally for week 1 was four I think:  1)  urlLink Welcome to the Monkey House .  Favorite story was, 'Harrison Bergeron'.  You know it's gonna be good when the story's opening paragraph starts:      'The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal.  They weren't only equal before God and the law.  They were equal every which way.  Nobody was smarter than anybody else.  Nobody was better looking than anybody else.  Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else.  All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th and 213 Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilence of agents o fthe United States Handicapper General.'  Hah!  Soooo badass....  2)  urlLink Every Second Counts .   I think Lance Armstrong is the most bad-ass athlete of our AGE, let alone the gay-ass 'Sportsman of the Year' award SI heaps on him whenever A-Rod is having a bad day.  For you doubters out there, try holding his AVERAGE speed for 2,500 miles through the alps pyrenees etc, for one hour.  $5 says you can't.  3)  urlLink The Davinci Code .  Cool book my 'rents recommended.  Some interesting shit questioning the foundation for the Catholic Church, which is always entertaining.  4)  urlLink From a Buick 8 .  A recent work of Stephen King (the master), which, frankly, sucked ass.  I'm a HUGE fan of the Dark Tower series, and considering 90% of EVERYTHING King has ever written is 'part' of that series, I'm a big fan of most everything he writes.  This book was not, though that wasn't the only reason it sucked.  So, in between reading all these books, the only time spent with college friends was @ a house-warming/holiday party for my good friend Doug.  Met up with a few folks I hadn't seen pretty much since Dougs wedding, about 18 months ago.  :/  Good times, and the  urlLink Harpoon Winter Warmer  was flowing (the best damn beer on the market FYI).    The next night I actually got out for an awesome dinner in  urlLink Bostons 'North End'  - the 'ital' part of town.  Had a pretty kick ass salmon dish at that, though the mussels were a little lacking.  Not much between then and new years in NYC.  Highlights of NYC were my buddy Rob hooking up with this (I swear to God)  urlLink Denise Richards  look alike - she wasn't *actually* a look alike, b/c that would be tacky, but this chick was HOT, and resembled her something FIERCE.   Good shit.  OK, yeah, that was a bad link, but how hot is the pic?  Heh.  Here's a  urlLink better face shot .  *sighs*  Not much to report after that besides my contracting a cold, and an uneventful flight back home.  I won't bore ya with details folks, but let's just say, I'm glad to be back in sunny/warm SoCal.  Catch you tramps around.         "

"           The most powerful man in the world  urlLink just took a shit on my chest .  For those of you who aren't in the know, I'm a mortgage banker.  We basically are glorified correspondents for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We perform all the due diligence for loans on apartment complexes, then securitize them into  urlLink commercial mortgage backed securities  (bonds).  The re-payment of principal and interest of which is 'guaranteed' by Fannie or Freddie - meaning, yields on loans are driven down b/c Fannie/Freddie have the implicit guaranty of the government (AAA rated, lower borrowing costs).  Net effect being Joe Schmoe might have an ass credit rating, but he can get a great interest rate if he has a good property in decent shape in a good market etc etc.  All in all, a great deal for the borrower.  A lot has been going on the last few years w/r/t this 'implicit guaranty' by the Federal Government.  Technically, Fannie and Freddie are public companies (traded over the exchanges) so they aren't really governmental organizations.  The argument against them goes, they have an 'unfair advantage' b/c they can lend at lower interest rates forcing competition (GMAC etc) out of the market.  These guys (GMAC et al) have been dogging Federal regulators to disassociate themselves with Fannie/Freddie to make the competitive landscape more even.  The problem is, politically and economically, Fannie and Freddie are the TWO 800-lb gorillas.  In order for ANYTHING to happen to their GSE (Government Sponsored Entity) status, Alan Greenspan would have to say something, as no elected official (even the President) would be willing to put the kaibosh on a MULTI-TRILLION dollar industry.

From Afghanistan, Story of the week:  So we are up in the mountains at about 0100 hrs looking for a bad guy that we thought was in the area. Here are ten of us, pitch black, crystal clear night, about 25 degrees. We know there are bad guys in  the area, a few shots have been fired but no big deal. We decide that we need air cover and the only thing in the area is a solo B-1 bomber. He flies around at about 20,000 feet and tells us there is nothing in the area. He then asks if we would like a low level show of force.  Stupid question. Of course we tell him yes.  The controller who is attached to the team then is heard talking to the pilot. Pilot asks if we want it subsonic or supersonic.  Very stupid question. Pilot advises he is twenty miles out and stand  by.    The controller gets us all sitting down in a line and points out the proper location.  You have to picture this. Pitch black, ten killers sitting down, dead quiet and overlooking this about 30 mile long valley.  All of a sudden, way out (below our level) you see a set of four 200' white flames coming at us. The controller says, 'Ah-- guys-- you might want to plug your ears'. Faster than you can think a B-1, supersonic, 1000' over our heads, blasts the sound barrier and it feels like God just hit you in the head with a hammer'. He then stands it straight up with 4 white trails of flame coming out and disappears.  Cost of gas for that: Probably $50,000  Hearing damage: For certain  Bunch of ragheads thinking twice about shooting at us: Priceless         "

A Dominican infant born with a second head will undergo a risky operation Friday to remove the appendage, which has a partially formed brain, ears, eyes and lips.   Ew, ew and ew.   Twins born conjoined at the head are extremely rare, accounting for one of every 2.5 million births. Parasitic twins like Rebeca are even rarer.   I wouldn't want someone operating on me who uses the  non-word; 'rarer'.  :/  But, I guess if I only made $200/month, I would shut my fucking mouth, instead of having a 'franken-baby' with two heads - especially in some 3rd world country.

Rebeca is the eighth documented case in the world of craniopagus parasiticus, said Dr. Santiago Hazim, medical director at CURE International's Center for Orthopedic Specialties in Santo Domingo, where the surgery will be performed.

"           Friday night:  Got kinda drunk @ home Saturday AM:   urlLink Memorial mountain bike ride for Mark Reynolds , with over 800 other riders.  For those of you not in the know, he was a local rider killed by a mountain lion about 5-6 weeks ago.  The same mountain lion (a couple days later) dragged another woman about 100 yards, by her head.  Fortunately, she lived - due to the assistance of her friend and some other riders who happened to be in the area.  Within a week, the offending mountain lion was shot and killed by a posse of Park Rangers/Sheriffs.  In any case, got to go riding (and chat a little) with  urlLink Hans Rey ,  urlLink Leigh Donovan  (who I used to have a HUUGE crush on) and  urlLink Brian Lopes .  Saw Hans clear this 'un-rideable' section of trail - one of the nastiest, steepest, loosest climbs I've ever seen.  I'll see if I can get a pic next weekend.    The group I rode with had done a 90 minute ride prior to the 'group memorial ride',  as those things usually chug along, and all the slow people (who think they're fast) like to try and hang with the big dogs, but then just get run over on the first hill.  Bleh.  In any case, I joined up with the fast group at the back of the pack, got bored real quick, and bolted to the front.  Had to pass about (literally) 300 people, but eventually got there.  That's where I met up with Lopes and Hans, and hacked it a bit.  Net net net, about 3.5 hours of ride time, which lined me up for a good 3 hour post-ride nap.  My ass was kicked.

Made some stylin french toast, and started to prep for the superbowl party.  Party went well - total sausage fest, but what do you expect?  My pats didn't cover the fucking 7 point spread due to that damn vinatieri, so I lost $70.  The kid I was betting with started to get pretty over-zealous, so there was a point where five of us were going to beat him senseless.  He caught wind through the grapevine that he was gonna get hurt if he didn't shut his fat mouth - so he got in line like a nice puppy.   Looks like things back home got  urlLink a little rowdy  too.

But, today, I actually have a rather large (18') ruler in front of me, so I head back to the Smith & Wesson site just to put it in perspective.  The barrel length on this beast is 10'+, the OVERALL length of the firearm = 18'.  That's longer than the keyboard I'm typing on, and is the full length of the ruler I've got in front of me.  One of the five rounds chambered in this gun, contains 2,600 lbs of muzzle 'force', one round is enough to stop a CHARGING BEAR.   UPDATE :  'You know, I sometimes work at the place where they make the depleted uranium tank armor.  Maybe I'll just put the word in and they can fab you some special bullets.  I'm sure that will only break about a dozen or so laws.' -P.         "

"           This reporter from some podunk town in BFE decides to  urlLink make a political statement  by 'apologizing' for the media's failure in not criticizing Bush's policies enough PRIOR to toppling Saddam.  All I've got to say to this guy is:  Shut your mealy mouth.    If you actually click that link and read it, I'd hope you'd be as disgusted as I am at the tone and the condescention evident therein.  Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for the appropriate word to describe the technique employed.  Too bad I'm so fat and stupid, right?    In any case, this jerk-off's final quote:  'there's no excusing that failure. The only thing that can be said is, Sorry.'  No, asshole, that's not the only thing left to be done.  Actions speak louder than your empty words (fucking reporters, eh?).  Here's the solution:  quit you fucker .  You failed.  You've been shamed.  You admitted it.  Now quit.  Get off the pulpit and go sulk home to mommy you fucking pussy.  Oh yeah, and while you're apologizing, why don't you reimburse your employer for the last two years of 'salary' you've stolen from them, you know, now that you've  ADMITTED TO FAILING THE JOB YOU WERE HIRED/PAID TO PERFORM .  Fucking asshole.  People like this are what's wrong with the world.   No accountability what-so-ever .  This dipshit is just gonna go back to doing whatever he was doing, with no accountability for his actions.  Word to the wise pal, an empty 'Sorry' sometimes just won't cut it.         "

"           Went out to  urlLink Chino Hills  with some of the  urlLink Team Basso  guys this morning.  Up at 6, small breakfast (my undoing), out the door by 7, riding by 8:30.  Rides with these guys typically go 12 miles or so - decent pace when you're actually riding, but some group members like to be more social than others - so you can rely on taking breaks every few miles or so.  What I'm tryin to say is the rides are never slug-fests.  After riding for a couple hours riding with the main pack (about 10 of us), we come to the fork in the road, easy home = left, more riding = right.  I'm feelin pretty good, crunching people on hills and I think I'm having a good day - so, right it is with 3 other guys.    At that point, its about 10:30 and heading into the hottest part of the day (hindsight = 20/20).  After dicking around being lost for about an hour or so, we find this 3.5 mile downhill run.  Sweet you say, save your energy... nope.  The rule in mountain biking goes, what you go down, you must go up.  Also, you gotta get your ass off the seat, which means all your weight is on your quads.  At the bottom of the hill we made the mistake of stopping - both my quads went out like Michael J. Fox in jenga.  I literally had to  punch  the back of my knee's to unlock the cramps.  Little did I know we probably had about 3,000 feet of elevation to climb.  LOL.  After borrowing a GU from a buddy, and stealing another's water, we set out on our way.  At this point, I've already stopped sweating (dehydrated), I'd had the chills for about an hour (dehydrated), was getting dizzy (dehydrated), and was about to  urlLink bonk  (not enough calories/sugar), all in 100 degree heat that isn't letting up (dehydrated).  My only thought, 'I'm fucked'.  Needless to say, I got home, and in the event you are writing this off as me being a drama queen, see below.       That's almost 4 beats per second folks.  Per  second .  If that  still  doesn't mean anything to you,  urlLink read this .     UPDATE :  The graph of my ride.

"            urlLink Don Watkins  was the first blogger I ever read, and the first person ever to link me, thus, I feel a special affinity for him and his blog.  Months ago his writing started to change, and I took a bit of a step back - it seemed like he was trying to figure out where he was trying to go with his blog.  He concluded that he was going to stop writing for the sake of writing (and focus on his book) - but would be writing when something motivated him.  I'm glad to see he has continued writing, and I think this recent post (linked above) is an absolutely fantastic piece.  I'm a rather scatter-brained individual, but I know what I want, I know what I like and, for the most part, I know how to get it.

"           A young and successful executive was traveling down a neighborhood street, going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar.    He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something.  As his car passed, no children appeared.   Instead, a brick smashed into the Jag's side door!    He slammed on the brakes and backed the Jag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car shouting,   'What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?  That's a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?'   The young boy was apologetic. 'Please, mister...please, I'm sorry but I didn't know what else to do,' He pleaded.  'I threw the brick because no one else would stop...' With tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car.   “It's my brother,' he said.  'He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up.' Now sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, 'Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.'   Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out a linen handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts.     A quick look told him everything was going to be okay.  'Thank you and may God bless you,' the grateful chid told the stranger.      Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.   It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar.   The damage was very noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door.  He kept the dent there to remind him of this message      'Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!'      God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us.      It's our choice to listen or not.         "

"           So,  urlLink my buddy  scored his friends  urlLink Cheyenne Turbo  for the weekend, and we're headed out to the  urlLink Darpa Grand Challenge  - the un-manned vehicle race from Barstow to Vegas.  WOOT WOOT!  I'll be sure to post some pics when I get back!   UPDATE :  Back yesterday.  The original format was set to be about 300 miles, which was then reduced to 150 miles - of which, the top-seeded competitor ( urlLink Red Team , our friends [ urlLink here's Nick ]) only finished 7 miles.  Ooof.  We heard a little bit about the course from the 'nav team' - 30 degree grades, switch backs up mountains, pretty ugly stuff.  We got the low-down that what killed red team was that the nav system (broken a week ago when they  urlLink flipped the bitch  in a training run, went a little haywire and sent the hummer into a couple fence posts, plowed them over, then into a few more metal poles, plowed them over,then it found something it couldn't quite knock down, so it got pent up on it - front axle got smashed.  Once stuck, the rear wheels kept spinning till they dug themselves a nice little hole in a gravel pit.  The computer kept 'driving' until it noticed the rear wheel had shredded and was on fire.  Oops.  We waited around for a few hours to see if we could get some pictures of the smashed vehicle - but they had serious trouble getting a flat bed tow truck out there given the terrain - so we never did get to see the havoc.

"           [Jacked from my post on the  urlLink R6 Message Net  - you can see responses there.]  Well, on valued recommendations I went out and bought two games for my computer last night.  I thought I was getting tired of diablo2, so figured some variety would help.  I purchased 'never winter nights gold' and 'unreal2' - for about $50 total (combined).  Let me just say, both suck my sweaty nuts. I expected the FPS to be a little easier (b/c it's made for retarded ADD children) - but it was just boring, and very stupid. Doesn't seem much has changed since the days of 'Doom' and 'Duke Nukem'.  Neverwinter nights is kind of a D&D game - so I expected strategy etc - it took me an hour to make my character. So, after I make my character (Boofy McBoofersen) I try to play the fucking game (you know, the reason I BOUGHT IT) - and I have to sit through fucking 45 minutes of bullshit text, and talk to 50,000 people, 50,000 times each, before I get to go kill shit. Then, what happens, I walk outside to try and kill a dog or the first thing I see - the GUI has about 10,000 options and I think a chicken killed me while I was trying to figure out wtf to do.  So, folks, save your fuckin money. I'm writing this off as a learning experience.  Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed in these games.  I tried again, today, to play U2 - I got about 5 minutes in and said 'fuck this'.  So, if anyone wants to buy either or both of these off me, let me know.         "

"           With all the flap going on about WMD in Iraq, I think this article found on  urlLink Slashdot  is worth mentioning.  It has to do with the CIA secretly sabotaging software the Russians  bought  (UPDATE: 'stole') to run their pipelines.  Opposition to this Administrations handling of the situation in Iraq is founded on the premise that we have not yet found WMD's - fair enough, as far as Joe Average/non-CIA knows.  What today's 'anti-Bush' crowd don't seem to understand is there were many many many reasons to depose of Saddam (womens rights, mass torture/murder, environmental issues to name a few) - however, b/c of the extreme ignorance of the American populous (admit it folks), the administration calculated it would pursue the avenue that would strike the *most* fear in your average American, hence our rationale became 'WMD proliferation'.  Does that mean they 'sexed up the dossier' as has been purported, or that 'Bush lied' - IMO, no, it simply means the President carefully selected his argument.  He consequently won 'the debate' too.  Hindsight being 20/20 doesn't mean shit - I think we can all  agree that with Saddam being gone, the world is a better place.  How all this ties into the slashdot article, is that people who do their homework also knew there were many more reasons to 'invade' Iraq.  In this instance (slashdot article) - we are only NOW (12 years later) finding out about  one  of the tactics our Government (under Reagan) used to cripple the Soviet Union.  According to 'today's' anti-Bush crowd argument, the government should have fully disclosed to  ALL  American Citizens what it intended to do to Russia, have Congress approve it, then have the UN ratify the action.  Honestly folks, how effective would that have been?  Same difference in going to the UN to actually enforce something pertaining to Iraq - I mean, we've already shown the extent of corruption within the UN, and how that pork-barrell bullshit flowed through to Hussein as well.  Intentions were compromised at our (as a Nation) expense.  Ridiculous, effing ridiculous.         "

Did you know:  1) More than 98 percent of convicted criminals are bread eaters ! 2) Exactly half of all children who grow up in bread - eating households score in the bottom 50% on standardized IQ tests ! 3) In the 19th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 55 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox and influenza ravaged entire nations ! 4) Statistics show that more than 75 % of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread ! 5) Bread is made from a substance called 'dough.' Researchers have proven that as little as one pound of dough can choke a large animal like a horse. The average person eats more bread than that in one month ! 6) Bread is known to be extremely addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water, actually begged for bread after just two days ! 7) Bread is a 'gateway' food item, which usually leads to such items as butter, jam, peanut butter and even ... bacon ! 8) Bread has been proven to kill. Scientists have now uncovered alarming evidence that 100% of the people who eat bread will eventually die ! 9) Unattended newborn babies can choke on bread ! 10) Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 425 degrees Fahrenheit ! Don't laugh...that kind of heat can kill a full grown adult in less than five minutes. 11) 96 % of cancer victims eventually admit that they've eaten bread !  File this under: The beauty of statistics.  (Thanks Mango!)  If you're wondering, W.T.F. is fat kid talking about now, he's eaten one too many crullers or something,  this all in response to  email pleas (see below) from a co-worker, begging for me (and all my co-workers) to give money to the 'Million Mom March' (I'm not even linking it for a number of reasons, the first being  it was conceived by a bored-ass housewife who saw coverage of Columbine on TV ) - a march protesting gun violence, the NRA, and our Second Amendment to name a few.  In any case, I'd let the first email go, b/c the woman propagandizing the march has had 2 kids killed in gang-related violence.  I don't know about you, but is it callous of me to recommend that you MOVE after the first one gets jacked?  Nah, that would be  smart .  Regardless, it happened, and I'm sad - but that doesn't give her  any  authority to disseminate BULLSHIT emails to the rest of the company trying to guilt us into giving money to a BULLSHIT cause that is trying to strip my freedoms.  So, as I mentioned, I let the first email slip - just talked to HR about it.  Then, the second, third, fourth and fifth emails came across my desk - from a couple people in that office.  W.T.F.   I'll see if I can round them up so you can get a flavor for what I'm dealing with here....  OK, fifth email first: =================================== As many of you are aware, XXX is active with the Million Mom March.  Many of us at the XXX platform would like to join together for this year's march, which is to be held on May 9 (Mother's Day), in support of XXX.  Anyone who wants to participate should register through the link listed below.  Registering only takes a couple of minutes on-line.  Please let me know if you intend to participate, since  we will be having t-shirts made for the event .  (Let me know t-shirt sizes and we will try to accommodate those requests as well...)    More information will follow about the event.   Those who cannot participate but who would like to make a donation are welcome to do so by sending a check payable to the Million Mom March  to me in the XXX office.  We will likely have other opportunities to contribute in support of XXX and her family in the future.  (emphasis mine)  Fourth email: =================================== In lieu of flowers, two suggestions for XXX would be to send in a donation to the Million Mom March, or to the XXX Memorial Gift Fund.  (See below.)   There also is discussion of doing something for XXX's grandaughter, with details to be worked out later.  This year's Million Mom March is to be held in Washington on May 9.  XXX, XXX, and I will be organizing a team of XXX people to march in support of XXX.   We will be providing more information next week on this event, and hope that many of those here locally will be able to participate.         "

"           B/c I don't feel like re-typing this - here's a brief synopsis of my weekend (via an IM convo):  animus949: check this animus949: race at 4,500 feet (kinda high) animus949: temperatures in the mid 90's animus949: noon start (my shift) animus949: working on a cold already animus949: not enough warm (heart rate sky rockets) animus949: i won the prologue (HR even higher) animus949: couldn't get HR *below* 190 for the first 5 miles animus949: dehydration sets in in lap one (figured this out later) animus949: by lap 2, calves had cramped, quads were gone, shins were gone and hams were on their way animus949: so i crased into a tree at 25 animus949: got impaled on a stick animus949: didn't know it was there till 6 miles later when i finished the lap animus949: that's no big deal, the big deal was my dehydration - within 2 hours of finishing i was dizzy, light headed, cold sweats and puking all over animus949: had to bum a ride to the hospital 25 miles away animus949: waited 6 FUCKING HOURS TO SEE A DOCTOR animus949: all while throwing up inthe lobby animus949: they pumped 5 LITERS of fluid into me before i even started to THINK about pissing animus949: usually it only takes people .5 liters animus949: i needed 10 times that animus949: spent the night there, went back to the race at 0800  Despite all this, out of 500 racers I still had a top 10 best lap time overall.  This is me in the hospital, at about 4:30 Sunday morning...     And some action shots from the race:  Me, hangin out about 10 minutes prior to the race starting.  No I'm not on a bike b/c this race started with a run of about 600 meters, followed by a 'parade lap' around the camp ground, then followed by a lap of the race course.    Me in the transition from run > bike during the prologue.    Me winning the prologue (not that it counted for anything).    End of lap two, later in the day - this was the stick that I go impaled on during my little 'get off into the tree' episode.  The stick went in my shorts, out my shorts and back into  my shorts.  No fvcking IDEA how that happened.  Also funny to notice you can see I'm getting notably more pale as the day went on - and check those bags under my eyes - lol.            "
"           Heading out to Idylwild, CA to compete in the  urlLink 24 Hours of Adrenaline .  Before you ask, no I'm not doing it solo - this will be a 5 man effort.  Each person completes one 11-mile loop, then gets to rest while the other guys ride.  Seeing as how I'm the 'young buck' of the crew, I get to go first (cluster fvck  le mans  style start - which means run a mile, parade loop around camp ground, then race a lap), and I also get to pick up the slack if, say at 0300, someone doesn't feel like riding.  Hah.  Should be a blast.  Expected total mileage for the 24 hours is between 60 and 70.  :D  I'm comin back Sunday, so don't expect posting until then at the earliest.  I'm also going to try and put together a photo-blog of the event, should definitely be bandwidth intensive.  Woo hoo.    Have a safe weekend and catch you on the flip side.          "
"           So, I'm sitting in my office, looking out at this overheating car in the parking lot - looks like this guys radiator blew up or something - he'd just pulled into this spare  urlLink parking space .  Next thing you know the smoke starts getting  urlLink thicker  &  urlLink thicker .  Until pretty much the whole car is  urlLink engulfed .  So, as you could see in the previous picture, the  urlLink fire department  rolls up and gets some water on it.    Here's what was  urlLink left over .  I went down afterwords to try and get a picture of the motor and the interior (which were completely scorched out - NOTHING left), but I felt a twang of conscience walking over with the camera.  I'd asked permission to take the pictures you see here, but when I walked down the second time, I felt  like a complete shit bag taking pictures of this kids car all burnt to a crisp.  All I could bring myself to ask was, 'What caused it' - apparently a fuel line.    Guess I can no longer say 'nothing fun happens to me' - b/c this was pretty damn random.            "
"           Looks like as an 'active blogger user' I'm eligible for a  urlLink GMAIL  account!!   Something I've been tryin to get for MONTHS!   effin SWEEEET!  Thanks  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink Google !  Alright, all you bitches need to  urlLink send me an email  (!!), I gotta get some base info for my filter to start kickin in.  I'm such.a.dork for being this excited about this. lol  UPDATE:  Holy god, the GUI is gonna take a little getting used to.  I'm *really* diggin the ability of the program to 'hide' or 'unhide' the email history - it allows you to see the first line of an email, and then hide all the other bullshit.   Conversation log example: I sent an email to my dad, then he responded, and I responded back again - the conversation log shows one message with a '(3)' next to it - so I can track back (in 1 place) all the messages with that subject header.  The only weird thing is that it also tracks who last responded (being 'ME') - so the way I'm used to reading email it looks like a sent file, as I have to look one person to the right to see who it was addressed to  (I'm not sure that made any sense....).  UPDATE #2:  Oops.  Ok, I fucked up, it doesnt track who the last two commenters were - it tracks the originator of the email, THEN the last commenter.  Cool.  I'm going to test this by sending an email to a list and have people comment to see how google treats the responses.   Again, another thing to note is there is no 'header' columns, like in Outlook (my normal email program).  You cannot sort by date, topic, file size etc.  The file size data sort is gonna be the one I'm going to miss - as I used that 'sort by' every once in a while.    More to come as I play with the application more.          "

"           Didn't intend for  urlLink my comments to this post  to be construed as a publicity stunt, but referrer logs don't lie.  I'll see if I can get a post together at some point in my busy day to discuss what I feel defines a true 'hero'.  FWIW I think this all comes down to the old liberal trick of bastardizing language ( urlLink case in point ) to justify means to an end.  For, unfortunately, I look around me these days, and I don't see any hero's.  Our ADD-ridden society is serverely deficient in the 'conviction' department, and to this jaded 25 year old, hero's appear to be a thing of the past.  Adding insult to injury, the more we try and seek hero's in our everday lives (to make ourselves feel better that we're not completely fucked) - the more we cheapen the concept and spiral further away from the essence of 'heroism'.  More to come.   I guess the best quick analogy I can come up with is the William Wallace example - the character Mel Gibson played in Braveheart.  I think this is the first image that comes to peoples minds when they hear about the defiant Italian who was un-ceremoniously  urlLink shot in the neck  by human filth, the same murder Al Jazeera is touting as 'too violent' for their animalistic audience.    An interesting thing was happening in the comments section of Allah's post noted above - people started calling this courageous soul a  hero .  While that was also my initial gut reaction, I changed my mind when I started thinking about it.  I empathize with the bandwagon jumpers - they want to make a martyr out of this man.  Whether your motivation is to get angry at Muslims, or feel superior to them, or simply to feel SOMETHING about what happened - we should put those things aside if we're going to label one man, above all other comers a hero.  What he did was defiant?  Yes.  Courageous?  Yes.  Noble?  Very much so.  Heart wrenching?  Fuck yes.  Heroic?  No.    I'd put forth the only argument that could be made that this man be recognized as a hero would be for his ability to view his situation with an unclouded mind, and recognize, with 100% clarity the extent of his situation and turn it into the absolute best thing possible.  However, in my opinion, that earns my deep-seated respect (and it's not an outburst I'll likely forget for the rest of my life - for this certainly is one of those things we'll tell our grandkids), but not the exalted title of Hero.

One thing about Gore, he doesn't disappoint.    And  urlLink the GOP's response :   Washington, DC—RNC Communications Director Jim Dyke issued the following statement today in response to a speech by former Vice President Al Gore attacking President Bush.  “Al Gore served as Vice President of this country for eight years. During that time, Osama Bin Laden declared war on the United States five times and terrorists killed US citizens on at least four different occasions including the first bombing of the World Trade Center, the attacks on Khobar Towers, our embassies in East Africa, and the USS Cole.”  “Al Gore’s attacks on the President today demonstrate that he either does not understand the threat of global terror, or he has amnesia.”  Heh.

"           So, this girl on myspace posts the following from Michael Moore: Monday, March 17, 2003 A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush on the Eve of War  George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC  Dear Governor Bush:  So today is what you call 'the moment of truth,' the day that 'France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table.' I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:  1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!  2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve.  3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.  4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.  5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!  6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.  Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you 'win' the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good %@!$&-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world %@!$&!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!  But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!  Yours,  Michael Moore To which I responded: Sorry, but Michael Moore is a  urlLink fat, smelly, douche bag  To whit she responded:  ok, so why don't you like m.m.? I think the guy tells it how it is most of the time. Did you know disney is censoring his movie? How do you think this reflects on our rights? You prolly like Bush too don't you? Just curious to know what you think And my response?  urlLink Censored ?  Sorry babe.  His 'stunt' aside, Disney is not a governmental organization. They have every right to NOT pay Michael Moore for his movies. Just like you have every right not to watch it. Disney, acting in their own best interest, decided that they would not *distribute* the movie (which they've now gone back on I might add). Technically, Miramax funded the movie, Disney owns Miramax - that's the extent of the relationship. Disney doesn't have Moore tied up in some backroom, or have a gun to his head telling him what to (and what not to) say. If Miramax, or Michael Moore, for example, wanted to distribute the movie on their own dime, no one is stopping them. Moore's a multi-multi-multi millionaire. If he wanted to get it done, he could. Think Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ - worked good for him, right?  In any case, all I'm sayin is do your homework if you're gonna come back with a retort. Or, you could just swallow every hunk that fat fucktard spews out for your consumption without questioning a word of what he says - despite the fact that he admits he goofs on his sheeple (see link above).  BTW, what I *think* or how I *feel* has nothing to do with Mr. Moore being a big fat liar. THAT is a fact. ;) Stupid Bitch:0    Fat Kid:1         "

"           For those of you who didn't already know, I ride a motorcycle, an R6 specifically.

Or, sitting on the tank with your legs over the front, and your GF driving the bike from your seat - basically not.smart.stuff.  I avoid doing shit like that for a number of reasons: 1) I'm not that coordinated, 2) I have this fear of falling off and getting run over by a car (call me a pussy if you must) and 3) it's just stupid.  However, I can let some of that stuff pass b/c those guys aren't endgangering (for the most part) other people.  Odds are if they fall off in traffic, they're not going to hurt the driver who runs them over.   urlLink This guy OTOH, should be tarred and feathered .  What an effing retard.         "
"            urlLink All of it . So they found a sarin shell? Eh. Halliburton put it there, it was old, and besides everyone knew Saddam had WMD, and we gave him the sarin anyway, and it would be news if we found 400 shells, but if they were old undeclared shells they wouldn’t count because they weren’t a threat to us anyway – do you know that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? Why aren’t we invading them? Not that we should, that would TOTALLY be about oil, anyway , did you read Doonesbury today? He had this giant hand talking in a press conference. This big giant floating hand. I think it was a reprint. I like when he has that bald dude who’s in charge of some Iraqi city. Bald dude is like, wasted.   The story of the prison abuse might have had a different impact if the media had chosen a different tack. The only news that hits the front page is bad news; the innumerable small fragments of good news don’t make A1 because papers have their standards, you see. We are expected to repair Iraq’s dilapidated electrical grid, so replacing an old generator and turning on the power to a neighborhood that’s had brown-outs for ten years is not news. Two Marines dead in an ambush is news because A) death leads, and B) that “mission accomplished” aircraft carrier photo op needs to be debunked, however subtly, as often as possible. The media has come to believe that reporting more good than bad somehow makes them suspect; it goes contrary to The Mission, which is to find out what’s wrong.           "

"           First off, let me just say that I love Jeff Jarvis, however his continued  urlLink shameless promotion of Iraqi bloggers  kind of weirds me out.  Dunno why, it just seems like every time I check his blog, he's got some new post trying to get Iraqi bloggers picked up by mainstream news sources.  I thought what they were doing was present themselves as an ALTERNATIVE to mainstream media.    Having them on the payrolls of these organizations (IMO) would probably compromise their objectivity.  Even if it's not explicit, the editors desk will provide for an implicit censor - not what these guys need, or us even for that matter.         "

Tony Blair is still in office.  I've said it before, and it's worth repeating.  It really is stupid to be passing such quick judgement on our progress in Iraq, people don't just say 'Hindsight is 20/20' for the fuck of it.  Only in the coming 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years will we see the true ramifications of what we've done here.  My stance on the war is that, within those timelines our actions will be seen as a major positive.    Compound that with the stance of the anti-war left, with their nanosecond by nanosecond attention span (or lack thereof), and it becomes clear to see what it is that frustrates me so much with them.

'The fact of the matter is, the casualties were high, the same kinds of concerns that we're expressing here were expressed then.' The people then, Mr. Rumsfeld said, 'were despairing, they were hopeful, they were concerned, they were combative.'   But in the end, he concluded, 'the carnage was horrendous, and it was worth it .' It will be a sad sad sad day in American history the day Donald Rumsfeld is forced from office due to partisan bickering.         "

"           And maybe this can help explain how furious I get when a liberal opens their stupid ass retarded mouth, some choice quotes from the R6MessageNet - a motorcycle messageboard I frequent:  This first one's about the Marine who recently received the Navy Cross, that nobody heard about on the news: I read the citation above in the story and just wondered if the guy runs for president as a democrat in 30 years or so, will the citation be questioned along with whether he really did kill as many enemy as suggested, etc.   Quote:  That's definitely a nice change... But alas, the American News Media only tells us what they want us to hear, and apparently True Acts of Heroism aren't 'News' to those who provide it.   Well maybe the next time one of you retards wants to blame the 'liberal media' () you should realize that bad news sells newspapers, not sappy crap.  Who wants to see 30 stories of schools being rebuilt*, and see nothing but pictures of smiling Iraqi kids? Fundies and people so slanted that thats what theyre seeing anyway, thats who.  Its called human nature, folks.   And FYI, spin goes both ways.  * - rebuilt, not built. Think of the difference.   Again, just some bullshit from two hippies in CO, both are disgruntled tech employees who're feeling rather inadequate I'd guess.  If you feel like checking out the source doc's for these posts, they're as follows:  urlLink Post 1 .  urlLink Post 2 .

Brings new meaning to that old Marine joke:  Have you heard the joke about the Marine who was in Iraq? He was below a sand dune, a very high sand dune. And he yelled over that sand dune, 'One Marine is worth 10 Iraqi soldiers.' The commander on the other side of the hill said, 'I need 10 volunteers.' Ten volunteers, they went over the dune. Yelling and screaming and smoke and gun fire and then silence.  The voice came again, 'One Marine is worth 50 Iraqi soldiers.' The commander sent 50 soldiers. Went over the dune and the same thing, yelling, screaming, smoke, fire, gunshots and then silence.  The voice came again. 'Ha. One Marine is worth 100 Iraqi soldiers.' Again the commander asked for 100 soldiers. A hundred soldiers went over the dune. Yelling screaming, firing, gunshots. Then silence.   Then the voice came again. 'One Marine is worth 1,000 Iraqi soldiers.' The commander asked for 1,000 soldiers. They went over the dune. Yelling, screaming, gunfire, shots. But this time, one Iraqi soldier, his arm badly wounded, holding it against his side, his leg badly limping, came up over the dune. And he said to his commander, 'Don't send any more soldiers. He lied. There's two of them.'    Makes you wonder if  urlLink al Sadr  heard the joke.  Heh.

Kerry claims that Secretary Rumsfeld should be held personally responsible for the actions of a few soldiers in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison who humiliated a group of the captive terrorists in their search for 'actionable intelligence.' This is the same John F. Kerry, by the way, who has alternately employed claims of his Vietnam wartime heroism and wartime criminality to catapult himself into the highest echelons of public life over the past three decades. Kerry's irrational call for Rumsfeld's resignation, harkening back to his days as a Vietnam War protestor, is anything but out of the ordinary for the 'gentleman from Massachusetts'.  Kerry claims his petition received about 250,000 signatures. Act now to refute this political folly and support Secretary Rumsfeld.  Today, PatriotPetitions.US, the nation's leading public opinion advocate for U.S. national security and sovereignty, has released its newest campaign entreating the President and Congress to support Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Please register your support for Secretary Rumsfeld.  Let your voice be heard!  Please join fellow Patriots on the front lines in defense of our liberty and national sovereignty.

Organizers this time put the crowd at close to 3,000, a figure that could not be confirmed because police no longer estimate crowd sizes.

"           So, I was watching the season finale of ' urlLink All Star Survivor ' last night with the roommates, and somewhere between glass of wine #4, 6 and beer # something, I decided it was a good idea to call the boss and tell him I was going to be coming in around noon today.  Apparently I left a nice rambling drunken message wishing my boss, Tony, a happy mothers day.  Tony's a guy,  urlLink flaming , but a guy.  Fortunately, he got a kick out of it, and I still have a job.  I did however, miss his birthday luncheon due to my hangover.    Oops.  And, for those of you coming in from Lagmonkey, I'll apologize now for the lack of 'hot chick' pictures, I kept a relatively low profile this weekend - however I'm going to see if I can get some pics from my buddy Aaron of the club we went to Saturday night.  I spent most of the weekend helping a buddy move into a new house, which I'll also post pictures of as soon as I go and take some (heh).  All I gotta say about the house is $3.5 million with a $500,000+ renovation budget.  O.M.F.G.         "

"            Firstly, let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him 'visionary' and 'gifted' and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays!   Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck.

(Tillman's Choice: there's a phrase that sums up quite a lot, doesn't it?) People like Rall are sitting on the curb, feet in the gutter, watching the parade go past, smirking at the guy with the baton, sneering at the cheerleaders. Everyone else watching the parade thinks I wonder if there will be elephants! And when they do appear, he rolls his eyes. Elephants. How obvious.  You want to live like that? I don't want to live like that. Because when you see red all the time you miss things. My favorite panel of the cartoon had Tillman signing up and asking 'Do I get to go kill Arabs.' Of course Rall knows that it's not literally true, but it's true in some metaphysical sense, which makes it truer than reality itself. And it's a bitter joke, don't you know, because that's the unspoken subtext, isn't it? ' Damn.  This guy's good.  What makes this especially good is he's touched on something that I see in myself: ...when you see red all the time you miss things. Life goes by too fast to miss things.         "

These working middle-class tax-paying citizens will soon be living out on the street,  urlLink what good will the tax cuts for the rich do for them then , huh  urlLink Hitler ?  Huh!  In addition, the increased interest rates will serve as a dis-incentive for business to invest in capital items, in turn plunging the economy futher into a quagmire.

Perhaps a bit too in your face with Moore's opinion--but any adult with half a brain can take the facts from the speculation--we do this every day when we watch the news.  Either way--your bulletin entry is silly--and I am telling everyone I know regardless of their party affiliation to go see the film. Until you do--you know nothing about it, or the brilliance of the documentary itself.

We call him 'The Terminator'.  Total.fucking.animal. +++++++++++  first, i'd like to send out a hearty thanks to all who have taken an interest and supported me this year in my build up to olympic trials.  it was an honor to race at an event of such magnitude and i'm thrilled i was able to represent team psycho this weekend.   in the two weeks leading up to the race, and in the race itself, things went either very well, or very badly.  i capped an intense training build up the week prior to the race with a PR at the Harpoon 5 miler (good), only to suffer a recurrance the next day of the lung inflammation i've been dealing with (bad).  i felt that a week of recovery would be enough to overcome this setback but found that on race morning i was still having lung troubles.   it was difficult to dwell on the negative though b/c i had made it despite all of the setbacks i've been dealt this year.  only 15 men started, and of those there were 10 americans, 4 kiwis, and 1 brazilian.  each of us were individually introduced and called out onto the pontoon through a narrow gateway.  the race coverage was intense, with a helicopter above us for the entire race, and underwater divers fliming us during the swim.   a minute of so into the swim my lungs started to tighten up.  i couldn't find my top end, had to settle for a choppy tempo, and i exited the water almost two minutes down on the rest of the field.  (results are at triathlon.org)  the first two laps of the bike were also a struggle, but i started to find a rhythm about 20 minutes in.  the crowd on the one huge climb of the day (a 3 min. climb were i used my 28 rear cog each time up) was in my face the whole time, and i couldn't help but think that this was the closest thing to riding up a col in the tour de france that i would ever experience.   on lap five i finally closed the gap to the chase group up the road.  this is where my race suddenly went from very bad to very good.  riding solo is not a good use of energy in a draft legal race so i made good use of the draft for the final lap and came into transition slightly recovered.  i ran as hard as i could knowing that i had crawled my way back into the race, and i finished 8th overall, 5th american.   i don't generally spend too much time digesting my races philosophically.  but this race has so far resonated with me like no other.  i've had, by most accounts, a disasterous early 2004 season.  i missed two early season races, olympic trials in honolulu, and countless training sessions dealing with health issues.  i mananged to requalify for trials, and i finally put together two weeks of consistent training, only to suffer yet another setback the week leading up to the race in bellingham.  and in ITU races when you're almost two minutes back exiting the water, your race almost always over.   but i did not give up earlier this year, and i did not give up on sunday.  i'd like to take the credit for doing all the work on race day, but the truth is that racing for a team that has so graciously supported me these past two years really does put wind in your sails when it seems all is lost. and when you represent a group of people dedicated to getting the most out of triathlon, quitting is just not option.  the reservoir of psycho karma has grown larger each year, and i'd like to think that i tapped into that source on a day when the tank was empty.

Nobody does it better.  If his 'Bleat' is not a daily 'must read' for you, your life is that much poorer without your even knowing it.  Seriously.  An observation from today's Opinion Jounal: Stanley's colleague Adam Nagourney tries to find hope for the Democrats: 'Some Republicans said the images of a forceful Mr. Reagan giving dramatic speeches on television provided a less-than-welcome contrast with Mr. Bush's own appearances these days, and that it was not in Mr. Bush's interest to encourage such comparisons.'   Well, maybe. Certainly Bush isn't as eloquent as Reagan was. Then again, neither is John Kerry. When Bush speaks, you often imagine Reagan might have said the same thing better. When Kerry speaks, you imagine Reagan would disagree--assuming he could even figure out what Kerry was saying.    Update:  Holy shit, I've got  urlLink tears in my eyes .           "
"           Spent about 2 hours yesterday trying to fix the elevator in my buddy's house.  Apparently someone pulled the door frame out of the wall (just an inch or so) and the elevator got stuck between floors.    My initial thoughts were that, since the elevator moves slow as fuck, someone was drunk, got tired of waiting for it, and yanked on the door that closes off the empty shaft a little too hard - thereby tripping a fuse or something.  Just got the update, someone stopped it in between floors,  urlLink got their fuck on , then couldn't 'un-stop' the elevator, had to kick open the door from the inside, and boogied out of the party.

"            urlLink DRUDGE REPORT FLASH 2004�   Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of Fox News, writes in the Wall Street Journal (6/2, A14). 'John S. Carroll, the editor of the Los Angeles Times, recently gave a speech at the University of Oregon, in which he attacked Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel and me, the chairman of Fox News.  However, Mr. Carroll obviously did not feel particularly restricted by facts, truth or sources. In an effort to use guilt by association, he compared me to Sen. Joseph McCarthy without evidence, sourcing or analysis. An old, cheap trick used by weak writers and thinkers. Mr. Carroll essentially announced that the reason Fox News Channel is the No. 1 cable news network and is gaining viewers is because the American people are stupid and gullible. In addition, he deliberately confused our highly rated news analysis and opinion shows like Bill O'Reilly with our hard news coverage.'  Ailes adds, 'Mr. Carroll's pathetic attempt to smear Fox News Channel will only drive his paper's circulation down, as it should. Fox News Channel's audience in Los Angeles is increasing daily. The Los Angeles Times is becoming less relevant in people's lives, so Mr. Carroll is trying to flog health back to a newspaper by attacking television news. ... He owes the fine journalists at the Fox News Channel an apology for his insulting comments. However, we will never see that. He treated Fox News Channel worse in his newspaper than he treated the terrorists who recently beheaded an American. But of course, he sees Fox News as more dangerous.'          "

Can you believe this?!? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build a road for chickens to cross.    MARTHA STEWART  No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level.

They don't immediately mention, however, that the ammunition for the beast costs $40 for 20 rounds.  /kickinthenuts  I'll save that for when I have friends to share the burden, or at least take pics of me laughing my balls of when I shoot it - the gun that's designed to basically kill any non-armored (metal plates) living thing on the face of this earth.  Well, maybe an exaggeration, but it is designed to kill any game animal - including bears and boars, two of the nastier animals I can think of.  I wonder what it'd do to a blue whale, not that you'd want to shoot one... but, you know...         "

"           Cruising along I-5, about to hit my exit, when all of a sudden I see what looks like a lady shaking her fists in anger in front of me.  Nothing out of the normal says I, CA drivers suck.  Next thing I know, this woman start swerving off the road, mind you this lady *was* 15 ft in front of me, we were moving along at about 40-45 mph in traffic.  I back off, thinkin 'WTF is this lady doing' - the very next thing, she goes off the road, takes out a call box, a  urlLink 50 ft light pole , continues to swerve across the merging 2 lanes, goes flying off the road, through a ditch and into some bushes!!!!   WTF   Myself and 4 other cars pull over, this lady is still on the gas.  Only reason she's not moving is b/c the wheels are off the ground.  Fortunatly her stroke was over by the time we got to her, and she was just kind of hangin out.  The front windshield held up, so she wasn't a bloody mess.  The rear of the car didn't do so well, as you can see.          Sorry for the crappy image quality, they're from my camera phone.  I didn't want to take more b/c I felt like I was gawking.  Which I hate.         "
"           Hope all y'all had a great weekend.  Though the weekend had it's ups and downs, overall some very good shit.  Spent much of the time hangin with Geoff down at the Laguna House and his beach house.  We spent yesterday cruisin the boardwalk on the bikes, and gettin into mischief.  Geoff was so kind as to provide me with about 40 sets of beads, which by the end of the day were gone, and I'd seen about 35 pairs of lucious titties.  A beautiful thing...  In any case, I did want to share with y'all the results of my 'bike fight' with Jesse yesterday.  Somewhere along the line I think we decided it would be fun to start hurling bikes at eachother.  Attempting to avoid a beach cruiser that was hurtling at my head, I somehow did  urlLink this  to my  urlLink foot .  Think it's broken much?  The Doc should be able to give the official word, but you tell me where the smart money's playin.  ;)  Excuse the dirty tape marks, I found a physical trainer last night somewhere along the line and she taped me up with some industrial stuff, and it's a little too tender this morning/afternoon to remove all the tape-shit.

Nothing like exploiting 'terrorism' to further your budgetary outlook for next year, eh 'scientists'.  You know who should be focusing their energy on this, as opposed to, say, pursuing nuclear weapons, India.  How many of those mofo's die each year b/c of monsoons or tidal waves - I bet high 6 digits, if not 7.  All you have to do is go read some of the geo-political strategy reports that have been coming out these last few years - the US is pretty much the best-positioned country in the world to deal with any kind of severe natural catastrophe.  All this airport screening shit is doing nothing but helping us prepare for some 'big natural catastrophic event'.  For those of you who *haven't* read the reports I'm talking about (I'll try and find links later) - they basically say, in the event of some dramatic global climate change (poles reversing, etc.) it's going to be countries with wealth, land and natural resources that will thrive.  The problem will be immigration, little insignificant countries like France, where 10,000 people died last summer b/c it was  HOT  are going to witness violent street protests and societal upheaval.  So long welfare state.  Nevermind countries like in sub-saharan Africa, or the middle east.  LOL.

"           So, last night went down to Carlsbad to Keri's little BBQ thing - had a great time, got really shitfaced and ended up talking politics with a few Navy dudes, and Keri's liberal best friend.  Oops.  Turns out the Navy dudes felt the same way about JFK as I do - we'd like to give him a  urlLink cleveland steamer .  Well, little miss liberal had a differing opinion - I don't remember much of the argument, but I think it ended in raised voices, me feeling like an asshole and everyone else deathly quiet.  Or something.  Heh.  In any case I did meet some totally cute chick, Julia, who had the raddest ink on her stomach I've ever seen.  Not sure that I remember what it is, but it sure was cool.  It probably helped that she was fucking hot.  So, around 2 I decide that it would be a great idea if I drove home, after having a bottle of wine and damn close to a six pack of Sierra Nevada.  It goes without saying it was a pretty hairy 45 mile drive home.  A stunt I won't soon be repeating, believe you me.  Given that it's already a late night, I got home around 2 or so, I decide to haul off and check my myspace account to see whats up.  Got a few messages from some cuties, so I log into AIM/Yahoo to see if anyone's on - b/c I'm feelin frisky.  Turns out two are on.  Woop, here comes the webcam.  Next thing I knew it's 0400, I'm starin down the barrel of a mean fucking hangover, a long day at the office, inability to form a coherent thought (look no further than this post), a case of the shits and no clothes to wear for work in a couple hours.    Fuck. Me.    Not good prospects.    In any case, go listen to Slipknot 'Before I forget' - it owns you.          "
"           Drug my roommate away from his incessant studying for about an hour this morning, to go shoot  urlLink this beast .    Well, feel free to call me a pussy, but my wrist is friggin sore from shooting  10 ROUNDS .  With a box of 20 rounds costing $40, I wasn't about to haul off and buy too much ammo - no friggin need, and I have bills to pay.  Regardless, this thing is out of control -  urlLink it makes shooting my .45 feel like plinking , however the gun is totally controllable.  I was expecting the thing to buck back and hit me in the face on recoil - no such thing.  The gun recoils almost straight back, and as you can see in the vids, the upward kick is limited to maybe 30 degrees.  Very cool.   Below are two vids of me and my roommate shooting this supreme American piece of ingenuity.   Forgive the quality/resolution of the vids, they were taken from my POS cell phone, as my cam battery is dead.  After you've DL'd them, you can always just make them bigger through quick time.      urlLink Me, acting the fool  ( rt. click > save as )  I was actually hoping P would take a vid of everyone's responses as I took my first shot.  Apparently the 10 other people at the range stopped what they were doing, looked at eachother and quizzically announced a collective 'WTF was that?!?'.  A couple dudes walked over, and indicated with their best 'it was THAT big' pose that I was shooting something that was clearly larger than my penis...  moving on...  Here's a  urlLink close up vid of Pat  ( rt. click > save as ) putting a few holes through the target at 15 or so yards.  And yes, that's me giggling like a bitch at his first shot - this gun is comical, like something out of an old comic book.  It actually took me about 5 minutes to contain myself before firing the first round - I couldn't stop laughing at this 5 lb+ gun, with ammunition I can almost fit my pinkie finger in, which can fire a 1 oz slug at  sixteen hundred and fucking sixty five feet per fucking second  - which is approximately two times the speed of sound, which is approximately twice as fast as the rounds chambered in my HK .45.  Oof.         "

"       Famous people are weird aren't they?? Its like they're not real people. I just went to the Craig David concert and the show was good (not as good as Prince mind you but I like Craig David better, and yes I went to that one twice on the weekend.)  The show was good, he was good, the seats were excellent!!..  It was all in all a good night... There was some trash on parade though, the outfits of some of the people were shocking!! Not to mention the ages, there was heaps of young girls and older people too. He reaches all people.. which is cool...  Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I think fame is a weird concept. We waited after the concert to see Craig David come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did. It was very weird to see him in person, in full view and in a normal setting, walking around, getting into a car.   And it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that..,.... I don't know what I'd be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping, even for groceries..   I guess we take stuff like that for granted.. I don't know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely..   And all those fans, wanting to know things about you, everything, to see you and hear you.. theres a bitter irony to it all...  but i guess i'll never know because I am not waiting to be famous, i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous..   Prince was also a strange thing to see. We could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal.. The show was much more 80s and funky, and the band was great.. Also, Prince ended up being on for 2 and 1/2 hours but Craig David was only on for 1 and 15 I think.. but he has less songs.  At Prince  everyone danced ... at this one, the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up..   For the Prince concert I went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time.. he enjoyed it so much and I liked seeing him having fun, dancing and singing. That was on last friday night, the 24th.  Then the next night the 25th I worked at it and went in after with friends. It was less packed and had less of a party vibe.. so I was definitely glad that i went the first night..   So now am relaxed but had a big day, i'll write more later when I have the time..            "
"       Phew!!!  what a day./.....   Its week 12 at uni this week, so I am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading, questions and learning..  Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, 'am i hearing this right?'.. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P         "
"       Just in case anyone is wondering.. (no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease)..  I didn't end up going out on the day of my birthday (which I said I was in my last blog before todays bloggs.) Because none of my friends could make it  - I ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw Lara Croft Tombraider and ate Vietnamese in George st .. it was a nice date, and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers, the most beautiful, romantic flowers ever, two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks.. (shes a close girlfriend too) and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers, drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever!!! Hehehe it was funny!!!     There was one point in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets, and this girl approached him when I was inside, and gushed over the flowers and him!!! Heheh.....   But last night was a nice surprise.. it was about a week since the actual birthday, and last night went to the pub with school friends, as my friends from work couldn't make it..   But they surprised me and turned up and it was great!! They are the best, and the presents they got me are so nice I love them..   So thats how my birthday panned out.. (not that anyone is reading this... ??)            "
"       Argh.. so tired today. Went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat dj's set afterward... didn't get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish...  They asked me what I wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds (which i requested) and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year. Its pretty cool - its a surf brand one. But its just not really my style. But it is the thought that counts..  though.   I was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere..   Its been a busy week..i got a lot done - i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special..  also went to gym twice, worked two days and attended all classes, tutorials, and had my final commerce presentation ever... and handed in a 3000pg group report..  yay!!   going to rest now... @_@ i feel like a zombie... >.

"       Going to bed, have a long day tomorrow.  Working in the city, then meeting some new friends from Uni for drinks in the evening. I am looking forward to it very much..          "
"       My birthday is coming up (23) and I am feeling very bah humbug about it. I don't really want to be older, I want to stay as I am, because I know that I am unprepared.. Coinciding with my birthday is the return of Uni and I know that it will be busy.   There's so much going on in my life right now that sometimes I feel like i can't breathe...  I went to the John Mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd (it was a sold out event) it was strange that I experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually I have been feeling for awhile.   I felt cramped in, hot, like my skin couldn't breathe, and just weary overall..   But it was the best concert I have been to to date.... entirely worth it..           "
"       I'm finally here.. I have a blog. Very cool...           "
"       If anyone is wondering, when I say ' there ', I mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up.  But do you ever get  there ? and what  is it ? Is it finishing high school? finishing Uni? Getting into a relationship?  I'm 23 and I always thought my life would be different to what it is now. I always thought I would have done so much by now, yet sometimes I feel like I've done nothing. I'm not there yet.. when will i get there?  When I was away, in KL, my cous said a funny thing. She was talking about her future (she has youth on her side) and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25. A house, a car, a high paying job. I laughed at her, and told her what the world really was like, that I was 23 going on 24 and had no house, a junky car and two lowly paying jobs, and no chance of getting them by the time I hit 25. She looked at me in disbelief as if I was lying to her, and I didn't know what to say. They were so important to her, I guess that was her 'it', her getting 'there' was 'it'.   I know that those things aren't important, maybe if I had them already I would think so, but I would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future.  I am dying to get away from this place, and see the world. More than just asia, I'd like to travel to Europe, Africa and America, to see what its like there. here, especially where my parents live, its a suburban existence. I go to the local malls and feel out of place because I don't have a pram with babies in it. Two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much. Lots of other people have asked me why, but to me its crystal clear - marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world, and entering into the 'suburban' part of your life. when you're married there's more than just you, and you sort of disappear into that.  For me, at this stage, I think thats 'it'; not getting caught up in the suburban existence; i'd rather be doing something life changing, for myself, that  I  want. Before that (suburban existence- husband, house and kids) I want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries, away from everything that is here and that I have always been used to..... and thats  it !!!           "
"       HiHi! Basically, I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring, Sorry Charmaine!)  She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months, which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL, it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only!!  Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all. So this is essential to our keeping in touch..   The last few months, ok three (? i think) have gone past very quickly. I've been away from Sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and  it felt so  goood ...  I love travelling and seeing new things. Coming back has been a little hard actually, because it means i have to do things and get back 'on the ball'... just litle things, like the pile of mail, were hard to deal with, i open it, look at it, then put it back down.. have become really lazy and non correspondive (i know its not a word but ya know).. but the good news is that things are happening slowly. I have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say I am up to date!! I threw away so much stuff I was ruthless!!  On the return journey I got sick, and got a cold so thats also why i haven't been doing anything, - the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness.. then it turned into a bronchial cough, which i still have at times...   But about KL, I love it. Thats where I went and spent my time, with my family (aunties and cousins and uncles..) ..The shopping is awesome, and the food is also great. Its like they are more on par with America in some ways - just the franchise chain stores they have there are really American, like hot dogs, pretzels (we have those here i know) and others (they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great! really crispy!)  Also the supermarkets are huge!! and the mallssssssss!!   But the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age (puberty  - all between 10-20) where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly! And Jay and I saw straight through them - don't know if its about the down to earthness of Australia or just my family..  Being back is a little tiring, cause I know that its back to the daily grind, wish I could escape and run away!!  Haven't worked much at all, both my workplaces seem to not have any work - its quite at TT and DM has already rostered everything up until March-  so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session. By chance, got a  job interview  tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for, so feeling abit nervous about it. Its a law firm so I am not exactly feeling confident.. and uni is finishing soon (6 mths) and then who knows?!... its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all. Gotta try it...Can only try..   Anyway, thats all for now, sorry its so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehehehe catch up more soon...             "
"       Does this count as a hobby?   I have decided, that I am going to become a person who has many hobbies. I've been feeling a little 2-D lately, partly cause a new friend asked me if I had an online journal, and i thought I did but after visiting his mine seems so.. well, 2D. I don't know if I want to show this to him.... his site was pretty good, it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him.. and it got me thinking, what are my interests? what are my hobbies? I guess I just never thought about it before.  That may sound sad,  but when I asked my brother if he thought I had any hobbies, he flatly replied,  'your hobbies are friends and work'.  ahem.  Boring!! There's so much to me than that! Isn't there?  Music, concerts, Books, Games, AND friends and work i guess.  Well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year, and i'm sure it will be too this year. Last year I saw Groove Armada, John Mayer, Michelle Branch and (not really my choice but circumstancial attendance)  Prince, Shaggy and Craig David.  I guess thats somewhat attached to work though, so does that make it a hobby still??   And i went to tropfest last week, which was excellent!! it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine, cheese, and other miscellaneous picnic food. It was great, lounging around watching the short films.. great stuff.  So I guess I do have hobbies,  and interests, just don't have a site about it.            "
"       I had a great weekend. Bianca is back from Moree and there are lots of social activities happening! Drinks Friday night, got very trashed and sent out some drunkend sms and took P & D (formerly P & T, who is still a little upset) to meet my friend Peter at his work. I was a little trashed, on the way home ate 3 burgers (thats so gross) and so began a bad spell of late night eating binges. Stayed over in the city, went home the next day and that night went to the John Mayer concert at the Entertainment Centre.. it was the best thing ever! I love John Mayer, and so do alot of other girls and women..   But the lyrics, they are the best.. and I wish I had written down his set so i could remember it better, I was so scared I'd forget about it when I was watching him. We had excellent seats, mine was directly in front of him, first elevation entertainment centre.  Awesome Awesome... i bought the live CD any given thursday, and a sticker for my brother... A friend of mine surprised me with a ticket it was so lovely..  but we went for supper after (bad) and had korean (which was good) but I didn't get home till about 2, then had to get up to work at brookvale the next day.. (tiring)..   I have been floating around with a sea of John Mayer lyrics in my head all day.. and was all weekend..    'If only my life was more like 1983'     Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my lunchbox? When came the day that it got  thrown away and don't you think i should have had some say  in that decision.........    He also talked quite a bit.. i really like him, he has a funny sense of humor and this way about him that is familiar.. He was doing an impersonation of his mother it was so funny.. you can tell that he's really clever and witty... quite taken with that.. want to go to New York to see the city he lives in, if it has the same vibe.. and want to try to explore some  more music.. jazz especially.. *sigh*...

"       Wow.. Time has flown, I have done so many things in the past few weeks don't know where to start. Well, I got the job at the law firm, and am there 3 days part time helping them out answering phones and photocopying, filing etc.. mail run in the afternoons after lunch.. its easy work sometimes hectic and the ladies are really nice (its actually an all female office, and one man). They are all Malaysian Chinese which is funny cause I have never worked in that kind of environment, but only had dinner parties family things in that type of environment. Lorraine one of the solicitors brought in curry puffs the other day and they were so nice! And Florence is from HK, she is always going for milk tea and they always buy me one!  But have been really tired the past week cause Ticketek has been pretty busy. Poor Dave I have been no picnic this week.. Last weekend I worked all weekend and this weekend I also worked, the Easter show is on at the moment and its been pretty hectic, I have been supervising lately so its a bit nerve wracking having people actually look to you for advice all the time.   But today I went out with Brian, Deepa, Katie and Carol (Brians flatmates). They are so funny and Carol had never seen the Opera house or Harbour Bridge so I made us go there - she liked it. We had dinner at Darling Harbour and also had yum cha at Chinatown in the morning.. The thing is, they spoke Mandarin alot and it was a litte confusing, I felt so left out and can't imaging how Deepa felt, I actually had to interrupt them and ask them what they were speaking about at dinner tonight. I felt so rude but they shouldn't have been speaking in front of us like that, especially with Deepa there. The fact that she came is quite refreshing, that she is willing to make contact like that and go out of her comfort zone to hang out with me was so endearing. Shes such a sweetheart.   Bee's back from Moree, and its so good to see her again. We went to the Easter show yesterday and it was sooo much fun. Me and Dave and Annie and Bee went on the ferris wheel and Annie was so scared she was clinging to the sides and doing deep breaths with a whhoooaaahh!!! whooaaahh!! and screaming!! hehe she is great fun.. We got our faces painted - I got a butterfly, bee her's painted like a fairy/showgirl and Annie got her's as a cat, pink to match her jumper, complete with black kitten nose with a splotch of glitter. So cool.. Ppl kept looking at us like we were strange but then smiling to themselves.. i think secretly they wanted to also but didn't have the guts..   Going to sleep now, on a last note we saw this alpaca yesterday and it was so dead to the world sleeping that it was sitting down but had its head flat on the floor in the hay, conked out.. it looked so funny.. i wish i had taken a snap.. thats what i feel like doing for the next 9 hours..             "
"       Hehe regarding online journals, I was speaking to my cous online last weerk and we were talking about online posting and journalling.. The reason why I thought my site wasn't up to scratch is - there's layers ... outer and inner.. And this is my inner journal, not an outer.. I should have realised by the glib, trendy-ness of that guys journal (who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways) that it was an outer, or 'public' journal as my cousin put it....  and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say, 'hey, cool journal'!??          "
"       *Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.             "
"       Yep, thats right, I'm invited back!! Yahoo!! I have to go back on tuesday, and do a presentation to the line managers. Here's the paragraph from the email:   Congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the Masterfoods Australia/NZ Graduate Recruitment process, which will be held on the week commencing Monday 10th of May.   We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!   In other news, nothing much else is happening, except that I clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station.. I had plannned to go to Bowral to see school friends but that came to an end. Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!! But i'm glad that he's enjoying his work!  Well, better go do some Uni work.. thats right I still have uni work...   BYE!!                 "
"       I got a first round interview with Mars Inc..   Me..   when I got the email I didn't believe it so I printed it out..   When I got to the interview (after a week or two of apprehension) the lady, Narelle, told us that 3900 ppl had applied, and only 510 invited to attend..   So now I am waiting to hear about the second round.. and its killing me softly!!!!!!!!!   ALso, today I met this guy from my class, Jian Du. I have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up. I wondered about him for awhile now.. Eddy and I were at the Unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved, then went inside. After about 2 hours, they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us.  I thought he was from Shanghai but he is from Harbin, even further north, near Russia. Thats so cool, I have never met someone from there. He sais it is very cold.. His name is Jian Du. There was also another person I met today, a guy also , and he is from Penang!! His name is Sze Yen. Small world!!   Tonight has been busy even though I haven't done much, i caught up with Bee, Emma and Seri over the phone.   Got Gmail, and it had my name! Its pretty cool. Think I am going for lunch with Justin tomorrow.   Its mother's day this weekend and I am unsure as to what to get my mum..              "
"       I must keep up with this journal.. thats the whole point of having one, right?

"                 You know, the music teacher at my kid's elementary school is a dear, dear woman, but I question her thinking sometimes.  Yesterday afternoon I spent almost an hour with my wife, two youngest boys, my daughter, my mother-in-law, and probably 100 other kids and family members watching a school music program in a church parking lot, in 90 degree weather, cooking like a steak on the asphalt of the parking lot.  Now, this morning, I'm being aggravated by the sunburn I aquired.  To top it off, I cooked out last night for my father-in-law's birthday and didn't have a chance to shower last night or this morning(okay, I could have showered this morning if I'd pulled my lazy butt out of bed early enough), so I smell like a bar-b-que.  Oh well, I guess it could be worse, I could just stink.             "
"                 Here are the contest particulars... Beginning Monday morning, 5/24, there will be a voucher hidden somewhere in the Clovis area that you need to find and bring to the KKYC studios at 10th and Sycamore to redeem for the pair of Shania Twain tickets.  Beginning Monday morning we'll begin giving clues to the location of the voucher.  At the end of each day I will post the day's clue here.  The person who finds the voucher and brings it to the studio will win a pair of 15th row tickets to Shania Twain June 26th in Lubbock.  Good hunting!!             "
"                 Yes, today is the day advocated in an e-mail making the rounds to boycott and don't buy any gas.  My thought is that only hurts the little guy here in Clovis who owns the stores(okay, maybe not Allsups).  My thought is if you DO plan to not buy gas today as a protest, still stop in the local convenience stores and buy a drink or a bag of chips or something.  Don't punish a store owner that is just as much at the mercy of the supplier as we are, maybe even more so.  What do you think?             "
"                 Hey, got acouple pair of tix to the Merle/Wille show in Roswell July 3rd.  Giving them away this morning.             "
"                 Been a long day, gonna pack it in and head to Casa Daniels.  Maybe I can get more than 4 hours of sleep tonight.  Just found out that there are Van Halen tix still available for the Lubbock show in September, and they're cheaper than I was told they would be.  Maybe I can still get the wife to go, but she said she'd go if I went with her to see Jessica Simpson in Lubbock in July.  Is the trade worth it?  I think so, may be the final chance to see the VH boys.             "

"                 You know, I'm not a fan of the Buffaloes or their head football coach Gary Barnett.  He's a putz on a good day.  At best he's an insensitive jerk, and at worst he knows about and has condoned rape.  He should have been fired for the insensitive comments he made about the rape accusations made by 9 women, and the rape allegations levelled by Katie Hnida, who tried to be a kicker for the Buffaloes, and eventually transfered to UNM and became the first woman to score in a men's Division I football game.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, when told about alegations by Hnida made in a Sports Illustrated article that she had been raped by a teammate while at Colorado, Barnett said, 'Well, she wasn't much of a player anyway'.  Colorado got a blackeye in all this, and then yesterday poked their eye out by reinstating Barnett.  Barnett stayed because he usually wins.  Who wants to bet if the team goes 3-8 or 2-9 this season, Barnett is looking for a new job?  And even sadder, who wants to bet he's not looking long?             "

Was getting ready about 5:35 when the wife called out to me and said Zachary, our almost 2 yeaqr old, was burning up.  He's had to fever induced seizures since last October, and the one in March left him in the hospital for a week, so as you might imagine, the thought of any fever at all kinda freaks us out.  So, I stayed until I was pretty sure he was ok.  We think he was just real hot because he slept all night wrapped up in his favorite goosedown blanket.  Probably not the blanket he needs to use during the hotter part of the year huh?  Search For Shania clue #3 on the way before 10.             "

"                 Oldhippie1, the smell was actually pork chops and hot dogs, but fortunately I got to shower over the weekend.  Speaking of which, weekend was good and busy.  Hosted our annual 'School's Out' party for our kids.  Normally we plan for 40 or 50 and have 2 show up, but this year we invited our church too, and since we're Baptists and there was food, and Baptists really like to eat, we had a full back yard.  Then I spent all of yesterday afternoon trying to set up a swimming pool that is supposed to be ready for water in 30 minutes.  2 Hours later when I started filling it with water, I realized 10 year olds think 'ready for water in 30 minutes' actually means 'ready to swim in in 30 minutes'.  They forget the part about 'takes 8 hours to fill up with water so you can swim'.  I'm just glad my 8 year old was over at her grandparents so I only had to hear it from one impatient child.  'Search For Shania' is officially underway!  Glad I was able to hide the voucher at midnight last night without getting arrested.  Listen through the day today for the first clue.  I'll post the clue each day here on the blog, so you'll be able to get it in cased you miss it oon the air.  I'll actually post it and add it to the list of clues, so each successive post will have every clue so you can see them all together.  Might help you out seeing them all together.

"                 Not long ago I was sitting at a stop light here in town, and a Cadillac Escalade pulled up next to me.  Now, I was sitting in my Ford Expedition, which I consider a pretty kick ass vehicle, even though it's a 97 model, so it's a few years old.  But still, Expeditions are pretty dang nice.  But an Escalade is an Escalade, right?  Anyway, I noticed the back wsindow of the Escalade was dirty, and had some doodlings in the dirt, but even more, some bird had decided to make this Escalade it's personal outhouse.  And it occured to me, no matter your social status, no matter how classy a vehicle you drive, bird's don't care, they will still crap all over it.  Kinda sums up life, if you ask me.  Also have a cocroach in the hallway ooutside the studio door this morning, obviously not feeling too well.  Don't know if heate too much crap or what, but he's on his back and not kicking too much.  I haven't stepped on him yet, though, as much as I'd like too.  No, it's not pity...it's not wanting cockroach guts on the bottom of my shoe.             "
"                 Can you believe it?  If someone had told me we'd hit the 100 degree mark for the first time June 2nd, I would have said, right, sure we will.  But it happened.  At 4 yesterday afternoon, it was 100 at Cannon Air Force Base.  100 degrees!  And it's still 3 weeks til Summer officially begins.  So, hot enough for ya?             "
"                 You ever get up and almost immediately you know it's going to be one of those days?  Welp, today is one of those days.  Hopefully I have things back together and things will return to a semblance of normalcy.  Thanks COurtney for the posts.  The path ih that last clue was kind of a double clue, although it was meant more to mean the walking path.  However, one of the clues for this week was going to be 'Follow the pathway', referring to CCC's old slogan 'Pathway to your future'(which, as an aside, when I first got to Clovis almost 10 years ago and heard for the first time, I thought said 'halfway to your future'...I know, I'm not always too sharp).  Congratulations on winning the tickets, and sorry I didn't get to meet you and your husband in person.  Thanks for listening and playing!             "
"                 Exercise your democratic right and get out and vote!  OK, just because someone found the Shania voucher doesn't mean the blog is closing down.  Oh no!  The blog will continue forward.  It existed before the search, and it will continue long afterward.  And speaking of the search, where was the voucher?  I know you're all dying to know.  Well, it was at Clovis Community College, at the track, taped to the underside of a cement bench at the west end of the track.  I still haven't at this point had the winner come in and claim the tickets, but the business office is justg now opening, so I expect her to arrive any minute.  I'm dying to know which of the 5 very vague(I thought...shows what I know) clues gave it away for her and her husband.  I'll let you know....             "
"                 I can't beleived someone found the voucher already!  I am amazed that someone could find it from those clues.  I would never have thought to look where it was hidden from the 5 clues from last week.  Where was the voucher hidden, you ask?  Well, I'll finally reveal that Tuesday morning on the air after the winner comes by the studio to claim the tickets.   Hope everyone has a safe and happy Memorial Day.  Remember today why we have Memorial Day every year.  Go lay flowers on the grave of a veteran you don't know, and of course on the ones you do.  And say a prayer for all the men and women fighting right now in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And remember, if you're celebrating with a few libations, don't drink and drive.              "
"                 First of all, let me say I am not immune to the pain the family of the woman tragically killed last July 4th in a police pursuit here in Clovis.  That being said, I am curious.  I see in an article in our local 'newspaper' that her family has filed a lawsuit against the city, and the former Clovis police officer involved, for being negligent.  The point I question is not whether they were or were not, because I have no idea.  What I do wonder is why the person who is responsible for the pursuit, the person who crashed into and killed the woman, the person who, if he had not run from the police, would not have caused the death of the woman, why is the family not suing him as well?  Is it because he has no money should they prevail in their lawsuit?  How can he bare no responisibility?  Had he pulled over as he should have when the police officer attempted to stop him, none of this would have happened.  So why is it solely the responsibilty of the city and the former officer?  Again, why is the person who ran not named as well in this lawsuit?  Maybe it's because he doesn't have $750,000, or insurance that is kept for just such an instance as this that will probably eventually settle?  Makes one wonder...             "
"                 You know, I have been here at the radio station for almost 10 years now, and for that entire time the trash can in the kitchen area has been in the same place.  Yesterday, for some unknown reason, they moved it.  Now, I realize this is a small thing, but why did they have to move it?  What was wrong with the space where it has been since I got here?  Was it something mandated by OSHA?  Had it become a hazard where it was?  Or did someone just feel the overwhelming urge to screw with stuff?  Or is this part of the ongoing great conspiracy here to drive Joe crazy?  If that's the case, I ain't got far to go.  Man, glad I don't own an automatic weapon.             "
"                 The Tampa Bay Lightning are the Stanley Cup Champions!  My new favorite team took the cup with a 2-1 win over the Calgary(Alberta, Canada...Lance Storm, anyone?) Flames last night.  Now I really don't have anything personal against the Flames, but the Lightning have been a laughing stock in the NHL for so long I just had to root for them.  Plus, as long as a Canadian team doesn't win the cup, I'm happy.  Hey, it's a friendly rivalry wit da Great White Nort, but it is s a rivalry.

"                 by the weekend passing of the greatest president in our country's recent history.  President Ronald Reagan was a great American, and I am sad to hear of his death.  It seems hard to believe that it had been 10 years since he announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's.  He had been so much out of the public eye that it was easy to forget that, I guess.  I can only think of one thing that I wish Ronnie hadn't done, and that is the deregulation of the broadcast industry.  That has resulted in all the bland, cookie cutter, sucky radio you hear across the country.  Kinda scared me that Ronnie thought a nuclear war was winnable, but you know what?  If Ronnie had been president, Afghanistan would have been nuked, and I'm not sure that would have been a bad thing...             "
"                 Well, on one hand I am glad to see the Supreme Court tell this putz Michael Newdow to go home, but on the other I am disappointed they didn't make a stand and tell him to permanently go away, that 'One nation, under God'  does not violate the seperation of church and state.  I mean, George Washington himself said the blue in our flag represented Heaven.  And where does it say that a person that is an athiest HAS to say that part anyway?  I could come closer to understanding their argument if they were required by law to say it, but they are not.  They're not even required to say the pledge.  But instead, the Supreme Court said he couldn't sue to have that phrase removed on behalf of his daughter because he doesn't have custody of her.  While that is true, why did they take the easy way out and leave the door open for him or some other moron to bring it up again?  One of these days they'll have to rule on it on the basis of seperation of church and state, and I guess all we can do is hope they make the right ruling....             "

"                 If you have logged on here recently looking for some pearls of wisdom, or something remotely enlightening or even mildly humorous, my apologies.  I just have not been feeling the mojo of late.  Been out of sorts for some reason.  I think I'm getting too much sleep.  I know, sounds odd, but I am at the point, after almost 10 years of being here and on the air by 6 am almost everyday, that I seem to function better on about 4 hours of sleep.  And I love to sleep, so that really sucks.  But, see, just now I had a thought that seemed worth putting down on the screen, but it slipped away.  And I can't get it back.  ARGH!  Plus, I can't get rid of this damn phlemg!             "
"                 It never ceases to amaze me how unproductive I can be when I set my mind to it.  I've worked a lot this week, but I still feel like I haven't accomplished a thing.  And now it's the weekend, where you aren't supposed to accomplish anything.  I should be going to visit my parents and brothers in Borger, but don't feel like I can get away this weekend.  Plus, our two youngest aren't feeling well.  Hopefully they are feeling better this morning.  Haven't heard from the better half yet this morning, which should be a good sign.  Hope it means they haven't gotten up and woke her up yet.  So, do 2 year olds normally puzzle out things?  I'm referring to our 2 year old, Mr. Furious, who yesterday for 2 hours tried everything he could think of to circumvent my rule that he not get in our swimming pool as he is too short to not drown without help.  He drug every chair, toys, rock, you name it, to the edge of the above ground pool and tried to climb in.  I'd get rid of one thing, he'd look around until he found something else.  And you could just see the wheels spinning in his little pointed head.  It amazes me.  Plus, I think he's a mutant.  I've never seen a 2 year old that could pick up a 32 inch TV, but if he could get his arms around it, the little turd would lift it up.  The only thing keeping him from doing it is that one fact, his arms are just too short to get around the TV enough for leverage.  He can lift either end with no problem.  Amazing.             "

"                 So the terrorists in Saudi Arabia have beheaded another American.  How do we handle this?  How do we stop this?  For years, I have said the way to stop planes being hijacked was the next time some group of terrorists hijacked a plane, we blow it up.  Yes, that would also kill all the passengers on board, but do you think any more hijackers would be lining up any time soon to hijack a plane?  Not all the terrorists are in such a hurry to go see allah as the ones on 9/11.  So, back to the question of how to handle the current crisis of Americans being kidnapped, and then beheaded when demands aren't met to release captive al-Quida members.  First of all, don't suggest, REQUIRE that all Americans in Saudi leave the country.  Secondly, what we should do THIS MINUTE is take every captive that the terrorists were demaning be released before they beheaded Paul Johnson and behead them.  They are making the rules, maybe it's time we started to play by them.             "
"                 So the price for the life of a 2 week old girl is now 14 years, eh?  If you haven't heard, the individual that crashed his semi into he back of a car near Elida last August, killing the 2 week old daughter of the couple inside, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.  He admitted having been drinking and fled the scene of the accident on foot.  HE KILLED A 2 WEEK OLD GIRL AND HE ONLY GOT 14 YEARS IN PRISON!

"                 Went last night to the midnight premiere of Spider-Man 2.  I have been looking forward to the release ever since I heard the date.  My wife actually accused me of being more excited about the release of the movie than I was about getting married.  Not true, but I was excited and looking forward to it.  Then, as it got closer to midnight, I started to get apprehensive about going to see it.  What if I don't like it?  What if it doesn't live up to the hype?  Sequels are NEVER as good as the first movie.  Well, in this case, it is.  It was worth not getting to bed until nearly 3 and having to be at work at 6.  Doctor Octopus was very cool.  It didn't seem to me that there was as much fight action between Spider-Man and Doc Ock as there was with the Green Goblin in the first one, and I'm not sure if that was an effort to focus more on Peter Parker, or because the Doc Ock special FX were more expensive.  It was cool none the less.  So, who is the villian going to be in the thrid installment, which they have already announced will be made?  Will it be Harry as the new Green Goblin?  Maybe he'll be Hobgoblin.  Or, could it be The Lizard, since they introduced Dr. Connors in this one?  Or perhaps Man-Wolf, John Jameson, the son of J. Jonah Jameson, who stole the show again in his scenes, which thankfully there were more of this time.  Guess we'll have to wait 2 years to find out, as I hear it is a VERY closely guarded secret.  HMMM, maybe they'll use Venom...  On another note, who's running the property formally known as Lucky Dog here?  Is it the city?  I ask because as I was driving in to work this morning at 6, after the good rain we got last night, the sprinklers were on full blast all over the property.  So much for the Stage 1 water restrictions the city and the water company want us to adhere to...             "
"                 Something bothers me about the 14 year old that killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister on Sam Donaldson's ranch near Hondo.  Something other than the fact he killed someone, other than the fact he killed his father.  It bothers me that a 14 year old, abused or not, thinks that is an acceptable way to handle the situation.  Our culture of violence has taught kids it's okay to handle a situation like that in this manner.  And it also bothers me that everyone seems to know the boy was being abused, and either didn't or couldn't do anything about it.  And now they all seem to be of the opinion that it is ok he killed his own father, as well as his stepmother and stepsister, because he was abused.  Does that make it ok to kill your own father?  To kill anyone?  I don't know, but it bothers me that we seem to think automatically that it does.             "
"                 Haven't posted anything in a week, and it's because not much has happened, I guess.  But since I have this blog, I feel the overwhelming need to post SOMETHING, no matter how boring.  Actually, last Friday was pretty exciting.  We had a great day on our rock station selling gas for an hour for only 98 cents.  It was a madhouse, which is exactly what we wanted.  Got a lot of attention, although we didn't get the newspaper coverage we had hoped for.  Oh well, can't have everything.             "
"                 Someone please explain to me how someone can become so far gone as to set their 3 children on fire, along with their mother and themselves?  If you didn't hear, a guy in Seattle poured gas on himself and his ex-girlfriend and their 3 children, ages 6 months, 1 1/2 and 2 1/2, as they were driving down the road.  The car then crashed and he jumped out, on fire, and started firing guns.  He and the kids died at the scene, the woman lived for 8 hours and was able to tell authorites what happened.  She had recently filed assault charges against the man.  I have 4 children, ages 10, 8, 2, and 6 months.   I can't even fathom a situation where I would intentionally do something like that to them.  They are the most important things in my life.  Anyone who tried to harm them I would kill with no hesitation and no remorse.  How could I possibly injure or kill them?  I could never be that far gone.  Or evil.  I realize the Bible says all sin is the same in God's eyes, and hell is as hot for one soul as another, but being human, I can't help but hope their is a little hotter corner of hell for this person, and people like him.  And I pray the children were asleep and never knew what happened, just woke up in Heaven.             "
"                 I'm not even sure where to begin, because nothing of really extreme significance has occured, yet a lot of significant things have happened.  Had my 2 year old's birthday party finally last night, almost a month after his birthday.  We had a party for him on his birthday up at the lake, but this was the big cookout bash birthday party that all the friends and more family got to come to.  It was hot dogs for about 25 people.  And a huge Spider-Man birthday cake.  My wife was leary of getting such a big cake, and then was very glad she talked herself into it.  Had a Spider-Man pinada too, one that was the head and shoulders of Spidey.  The kids didn't so much break it open as they decapitated poor ol' Spidey, and when that happened my son went into hysterics.  Didn't handle seeing his hero decapitated too well.  But after he realized Spider-Man was full of candy, he was better about it.  We also found out that he's now tall enough to stand in our swimming pool and not be below water.  I don't know if that is good or bad.  I say that because on one hand it's good...if he manages to get outside and into the pool by himself(which he is very capable of doing), then he shouldn't drown...the bad thing is it takes away his fear of the pool, which has been the only thing keeping him from climbing into the pool by himself.  If he does that, even though he can stand up and have his head well out of the water, if he slips  and goes under, he might panic only being 2 and not realize all he has to do is stand up.  Sometimes, fear is a good thing.  He has none what so ever.  My 2 year old has a lot of 'Hey, y'all, watch this' in his future, I am afraid.             "
"                 First, starting Monday morning I will begin doing a tried and true radio thang,  called 'Pick It or Flick It'.  You know what I'm talking about, I'm sure.  At 8 every morning I will play a new song that we have not added to our normal song rotation, and give listeners a chance to call in or post a comment on here as to their opinion, should we pick it or flick it,  meaning should we keep playing it or toss it.  Hope you'll participate.    Second, I have noticed a song that has been a pretty big pop and rock hit, the Los Lonely Boys' 'Heaven', is at #18 on the CMT Top 20 Countdown.  And now I have started getting requests for it.  Have you heard the song, and do you think we should play it?  Post a comment on here, or call me at 762-8200.               "
"                 I am so proud of myself...for the second day in a row, my show this morning was completely live!  Now, you say to yourself, 'Self, what does he mean?  I listen to him and he sounds alive, usually.  Occassionally he sounds a bit comatose, but not dead.  So what does he mean by live?'  Well, here comes the dirty little secret part... we have a computer that allows us to record ourselves and plug it into the music, hopefully making it sound like we are here when we are actually not.  We could be on the other side of the globe, for that matter.  Better than almost every other station in the market, though.  Except for one other station in Clovis and Portales, other than our 2 stations(KKYC-FM and KICA-FM), all the stations here are on satellite from either Dallas or Denver AT LEAST 21 hours a day.  Some are on a satellite fed service 24 hours a day.  So we are the exception, and are truly your local hometown stations.  That being typed, however, let me continue to let the cat out of the proverbial bag.  What you hear on our 2 stations after 9 am is usually recorded.  Example, I usually start recording what you hear me say beginning about 8:30 that morning.  Hopefully, you think it sounds like I am really there.  My shift from 4 to 7 every Monday through Friday on KICA-FM(98.3, rock, should you care to tune in) is 99.9% recorded.  I usually 'track it out', as we say in the biz, around 3:30.  But the last 2 mornings, I have felt compelled to do my entire shift from 6 to 10 on KKYC-FM(102.3, country, should you care to tune in) live, without recording a thing.  Almost like the old days of radio, except I didn't have to actually change records or CD's, the computer still played all the music.  But you know what, it was a blast to do the whole thing live.  I think I might start doing it everyday, as long as I don't have something I have to go take care of that necessitates me having to leave the studio or building for an extended period.  God, I miss live radio....               "
"                 Well, I certainly hope you guys missed me, otherwise, why the hell did I come back from vacation?  Went to Conchas Lake and did some fishing for a few days, and caught a whopping 2 perch that could have been twins.  Make that triplets, because my oldest son and my nephew caught the third one right on the surface with our net.  My 2 year old caught his first fish(with some help from dad and his cousin), a baby catfish that, even though it was a baby, outweighed both my perch put together.  And I did have a pretty good sized bass that I at least got to the surface before he spit the hook out, and he went one way and the hook and worm went the other way.  Oh well, had fun and family time, and that is really what it was all about.  And not catching any fish meant I didn't have to clean any fish, which is always a good thing.  Anyway, and this is totally unsolicited, if you ever go to Conchas, I highly recommend you stay at Adobe Lodge.  It used to be housing for the Corps of Engineers when they were building the dam, and now someone has bought it and turned the duplexes into lodges.  Very, very nice.  Very close to the North marina and a great view of the lake.  Check them out.  Two thumbs WAY up!               "

"                 Once again, your old friend Joe Daniels displays his amazing cognitive abilities...All along I have been saying I don't think Kobe Bryant is guilty of rape.  Stupidity, yes.  Felony stupidity.  But rape?  Don't think so.  Why?  First of all, he's KOBE BRYANT!  He has women lined up around the street to do anything he wants anytime he wants anyhow he wants.  He doesn't have to rape someone.  Secondly, everything about this from day one has smacked of the 'victim' filing a civil lawsuit eventually.  Well, guess what, my friends...it came out today that the 'victim' is going to talk to the prosecutor in the case about dropping the charges because she is afraid details about her sex life might keep the trial from being fair.  In other words, it might prejudice the jury AGAINST HER .  And wouldn't that screw up her civil lawsuit which, oh by the way, she said she might file now.  Now before I get strung up for being insensitive, let me say that a woman's sexual history doesn't mean she can't be a victim of rape.  A woman can be raped whether she is a nun or a hooker, and it is no less horrible a crime because of her history.  However, for a woman to allege rape when none occurred is equally apalling.  No matter what the outcome of all this, whether the charges are now dropped, whether it goes to trial and Kobe is acquitted, or it goes to trial and he is convicted, Kobe Bryant will never be the same.  Now, could I be wrong about his guilt?  Of course, but I don't think I am... but if I am, I hope his celebrity does not get him off and I hope he does the max.              "

"       Well, I hate to start off no such a sour note, but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty.  Well, my job (I work as a Quality Assurance Tester) isn't that great, and they've been laying people off left and right at my job. I just found out today that this one guy got the axe a few weeks ago, but was told that his last day will be sometime in OCTOBER!!! Can you imagine being told that you aren't an asset to the corporation but that they want to hold on to you for two more months? I couldn't imagine it myself.   Aside from that everything with my boyfriend and I aren't going that well. He just seems to never really hear me. He's always so defensive and he never wants to be wrong. He can say somethng that he doesn't like about me, but then when I say the littlest negative thing about him he's all defensive and saying 'oh why do you switch it and make me look like i'm the bad person?' Come on give me a break. I've seen him 5 times in the last three weeks, but he see's nothing wrong with that. I mean people that live in different states see there loved one more then I see mines.  And then to add fuel to the fire I found out that I'm the victim of credit card fraud. I can't believe the asshole only left me with $20 on my credit card! Thank God I have others, and thank God I don't have to pay for what I didn't use.  Then my girlfriend, whom I've known since High School, is having a baby so me, and two of her childhood friends along with her brother are throwing her a shower. Well, at least we thought that we were. My girlfriend sent us information about what she would like for her party, but one of the girls is taking matters into her own hands. She replied to my friends message telling her that she need to mention anything because WE have it covered. Then she sends out the so called 'Party Committee' an email, and here are some excerpt from it:  1.) Theme:  'Red. her favorite color and because it's a boy she and I decided the shower has a red theme. She just told me in an email red and white and now she is looking for yellow but since i am in charge of decorations, I fell confident we can stick to our original color theme. Id we have to use an additional color that's cool, no one shohuld break their necks but white on red NOT red on white, which is totally diffferent. '  I mean seriousl, I don't thin that the whole 'Red Theme' is suitable for a baby shower. I agree more with the yellow. There will be kids there as well, so I just think that it should be somethng that would appeal both to adult and children. It is a baby shower for crying out loud.  2.) 'We will have red theme drinks and decoration. no cartoon prints like Blues Clues, Disney, etc. for example, She likes this giraffe that is yellow with red spots (he id not famous, she just seen it somewhere). This baby shower has more of a sophisticated dinner party feel as opposesd to a traditional baby shower feel. We will have red roses as the center pieces instead of one of those baby shower things.   ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A SOPHISTICATED DINNER PARTY, we have to serve the people appetizers on trays. Am i playing servent for the night or what? Can i sit and enjoy the day with my friend? I don't understand why you want a dinner party instead of a baby shower and on top of that there's not DJ! We (the Party Commiteess that is) has to make a mix CD each!  I mean why have a party committee if one person is making all the decisions?  Well, on a better note, i'm sooo excited about this coming weekend. My girlfriends and I are going to Six flags. I haven't been out there since I was about 12, which has been to long.      "

"   'Theft of the Presidency' BBC-TV Newsnight Thursday, February 15, 2001  by Greg Palast  GREG PALAST: Washington, the marine band plays 'Hail to the Chief' for George W Bush, 43rd President of the United States. But in Florida, some are singing 'Hail to the Thief'.  COUNTRY SONG: After hundreds of liesFake alibis  PALAST: We are coming into Tallahassee. We want to know whether George W Bush won the election or did brother Jeb steal it for him? Our investigation suggest the answer lies in this shuttered building and in a very expensive contract between Governor Jeb's division of elections and a private company named DBT, which accidentally wiped off the voter rolls thousands of Democratic voters. 18th floor division of elections, we have come to ask Mr Clayton Roberts, the director, a few questions. Roberts agreed to talk, but became a bit uncomfortable when he learned that we had obtained the secret DBT contract, and asked him if he knew what DBT were up to.  CLAYTON ROBERTS: Florida Director of Elections No, I didn't ask DBT. They do what we contract them to do. We have a statute that says we have to have a private company to do this. We put it out for bid, we put it out for bid, and I think I'm done with this interview.  PALAST: Let me just show you the contract if I could Mr Roberts. It says here in the contract that the verification is supposed to be done by DBT. That you paid them $4 million. It could look to others don't you think that you paid $4 million to purchase this election for the Republican party. 95% wrong on the felon list. Mr. Roberts, could you answer the question regarding the contract... Instead, Mr Roberts called out State troopers. It's interesting here?  STATE TROOPER: Oh, man! Never a dull moment.  PALAST: I don't know why he had to call the police. We hadn't gotten to our difficult questions yet! The difficult questions are: Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black, Democrat voters before the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? The Democrats say the answers to both questions are yes.  COMMISSIONER: In any other country in the world, if this had occurred, there probably would have been riots or military troops throughout the streets.  PARTY CHAIRMAN: Al Gore won the election. He won the popular vote and he won the vote in Florida. I think that that's pretty clear.  VOTER: It wasn't done fairly. They shouldn't allow you to contest an election then give you no way to contest it.  LEGISLATOR: Jeb Bush promised his brother he was going to deliver Florida. I believe the Republicans strategy was at all costs we deliver Florida.  CAMPAIGNER: Were people taken out of polls and stopped from voting? Yes, I think that was not right. I smell a rat!  PALAST: This is Database Technologies. This is the company that the state of Florida hired to remove the names of people who committed serious crimes from the voter lists. I have obtained a document marked 'confidential and trade secret'. It says the company was paid millions of dollars to make telephone calls to verify they got the right names - but they didn't. There is nothing in the state of Florida files that says they made these telephone calls. So the question remains, why did the Republican leaders of this state pay millions for a list that stopped thousands of innocent Democrats from voting? The first list from DBT included 8,000 names from Texas supplied by George Bush's state officials. They said they were all felons, serious criminals barred from voting. As it turns out, almost none were. Local officials raised a ruckus and DBT issued a new list naming 58,000 felons. But the one county which went through the whole expensive process of checking the new list name by name found it was still 95% wrong. Reverend Willie Whiting was one of those removed from voter roles after DBT wrongly labelled him a serious criminal.  REVEREND WILLIE WHITING: I have never spent a night in jail.  PALAST: Were you ever busted?  WHITING: No. I had a speeding ticket probably 25-30 years ago, I guess, but that's about it.  PALAST: Do you think you should be allowed to vote if you had a speeding ticket?  WHITING: Absolutely.  PALAST: The Florida legislature likes to see young prisoners paraded in front of the capital in old cavalry uniforms.  PRISON GUARD: Me and superman had a fight  PRISONERS: Me and superman had a fight  PRISON GUARD: I hit him in the head with some Kryptonite  PRISONERS: I hit him in the head with some Kryptonite  PALAST: More often than not in America, the prisoner's colour is black. Because of the way DBT generated the list, every genuine black felon in the United States could knock out every black voter in Florida with the same surname and similar date of birth. That's why the NAACP is suing Florida for violating voters' civil rights.  LARRY OTTINGER: Lawyer for NAACP Governor Bush, the Secretary of State Katherine Harris, Clayton Roberts, the head of elections, all knew or should have known in advance that certain election policies and practices would disproportionately impact low-income areas, and in particular black citizens and other minority citizens, and that this would disproportionately impact Democratic voters, based on historical voting trends.  AL GORE: Thank you, Florida!  PALAST: Altogether, it looks like this cost the Democrats about 22,000 votes in Florida, which George Bush won by only 537 votes. The US civil rights commission is also on the trail. They called in Bush, Harris and Roberts. Bush did not convince his critics.  UNNAMED MAN: You screwed up this state. You sealed the ballot.  PALAST: Commissioner Edley and his colleagues will be in Miami tomorrow to hear from voters wrongly disqualified.  DR CHRISTOPHER EDLEY: US Civil Rights Commissioner If you are going to do it, by all means as a matter of due process and fairness, it's got to be done with excruciating care. It's a democracy, the vote counts. There is a lot of public concern that the contractor selected is a firm that seems to have ties to the Republican party.  PALAST: They will be putting our evidence to Database Technologies. Their vice-president told us that 'manual verification by telephone calls' does not mean ringing people up to check they have got the right person. So were they paid to produce a list which they knew would name thousands of innocent black people? In fact DBT told Newsnight that Clayton Roberts and the State of Florida: '... wanted there to be more names than were actually verified as being a convicted felon.' So did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? You don't have to be black. In Palm Beach, America's privileged nurse their tans and their anger.  UNNAMED WOMAN: I thought I voted for Al Gore but unfortunately I voted for Pat Buchanan, and I wasn't happy about that, because I am a Jewish voter and he would have been the last person in the world I would have voted for.  PALAST: Whacky butterfly ballots caused thousands in this Democrat town to accidentally mess up and they were refused replacement ballots promised them by state law.  JOANNE CARBONE: From the time the elections started until that awful decision that the Supreme Court made, I came across hundreds of people who made a mistake and I saw over 13,000 complaints filed by people who live in Palm Beach county.  PALAST: In all, Palm Beach voting machines misread 27,000 ballots. Jeb Bush's Secretary of State, Katharine Harris, stopped them counting these votes by hand. She did the same to Gadstone, one of Florida's blackest, poorest and most Democrat counties, where machines failed to count one in eight ballots. Again Harris stopped the hand count. This alone cost Gore another 700 votes, in an election in which Harris declared George Bush winner by only 537 votes.  KATHARINE HARRIS: In accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, I hereby declare Governor George W Bush the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes for the President of the United States.  PALAST: Harris was a busy woman. In charge of Florida's vote count and co-chair of Bush's presidential campaign.  LOIS FRANKEL: Had she really been unbiased? Wouldn't the appropriate actions for her to be to say - let's really get to the bottom of this election and let's make sure every vote is counted.  PALAST: Lois Frankel represents Palm Beach, in the State legislature where she leads the Democratic opposition.  FRANKEL: She wanted George Bush to win. She interpreted every rule, every law in a way to help George Bush.  PALAST: We are driving down to Miami to witness an American ritual. In Britain, you count the votes, then announce the winner. In Florida they declare the winner first and here we are, still counting the votes.  WOMAN'S VOICE: She is showing the ballot in front of the light. They can see the light through where the chads have been punched through. Then she holds it in front because sometimes you can see things in different light. They have a whole column.  PALAST: Normally these are machine-read, right?  UNNAMED WOMAN: Right.  PALAST: They are carefully going through the 179,855 uncounted ballots that Harris did not want tallied. They'll know the winner next month. Sources tell Newsnight that Gore's ahead by 20,000 votes. The Biltmore, grandest hotel in Miami. Democrats are upstairs eating with their richest friends charging $5,000 a plate. Let's see if we can get in. Not far away from the millionaires on the balcony a voter had taken hostages at gun point protesting against the election fraud. But here it is back to champagne politics as usual. One Democrat whispered they would have done the same as Katharine Harris if they had the chance. But another, party chairman, Bob Poe remains bitter about this.  BOB POE: Chairman, Florida Democrats Jeb Bush, Katharine Harris, Clay Roberts did everything they could to stop every legitimate count of the vote. And that's what did us in.  PALAST: All fingers point to the Jeb Bush crew in Tallahassee. Investigators want to breakthrough the iron shutters.  EDLEY: I have to say that thus far we have been disappointed by the explanations, or perhaps I should say the lack of explanation provided by the state officials. When we spoke with the Governor and the Secretary of State and even with the Director of the Bureau of Elections underneath the Secretary of State, they were pointing fingers at everybody else, saying 'look it wasn't our responsibility', they were in charge, which is a disheartening disquieting thing for us to hear - who should be held accountable for what clearly was a system that broke down.  PALAST: State officials point the finger at the counties and say it is their responsibility to check if the names on the list are real felons before disqualifying them. Clayton Roberts says his job is just to pass on the list. Roberts now admits he didn't bother to check with DBT, if innocent people were on it. ROBERTS: Please turn off that camera.  PALAST: Off camera he said: We did not call and say did you check the list again... the whole tenor of this is like OK you screwed up you didn't check with DBT and if you want to hang this on me that's fine. It is certainly fine for George W Bush. Even if investigators conclude that Jeb Bush and the Republicans conspired to steal this election, the man in that house for the next four years will be George W Bush.  "
"   For the Republican lovers ....those uniformed motherf**ker. See the truth, Learn the truth, Start with the link.  urlLink http://www.ericblumrich.com/gta.html     "
"   Boston, MA - On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place; America which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or “blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They are both passed away now. Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride. I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody’s son. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted—or at least, most of the time. This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college. Don’t get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can’t teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. No, people don’t expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. That man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and sacrifice, because they’ve defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he’ll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren’t held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option, but it should never be the first option. A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he’d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he’d enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than 900 service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one’s full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm’s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they’re going, to care for their families while they’re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world. Now let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows it’s not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there’s another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief—I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sisters’ keeper—that makes this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. “E pluribus unum.” Out of many, one. Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America—there’s the United States of America. There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end, that’s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I’m not talking about blind optimism here—the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don’t talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I’m talking about something more substantial. It’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker’s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do—if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you and God bless you.   "

"       Football Fan's!! I went out to dinner with my family tonight. My cousins were in town so me, my mom & dad, my grandmother, & my aunt & uncle went out for Chinese at a great buffet place, & came home went to NFL.com to find out the Tampa Bay BUCS are the NFC Champions. Congrats to the BUCS!!!! I then turned on the Titians Vs. Raiders game to see the Titians were holding there own only down buy 3 point in the 3rd quarter, but the Raiders were the stronger team and prevailed, and the Oakland Raiders are the AFC Champions. Congrats to the Raiders!!!!  Super bowl XXXVII will be a good one!!!!!          "

Either your hormones have taken over your brain or you're feeling deprived in some way, because s-e-x is the first thing that pops into your mind on almost any occasion. This may or may not be a problem, depending on the point to which your fantasizing takes over your mental processes - thinking about getting it on is a vital part of any healthy sex drive, but it can bring trouble when it's too extreme. As long as you are still able to shut off that part of your brain when need be (while working, for example), there's no cause for concern.           "

"         RANT!!!!   -  All this talk about not going back into space is ridiculous. It is a tragic thing that happened on Saturday, but the Astronauts that risked there lives to explore space wouldnt want us to abandon the program because they lost there lives.  Exploring space is like exploring the depths of the ocean. Many have died exploring the ocean, but that doesnt mean we still dont have submarines.   If you ask me the lose of 14 astronauts, and 2 shuttles in a 22 year period isnt that bad of a number, yes its sad 7 astronauts lost there life in 1986 when challenger exploded on lift off, and its just as sad that 7 astronauts lost there life in Columbia on reentry, but those are the risks and the brave men and women that have that opportunity knew that before lift off and during reentry.  my thought are with the families that lost loved ones on Febuary 1, 2003               "

This morning i got in my truck placed the cd in the head unit and all the tracks were popping and hissing. Now here is the part that pissed me off all the mp3's I ripped sound great no popping or hissing. unless it's my burner I think the copy protection is a little backwards, I can rip files to my HD but I can't make a copy of the disc to preserve the life of the intellectual property I paid my hard earned money for.

I finally found a wifi card that works with my laptop, the  urlLink   Netgear MA401   , I had one where i work that we use to get laptops on the internet to do updates and stuff when they don't have a NIC card, a USB port(for a usb nic), an O/B ethernet port, or when we don't have an open cat5 cable to plug the laptop to. So I tried it, & what da you know it worked. So i went to compusa after work and spent more money....being a geek is so expensive.   I am just happy I can use linux on my lappy w/ my wireless network.              "
"       My new iPod!!!!!  I have pondered over it long enough, and since they released itunes for windows, I decided to get the new docking ipod.   unopened    Just out of the box     In it's dock    In the dock next to the 2nd Gen    I will admit i wasn't a big fan of the 3g ipod till i went to the apple store to look around(guys windows shopping), and actually held it, and i then pondered over it and walked in to the apple store Saturday and bought one. Now i just need a case.         "
"        Hell has froze over!!!!    The reason i say this is i did something i thought i would never do, and i bought a DELL. Granted it's a Laptop, but it's still a DELL.  Now i think i got an awsome deal on it, i paid $1000 for a:     Inspiron 5100 2.4Ghz P4 Intel 845G Mobo 256 PC2100 DDR ATI Readon 7500 16MB(on the small side but it's enought) 40GB HD CDRW 15' LCD Windows XP Home(which quickly became Professional)  I have only had it for 3 days now, and it's seem to be solid, hasn't crashed yet The Main reason i bought it was the 1394, & the CDRW.  One thing i saw which i haven't been able to confirm is, i saw it had USB 2.0 which would be awsome since i just bought a new docking ipod and the USB 2.0/Firewire cable for it.  It's biggest test will be in 3 weeks when i travel to VA to vist my brother, i will be on airplanes for a while, so i will need something to do, and from the looks of the spec on this lappy it will beable to handle some of my fav games.  I will let everyone know how this new purchase turns out.          "

"   Well, today is going okay. I have applied for a few jobs, done the bills and balanced the check book. I am currently a house spouse. I think I could get used to this. It's too bad I can't take this on as a full time occupation!  Cocoa, the cat, is in heat and won't shut up! She is normally a recluse but is now very affectionate. The poor thing doesn't feel good at all. the other two cats are nowhere to be found. I gues they are avoiding her. Soon they will be in heat, too.   The back yard needs mowed. I plan to get on that after I get a haircut this afternoon. My hair is so long I can comb it straight back like a gangster. It will feel so much better soon.  Sis called me to let me know the counselors at school think she will be one of the top ten juniors for grades this year. Go sis! The girl works like a demon to maintain grades while swimming and while working. She works harder than most adults. It should be fun to watch her grow up. "
"   This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.    "
"   My son and I are visiting Mom and Dad. I have not been to their house in about a year and am overdue for a visit. It took 13 hours to drive here. Mom had dinner ready when we walked through the door. Spaghetti red, she calls it. It's pasta, hamburger, onion, and tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder. A staple from my childhood.  I came here to tell them about losing my job but find I cannot do it. My brother is still searching for work and I do not want to add to their worries.   Dad's breathing is worse. He and I went to the Walmart today and after walking from the parking lot to the store he had to sit on a bench to catch his breath. He has emphysema. His death looms just over the horizon. All the years of smoking have exacted a terrible toll and he knows it. It tragic to talk with him about the disease.  My son spent most of the day with Mom sorting quarters and filing them in albums. She is trying to get complete sets of the new state quarters for each grandchild. He was thrilled to be helping Gram. She was thrilled too.  We will be here one more day and will return home Friday. I plan to leave early so I can get home and clean the air conditioner that is having trouble keeping up with the Texas heat. The girls are home with all the windows open and the air turned off. Poor things must really be suffering.  It's eleven o'clock at night. I have sorted through e-mail and checked my lottery numbers(dang! Missed again!). I am going to read the news and go to bed. Tomorrow will be another day spent with the folks talking about old stories and old friends. "

"           I'll start off this blog with a brief story about the events that occurred last Monday. Perhaps it was a bit of alcoholism carried-over for the weekend. Or maybe it was the sheer realization of how bad our lives really sucked when we arrived in the office on Monday. It could have been because we both got no ass over the weekend. Whatever the reason, it seemed like a terrific idea that Adam and me go out and get completely shit-housed after work Monday night.  One of Adam's friends met us over at our place and, after having a few beers, decided to head to one of our favorite Denver bars, the Falling Rock. The Falling Rock is amazing. This place has close to 200 beers... on tap. Unfortunately, girls do not find this nearly as cool as we do. The three of us double the population of the bar when we walk in; this includes bar employees. Of course, the only female appears to be in a very deep conversation with whom, while appearing to be a man at first, is actually the second female at the bar. We decide to play pool. A couple of other guys that work at our firm decide to meet up. These guys are cool, but not  that  cool. Tapered jeans come to mind. We play a couple more games of pool and decide that we really need to relocate to a place that might be inhabited by at least a few attractive girls.  On a side note, Monday's in Denver are  not  the ideal night of the week to go out, especially when the colleges are out for the summer. LoDo (Lower Downtown) is a virtual ghost town tonight. We spot a large group of people on the roof at LoDo's (a bar in LoDo; creative, I realize), so we decide to go there. Corporate event. Shit. Crashing comes to mind, but we are still a little too sober to begin acting like complete drunk-asses (poor excuse, I know). Plus, according to Adam's friend who wandered up unknowingly, all the girls were fat. Right as we walk in, I spot a few girls sitting at the bar. The one closest to the door, and the only one I have a good line of sight on, is quite large. This cow is pushing two-bills. I tell Adam that I found his girl for the night (Adam likes fat girls like fat girls like giving head). He tells me to 'fuck off' the way one might respond to any embarrassing, yet completely true accusation. Unfortunately, Fatty and her two friends are literally the only three girls in this bar aside from the corp. types upstairs. We position ourselves at the bar opposite the three girls. To my delight, the one in the middle is HOT. Great looking blonde, nice looking tits, perfect tan. Not your typical Monday night skank. To her right is some Mexican/Spanish looking skank; she is not that attractive. However, these girls are  aggressively  attacking shots. Things are looking up.  For at least twenty minutes, Adam and I banter about how we are going to initiate conversation with these girls. Pathetic, I know. We discuss sending shots, but that is lazy and not the most confident of moves. The Spanish chick heads to the bathroom, and we get a better look at her; despite the ButterFace, this girl has a pretty decent body. Adam's friend decides to take off; the responsible decision considering that all of us have to work early the next morning. This drops the group to four: Adam, TaperedJeans, his Friend, and Me. We decide JagerBombs are a good idea and the only way Adam and I will be drunk enough to successfully approach these girls. After a few more rounds of shots and several good moments of eye contact with the girls across the bar, we decide to play pool. The pool table is perfectly situated to initiate conversation with the girls, so it seems like a pretty good move.  If you go to Miami and you are around the same age as me you know Whitney Ford. Whitney Ford is the girl in the Freshman Faces book who everyone talked about because that picture was so damn hot. Then you meet her in person; a letdown of massive proportions. When I say massive proportions, I mean that literally. Despite a cute face and perfectly normal upper body, this girl had a Star Jones ass. Sir Mix-A-Lot would feed this girl slim-fast. The hot girl I mentioned earlier; she had this disease. While our new position by the pool table gave us better position to initiate conversation, it also gave us front row tickets to the size of these girl’s asses. Adam and I are undeterred. In his words, 'Better to bust a slump before it starts.'  After intentionally losing to TaperedJeans and his friend, Adam and I head to the bar to order a round of shots and to initiate conversation with the two fatties and ButterFace. The girls are taking shots at the same time, so we are in. Turns out that it is Fatty2's (hot face, fat ass) 21st birthday, which explains the aggressive shot taking but in no way explains how this girl packed it on at such a tender age. It turns out that she is Fatty1's sister; so the lower-body obesity must run in the family. We continue to talk, typical bullshit. Adam is funny, but the sort of funny that will throw girls off until they get to know him just a little better. My overwhelming normality plays well off of this. Our A game is on. We are Tiger on Sunday in a major before he fired Butch. Sure, these girls are sub-par and that is certainly helping increase our confidence and their receptiveness to us, but these girls are into us. As it turns out, Fatty2 has a boyfriend and the shots are really starting to get to her. Even if she wanted to, this girl would not be capable of hooking up tonight. No matter, Adam has moved on to Fatty1 and ButterFace and I have struck up a conversation. ButterFace sucks. She keeps saying shit to our clearly not Spanish-speaking bartender in Spanish. I say, 'Hey, he's not fucking Mexican... speak English esse.' She thinks I am an asshole. I think she's ugly. Somehow she now likes me more.  ButterFace is really starting to bore me, so I walk over to Adam to check on him and Fatty1. When we first starting talking to these girls, Fatty1 wasn’t drinking because, as Fatty2’s older sister, she was going to stay sober for her sister’s 21st birthday. She is now slamming beers at Adam’s urging. I am proud. Adam’s game is apparently working very well on this girl; she is in love with him. They have been talking for twenty minutes and he could probably do anything he wants with this girl. Fat girls are great. This girl probably hasn’t been hit on by anything not missing teeth in the past two years, maybe ever, and she clearly loves it. In all fairness Fatty1 is most definitely fat, but her face is really not that bad. It’s the kind of face, that if put on a girl with a slamming body she would probably be about a 7.5 on a sober ten-point rating scale. Adam is making me tell you that part.  In my absence, some hillbilly in a Broncos jersey has approached Fatty2 and ButterFace. He is mostly there to hit on Fatty2, who is barely conscious at this point, and ButterFace, the bitch that she is, is trying to prevent this hilarity. For some reason, ButterFace starts passing notes on cocktail napkins to Fatty2 to let her know, in her extremely drunken state, that BroncosJersey is not desirable. Some samples. “I think he is missing teeth.” “He is wearing a football jersey in a bar during the off-season.” Because of this, I begin to think that ButterFace is slightly cool. Things begin to get interesting when BroncosJersey actually picks up one of the napkins and reads it. I am now getting pretty drunk and unfortunately, I cannot remember what was said on the note that he picked up, but I am sure that it was not filled with compliments. Conventional wisdom might say that BroncosJersey should be upset after reading some not-so-nice things about himself. Conventional wisdom apparently does not apply to those who would wear a jersey to a bar in the off-season. He takes this as a cue to begin hitting on ButterFace. In his defense, Fatty2 is now completely passed out on the bar and there weren’t a lot of options to work with in this place.  ButterFace is clearly not interested in this guy, yet he continues to hit on her and she appears to be enjoying the free comedy-show. I make the occasional thinly-veiled sarcastic remark, such as, “I like that Broncos jersey; I’d be wearing my Bengals jersey if I wasn’t in enemy territory” or “Clinton Portis sucked anyway.” (Side note: While most people now agree that the Portis/Bailey trade was a good one for Denver, this was not and still remains an unpopular move in Denver.) Eventually, BroncosJersey gave up and the group started talking about what to do after the bar.  Adam and I were presented with a problem. Each of us could obviously hook up with our respective girls, but there was the issue of drunken Fatty2. Fatty1 was not too excited about bringing her sister back to our place to pass out on our couch. We were drunk, determined, and horny. Problem unsolved, we leave the bar as a group. These girls are from a suburb about a half-hour away, so their car is parked, conveniently, on the walk back to our apartment complex. We were still presented with the problem of Fatty2, but the girls seemed convinced – they wanted to party. We explain how she can sleep comfortably on our couch and how, because the place is only a block from where they are parked, it will be easy for them to find in the morning. This seems perfectly logical to me. Apparently additional body-fat impairs the decision-making process. As we are approaching Fatty1 and Fatty2’s car, Fatty1 actually decides that her sister, Fatty2, is better off passing out in her car, in a strange parking lot in the middle of an urban area, than coming to our apartment to pass out. After locking Fatty2 in the car, we start walking to our apartment. Fatty1, the sober monitor and watchful protector of her little sister at the beginning of the night, had just locked her passed-out sister in a car in the middle of downtown Denver so that she could go and get her fat fucking ass laid. Despite how drunk I am, I realize that this is not a good idea, but I say nothing, because it serves my purposes and now ButterFace is free to come and hang out (hook-up) as well.  Once we get in our apartment, I realize that it has been at least ten-minutes since I had any alcohol, so I head immediately to the kitchen to grab a beer. After asking if anyone wants one and not receiving a response, I crack a Coors Light. Upon exiting the kitchen, I see Adam attacking Fatty1’s face. Watching this is hilarious. If only I had a camera to document how big this fucking girl was. ButterFace and I have a laugh over this for a minute and I then tell her how, “We should give them some privacy and go to my room.” Smooth Eric.  Of course, we start making out. I spill my beer because she literally attacked me. However, this did not upset me. I start to make some moves; she doesn’t oblige. This also does not upset me. We make out for what seemed like forever not progressing to anything better. Ok, so that part kind of pissed me off. Then, out of nowhere, she practically bites my fucking lip off. She was attempting to do that kind of playful bite that is a fairly commonplace move when making out. She didn’t get the memo. My lip is not a fucking steak there for her culinary enjoyment. Of course, I yell out in pain, “You fucking bit me bitch, that shit fucking hurts!”  “Oh, you don’t like it?”  “No, not really sweetheart.”  “Ok, I’ll stop.”  Making out commences. One one-thousand, Two one-thousand, 3…, 4…, 5… “FUCKING SHIT!” ButterFace just tried to bite my lip off again. Combined with the frustration of this hook-up not progressing like I am used to and the fact that I may have just lost part of my lower lip, I am furious. I tell her to stop and I keep making out with her thinking that at this point, maybe, I might be able to get a hate-fuck out of this. Five seconds later she clamps down again and I’ve had enough. Fuming mad, sexually frustrated, yet still somehow composed I exit my room followed by ButterFace. Fatty and Adam are on the couch. He hasn’t made it that far either. Her clothes are still on. This makes me feel a little better for some reason. At some point, Fatty2 is brought up and the girls decide that it’s time to go.  Despite how it may seem, we are still somewhat gentlemen and politely walk the girls to their car. Apparently the extra fat makes one stupid as well. Fatty1, instead of holding on to the car keys herself, decided that it would be better to leave them in the  locked  car with her passed-out sister. This is a disaster for them – a fucking laugh-riot for Adam and me. Honestly, at this point my memory is a little hazy. Adam later filled me in that they were eventually able to wake Fatty2 and get in the car. We stumble back to our place, with strangely mixed-emotions. We were happy that we didn’t follow though with those fucking circus-animals, yet a little disappointed that we couldn’t seal the deal.  Coincidentally, TaperedJeans and his friend ended up playing pool with some moderately attractive girls while we were hitting on the circus-animals, and taking them home. That’s what we get for intentionally losing to them. What the fuck.           "

"           Valuable advice:   'That is goal obsession, which is a subset of wanting to win too much. It rears its ugly head in many ways. In its broadest form, it's the force at play when we get so wrapped up in achieving our goal that we do it at the expense of a larger mission.'   urlLink Fast Company Goal 1 Mission 0   Solution:  'The solution is simple, but not easy. You have to step back, take a breath, and look around. Survey the conditions that are making you obsessed with the wrong goals. Time and deadline pressures come with being a leader. We confront them every minute of every day. They do not go away. Which makes it all the more important to reflect upon our work, match it up against the life we want to live, and consider, 'What am I doing?' and 'Why am I doing this?' Ask yourself, 'Am I achieving a task and forgetting my organization's mission? Am I making money to support my family -- and forgetting the family that I am trying to support?''            "

"             Well here we go.. My mind is full and ready to burst. Let's just say I'm having one of those days where I wonder if I've made the right choices in my life, my once marriage, divorce (the choices that went along with it) AND EVERYTHING SINCE THEN. My life has been a whirlwind... for everything that has happened it's all be a choice , a reaction or done in defense. At 35, a mother of 3 kids, ( 13, 11 & 10 ) in a serious relationship ( I think ) and still feeling the weight of past relationships. I guess I carry things to close to heart and ALWAYS over analize. Why do we do the things that we do?? Creatures of nature they say... or just scared and grasping, I say. Afraid of being alone and afriad of making the tough choices. Do we always opt for the easy way out? I really wonder sometimes. Nothing is ever easy in life.... it hasn't been for me. If I wanted a scape goat I could blame my upbringing... but I don't and won't. I survived and think  ..THINK I came out of it ok. I guess reflection is a self cleansing thing...  I guess. I wonder if I'm steering my childern in the right direction...I see my self and the choices I made in them all the time. I sit here , with a banging headache, sore from working out and feeling very empty at the moment. So needy I can be , wanting to be loved and wanting attention,but then to be left alone to do my thing... what ever that is. Screwed in the head maybe... or is this normal you tell me.........Please.         "
"             Sitting in the dark with only my computer keeping me company.  Music to soothe my soul , making the time fly by I take a deep breath trying to clear my mind... What lies a head of me is endless..Every day is the same  What a routine we live in Cooking , cleaning trying to keep everyone happy Oh what we moms do for love Waiting for the thank yous and the hugs  Smiles and kisses keep us going It's the little things that count... We rant and rave sometimes.. trying to be heard. Mostly out of frustration. Tired are we that run the house. Feeling unappreciated and part of the furniture What a grand life we lead.          "
"             Lost in a sea of ever changing emotion the dark sky looming in my fear of loneliness all but drowned by mistrust and no devotion swept away by the bleeding heart , crushed and broken What's to save me...  An Island of warmth and security? a lovers arm wrapped around me? Those would be ideal, but lost I am  Until the sun breaks through once again  And the passion of it's Love frees me.          "

I am right beside you I am not a ghost , I do exsist ...can you not see my clinched fist? Should I yell or scream..or should I cry Your power struggle will leave you behind.

"             Word's of true wisdom ( see previous entry ) Feeling like shit lately.. the only time I feel good is when we're playing racquet ball and I can sweat every bad thing out of my body. Work is stressful and tense.. Another big change and people scared for their jobs. Me? Yes and no.. I don't wna to lose my job , but if I have no choice and I get laid off... well then I guess I make the best of it. I am excited to go back to Heritage. It's likre going home.. closer to my kids and my old stompin' grounds. The weather sucks too.. finally a weekend with no plans. maybe some nice quiet time at home with my love. Maybe take in a movie. That would be nice.. Financial stress had been getting the best of us.. with the bi-weekly pay  now in full swing, making sure our bills our paid, food in the freezer and gas and his support paid.... there is nothing left. I think we are finally getting the hang of it. Vacation is soon .. 4 weeks... I can't wait. Sun , sand and Shane & I. Who knows what  we'll be coming home too... work wise that is.. The BIG move is July , the first or second week. Who knows who will be moving and who won't...... Too many changes. To find something else.. may be a task all in itself. Pay cut comes to mind.. starting over.... Not a good idea. Maybe I'll just hang out and see what happens. I've had 2 nights with out all kinds of extra running... the kids schedules are wearing me down. I love watching them play ball... Proud momma for sure.  A true balance is the goal of my happiness.... how to get there is the question at hand.   Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity  To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment  Would you capture it or just let it slip?   Good question..........................till we meet again. May the dark wings embrace you and give you the security of it's love.         "

"              Mindi's Sun Sign is Pisces ...          Romantic Pisces, you are the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac. You are regarded as the sign of sensitivity and receptivity, and are a true chameleon by being mutable and infinitely complex. Your keywords are communion and vision, and you have the capacity to go beyond this world to the one of dreams and the spirit.  Your ruler Neptune, the planet of confusion and chaos, gets people out of habits that imprison them so that they question themselves and can discover another path toward growth and spirituality. Neptune is also the planet of imagination and illusion, and governs the dream world with all its many facets.  Pisces is the third of the three water signs, Mindi, which means that you are concerned with the realm of emotion and feeling. You deal with sensitivity, intuition, and deeper psychic aspects of life. You are able to conduct unconscious telepathic communication with others.  Your sign rules the twelfth house of the chart, the sector associated with the unconscious, need for seclusion, and places of restriction. This house describes the wellspring of your being, including psychological problems that you repress. This house is very healing and can promote personal and spiritual growth, once you make the effort to go deeper and face YOUR reality.  Pisces is a mutable sign. You adapt to the exigencies of life and ingeniously melt into circumstances like a chameleon. In your interaction with others, you are personable and compassionate, and successfully connect on a deep emotional level.  Your strengths, Mindi, lie in your altruistic and empathetic nature, because you feel the urge to help people less fortunate than you. Your sensitivity and intuition make you a true healer. Your strong imagination and highly evolved creativity predispose you to artistic expression.  Your main weaknesses are that you can be weak-willed, passive, and indecisive. Many times, you prefer to escape reality and indulge in your dreamworld. Chaos and confusion can be present in you, which may frustrate your circle of friends. At the same time, you can be oversensitive and fragile, feeling victimized by others.                   Your Rising Sign is Aries ...         As an Aries Rising, Mindi, you face the world with intense energy and primal power. You always look to go beyond your own limits and outdo yourself with every step. With each challenge, you learn more about yourself, and gain additional confidence to go even farther on your next adventure. Your incredible decisiveness enables you to act on your ideas the minute you form them. You don't have time to waste! You are very competitive and have a strong urge to excel in whatever you do, and you continually prove your power through action.  The downside is that you can be quite impulsive, Mindi, and often make decisions too hastily for your own good. Once you've made a decision, it's difficult for you to go back and reconsider, because you only know how to move in one direction in life, and that is straight ahead.  It's no easy task to make someone like you back down. This irreversible strength you have inside allows you to thrive in some of the most powerful and influential positions in the business world, the ones in which the important decisions are made. If you have stopped climbing, it's probably because you've already reached the top. It's as simple as that!  Since you are extremely ambitious and outgoing, Mindi, you don't quail at social climbing in order to make your dreams come true. Once in a while, you may even inadvertently step on some people who get in your way, as the ideal you quest for can blind you to the effect of your actions on others. However, Mindi, you don't hesitate to recognize and reward those people who have helped you on your way up, because you are an honest and fair player.             "

"           Trying to get a list together and hopefully get at least some mild timeframes for Matt's last party as a free man (excepting of course the night before his fune..err, wedding).  Last conversations put the approximate date of the gathering near March 12th or March 19th. The two major venues I heard mention are Las Vegas and New Orleans. I'm mostly inclined to go with a majority view, but please be aware that not everyone who 'gets a voice' has access to this forum.  My personal vote - for both financial and lazy reasons - is New Orleans. With a good crowd, it's hard to beat the French Quarter and Uptown for drinks and tomfoolery.  Assuming we could get people to land in New Orleans at close to the same times (or a couple of times), I'm not opposed to providing transportation for the weekend.   I know golf courses and paintball facilities within 45 minutes of New Orleans.  Live music is everywhere.  I'm sure I can speak with a few friends to find the right gentleman's establishments for poor little engaged Matt.  Anyway, Vegas is also an option, I just have to do more research for it.

The amusing part comes from the amount spent on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (or 'The FERC', which sounds more appropriately ominous).  Any guesses as to how much money the DOE gives to FERC?  The answer: 0.  That's right.  DOE gives roughly $8 billion dollars to weapons research, and zip to the guys who have (arguably) the most influence on how much power costs in your home, and how to prevent things like blackouts.  This is why FERC can only hire starting engineers at  urlLink $38000 , whereas the national average starting salary for electrical engineers is around  urlLink $50000  (it's the 3rd most lucrative degree available).

"                 Well...  I hate to say it, but life is getting back to normal.  This is not to say that I have forgotten, but life must go on.  We need to repair.  And I am doing this by trying to get some finances in order.  We all know, the best way to deal with things you can't controll is deal with those things that you can.  And we all know, I suck at finances.  But Microsoft Money is my new best friend.  I just stare at it.  There must be a law agains having hours of fun looking at different pictoral representation of the same information... my debt. but it makes me happy.  It's sad...  I'm such a loser right now.  The highlight of my day is entering my credit card purchases, and itemizing my paycheck.  Damn I need a boyfriend.  Well, maybe later, now it's money for me.  I mean... a boyfriend doesn't graph my expected net worth over the next decade... a boyfriend doesn't figure out how much of my Amex payment goes to principle...  a boyfriend doesn't keep you warm at night... wait... nevermind.  Maybe I just need to hook up with a cute accountant.  So also on this weeks agenda was the acquisition of a certain CD.  Ben Folds' new album came out last tuesday and I didn't feel it was responsible of me to go buy it when the country was in turmoil (actually I plum forgot, but now I didn't).  It rocks.  I love that boy and his wacky narrative lyrics.  One of the songs (seen below) makes me so excited for when I'll feel those things he talks about.  It kicks my ovaries into overdrive... wait... nevermind.  Damn! I need a man!  THE LUCKIEST  I don't get many things right the first time.  In fact I get told that a lot.

"                 How do we move on now?  How do we live?  We must endure, and we know we will… but how?  I believe that the majority of us feel that some sort of war is eminent.  Maybe so, but where does that leave us civilians?  How do we support our country in our greatest capacity.  I work in a part (albeit small, but vital) of defense.  But being such a new member to this group, am I better suited for a military position?  I spoke with a friend of mine and she shuttered at the idea, although understanding my reasons…. I mean how could you not.  Our beautiful country is hurting, and she needs help.  I only hope that I will step up and help her in the most productive facility in my power.    So I have pondered whether the Army corp. of engineers is the place where I could do the most good in backing our great nation.  I am not the most physically adept person, but I consider myself fairly intelligent, and resilient.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not running out tomorrow to enlist, but I am considering it, not as a career, but rather as an aide to America in its time of need.  How could I not?  When children are afraid of visiting grandparents, and grown men are afraid of what’s around the corner, action needs to be taken, and, as we’ve been told, it will be.    I only hope that they’ll take me…  I won’t deny my sexuality, but I do wish to help my country.  I’m sure many homosexual Americans agree with me in saying that we are hurting just as much as the rest of America (contrary to what Falwell’s recent interview on the 700 club may have referenced).  Obviously the future weeks will shed some light on this.      I attended a candle lighting vigil tonight at the Lincoln Memorial, and it was breathtaking.  To see all those people grieving was incredible.  To see thousands with candles is powerful enough, but to see them with our Nation’s capitol and most beloved memorials as their backdrop was immaculate.  It was inspiring to say the least, drawing upon those long since dormant feelings of patriotism that we put in drawers for days marked on the calendar marked with stars…  Well every day is marked with a star; it just took a little pointing to notice them…     Well, the stars are out tonight.               "
"                 Humor is my primary tool for dealing with various circumstances, but it seems that humor fails me in response to today's events.  I, as all Americans, feel saddened and enraged, but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither I nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents.  I have lived, or in the case of northern Virginia: still live, in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged, and continue to have ties with their residents.  Thankfully my loved ones are accounted for; I grieve for those who are not.  Perhaps the most frightening thing about the occurrence as a whole is the horrific beauty in its execution and efficacy.  The poetic nature of the elements of the attacks chills me.  Today’s date, 911, already a pop culture siren of fright will ring more poignant in subsequent years.  While use of United and American vessels as tools of destruction will forever seem oxymoronic, for to me they will always mean peace and love.  Throughout the course of today I choked back tears mulling over how our dearest value, freedom, was literally and metaphorically removed when air travel ceased, and as Americans our wings were clipped.  It is times like now, and during tragedies such as this when I deplore my lack of faith…  But then I realize that I have faith, not in a higher power, but in my country, and in the nature of its occupants, my fellow Americans.  Faith that I AM living free and just, no matter what transpires.  Faith that, as an entity, our reaction will be swift: and faith that it will be just.  I gain comfort in the fact that we shall endure, and await the time when humor returns as my staple coping mechanism, but until then I just don’t feel like laughing. My love to all of you…  If tears could only repair the damage…              "
"                 Warning: If you know me and are friends with Erica, this is nothing new. (This is something I wrote for my friend Erica's site.  But that was before I had one of my own...  Ehh, shuttup I'm starved for material.)  Do you ever come up with something out of the blue... find it funny... and then analyze the crap outta how your brain made that connection? Well, I do... All the time. Okay I'll lay it out for you.  I have a problem with money... well, it has a problem with me. I mean it hates me. Soon after I make friends with the dead presidents, they file for divorce and go live with another, semmingly more fiscally responsible chap. And the main source of our irreconcilable differences resides on the street. See, I have this car... a nice bloke (Sargent Hughes is his name)... but he's about 2 or 3 times what I can actually afford. I catch a lot of flak from people about this. Maybe I deserve it, but I just joke it off.   So when people ask me if Mommy and Daddy hooked me up with the aforementioned cherry ride, I respond with, 'No, it was an impulse buy... I went in for milk and came out with a TT and a Chunky.' They quickly get a perplexed look in their eyes and laugh nervously.  But, the point of all this is the strange neural connection. Impulse buy and Chunky. So I got to thinking. Why don't people ever run to the store to buy a Chunky. Every once in a while you'll get an 'I need a pack of Cinnaburst,' or the occasional, 'Can we stop for Kit-Kats,' even those 1-1/2 calorie Tic-Tacs get representaion. So, why is it that the Chunky falls into the role of the red-headed step-child of the confection world. I mean, if you smell it does it not engulf you in a chocolatey euphoria? What do Milky Way and Snickers have that poor Chunky does not? Perhaps it's the name? Would more people go out of their way for a 'Svelty' or a 'Scrawny' bar? Maybe it's fear of that age old proverb 'you are what you eat.' In this age of perpetual dieting maybe there's no room for such sweet morsals. God Damn you, Dr. Atkins!  So next time you're in the express checkout lane behind some jackass who put both shitake and portabello mushrooms in the same produce bag in order to bypass that ever-so-strict '10 items or less' rule, look over at the Chunky but don't buy it. Instead, go home and write it on next week's grocery list in big block letters... I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. That square 2-by-2 package is cooler than the other side of the pillow. Just some food for thought... Or is it a marketing scheme? *cashes check for next car payment* PS... Does anyone even know what Chunky tastes like? I never had one of those MF bars. At least I know what my next pity purchase is.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Put down that Krackle and pick up a Crunch bar you Commie swine!  My previous foray into the politics of candy bars has led me to another of the industry's most heated debates. Krackle: Hershey's answer to Nestle's ever-so-successful Crunch bar, or Red propaganda aimed at American youth culture?  I heard at a party once that Krackle was the most popular candy bar in the Soviet Union when it made its debut in 1978. (Actually, I think I heard it from me, I was in the Mr. Knowsomestuff stage of intoxication, but since then, too many coincidences have augmented my concern) I don't mean to get all Joe McCarthy on your ass, but all I'm saying is 'if it looks like a duck... and talks like a duck... it must be a commie.'  Here's a little history lesson on the subject of the beautiful merger of milk chocolate an puffed rice. Nestle (the premeire confectionist of perhaps the most historically neutral country on the planet, Switzerland) introduced it's Crunch bar in 1938. Since then this texturial fusion of silky brown and bumpy white (sounds like a personal problem to me -e) has taken the bar candy industry by storm.   September 14th, 1978... Hershey shocks the nation with their new treat. The timing here is key. The subversive Reds would have observed a new generation. A guardless generation to which the 'Red Scare' of the 50s was nothing but a beddy-time story, and indulgences such as Disco and the Hula-Hoop were waning in popularity, making way for new guilty pleasures. The success of this bar was nothing remarkable to say the least, due to the late entry into the market. Krackle could not overcome the brand loyalty that 'Crunch-ers' (as they prefer to be called) have developed over decades. But did they care? No.  Since its inception, Krackle has cornered two niche markets that target American youth. The first of these is Holloween miniatures. What better way to distribute propagnda. The genius of this plan not only is exhibited by its success, but also in the lack of the public's understanding of their role in the spread of communism in North America. It's as if the Archbishop of New York was distributing fliers for 1/2 price beer night at a Chelsea gay bar, while filled with a sense of warmth that he brought happiness to the public. The second market that Krackle leads the way in is the coveted puffed-rice-and-chocolate-grammar-school-sales-contest market. Need I say more? Now, let's talk packaging... Upon first look, the red wrapper with white type may not seem too objectionable, but it provides for the strongest of all arguments on the subject. It's a little known fact that the original design for the wrapper had the word 'Krackle' in yellow, but this was thought to be too obviously likened to the Soviet flag. The broken text of the word is in itself extremely anti-establishment. Coupling this fact with the blatent disregard for the arduous process of teaching youngsters to recognize the hard as well as the soft uses of the letter 'C,' rather acclimating them to the Cyrillic alphabet's lack of the aforementioned consonant's versatility, exhibits the coldness of their plan.  Even with all this convincing evidence, Hershey spokespersons continually refute these allegations and deny the existence of the scrapped 'Workers of the world. Eat Krackle' advertising campaign. So, do with this information what you wish, but keep your eyes and ears pealed, for Halloween is just around the corner.             "
"                 ...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say 'It's a good thing.' Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, 'I always new I was different.' Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's 'The Grind,' (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.

"                 I had a lot of fun this weekend.  On saturday a coupla friends and I went to a DC101 (radio station in our nation's capitol) holloween party.  It was pretty cool, we didn't dress up or anything, but we all wore leather pants... I mean there's really no occasion otherwhen in the year to encase yourself in treated and dyed animal flesh, so you gotta take the opportunity when it arises.  Anywho, It was fun and I got trashed... naturally.  But I was Ferris Beulering everything.  I few hours into the party we were on the dance floor and some guy was carrying chicken to the VIP room.  I made and 'ooh, ooh' noise and pointed... so he stopped came back and let me swipe a piece.  I don't know who that kind soul was, but I was never the same after that moment...    ...And then I thought things couldn't get better, I had just scored some comp-fowl and there was a disco band that was really kickin'.  I was wrong.  I go up to the band to try to request some Jackson five (a Jender and T-$$ staple when dancing), but struck out 'No Motown he says... Try the DJ he says.'  Well it was a big neg from the DJ too (actually I think he said yes, but I didn't hear it, 'cause... well you'll see why).  So I'm  on my way back to my friends when I see Giligan trying to get into the VIP room, and the bouncer stopped him.  Meanwhile I look all official coming from the DJ booth and everything, so I call out 'No, that's Giligan let him in.'  In the wake of my thrall the bouncer bends to my desire... then I just walk in.  Now I've already had 5 beers at this point and there was free shit in VIP, bad combo for the T-ster.  So I try to contact Jender via cellular technology, but nothin', thankfully they came in a little later when the bouncer stepped away for a pee break.  Meanwhile I'm sitting around with all these radio people, and I see Giligan and he's like 'Dude, you got me in.'  and I'm like 'Go me!'      So I end up talking to Diane from the Elliot in the Morning Show for like and hour.  It must really suck to be them, 'cause they live hours of their lives in the public eye, and it must be taxing how everyone they talk to thinks they're like bestest frinds 'cause they ease the morning commute.  But back to me I down like 5 more beers, and Travis is kicked.  So I pile up a plate of wings and we head for the Metro.    Now this is where I forget everything.  I remember vaguely getting on the metro and making a fool of myself while I was on it.  I was told that I was telling everyone to get off ''cause Swank was too sexy.' Thank god for Nordstroms 'cause I strapped the handles of a shopping bag on my ears like a feed bag and yakked all the way from Vienna back to Jender's.    All in all I had a blast, until sunday morning.  but all y'all know what that's like. Late...             "

'Cause I can make anything sound bad like if I get - 'You're going to come into a large sum of money,' I'll translate it to 'You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and the only thing that will have sex with you will be cold hard cash.'

"                 Hungover at coaster kingdom.    So I got trashed this past friday at my friend's.  It was monster night.  We watched old monster movies and carved pumpkins.  I forgot my pumpkin, but I'll get it tomorrow.  Anyway it doesn't matter it looked like Marv Albert.  Jender's was kick-ass though.  Solely because of the mouth.  which was my Idea. (just saving face 'cause even the cute dimple on mine couldn't salvage the gourd as a whole)    Anyway the next day She and I, and a new friend Swank went to Six Flags in MD.  It was a lot of fun, and a beautiful day.  But I wanted to hurl the whole time.  We were in line for the Batwing, right, and Swank was all 'I don't wanna go on.. hear the people screaming?'  So Jender was like 'They're just happy,' and I was all 'They're screaming for Charo.'  It was really funny, at least to me in my diminshed brain cells state.  So after dropping a Jackson at random games around the park I won back to back roll-a-balls and acquired a stuffed Aligator named Charo (coincidence... there are two things I don't believe in... Coincidence and Gay Republicans).  Come to find out Charo is actually a transvestite and his real name is Ken Adams, how's that for twilight zoniness?

(and by loved ones I mean my car)  So deoderant was not as necessary.  I just marvel at the poetic nature of the snafu.  But now I'm fresh and smelling nicely...  So take comfort in that.

"                 Why can't the desire to fuck be transitive?    I was pondering this on the shitter...  oops crapper... today.  Since there is a mirror right there.  I was looking at my new highlights... and I quite like them now that I've showered.  I'm mean one of the benefits of being gay is that I'm my own demographic.  I was like:    If I came up to me and hit on me I would be receptive.  Therefore it goes to reason that I would hit on me.  (I think I achieved fourth person there)    So lets take a for instance... Mike Greybeal (grrrr...  he's this dude that was on undressed for a few episodes, a major beauty on the hot scale)...  So on a given day, lets say Tuesday, I'd have sex with him.  Now if we couple this with the above, 'I'd have sex with me,' then geometry would dictate that he would have sex with me.    But then I got to thinking; you throw in a girl who has bisexual tendencies who is attracted to me, then I'd have to want to have sex with her... and this just throws a wrench in the whole rigmoroll.  So I have tucked the 'Transitive-Fuck' theory in a drawer with my other thwarted thoughts like: 'I deserve to be wealthier than the crocodile hunter,' and 'with all the Grape-Nuts in the world why is there still hunger?'    Well bye now.    PS.  I had this weird dream last night, and I'm pissed that I can't remember the Haiku that was in it... 'cause it made me laugh... well as much as a sleeping person can laugh.             "
"                 I haven't put anything new up here in a while.  Soory.  I was watching TV last week, and I hit rock bottom.  FOX showed the ever-so-enthralling 'Who Wants to be a Princess?' It sucked...  and I was stupider for having watched it.  Well, there was one good part.  When they were modeling and it showed their likes and dislikes... Everyone's dislikes were like: 'Mean People,' 'Ignorant People,' 'Dishonesty,' but this one girl's was 'Moth Ball's and Hyper Dogs.'  I wanted to jump in the screen give her a big smooch and hand her the crown.  I mean how real...  I laughed for like 10 minutes solid.  But then I saw the prince, and I was like 'I'm glad she didn't win... what a troll.  I'd rather hop on Benjamin the results giver,' or as his resume would say 'Special Liaison to the Judges.'  So that's it... I think my funny went on vacay...  Maybe it's the highlights.  DAMN YOU SALAZAR!!!             "
"                 I am sooooo tired today.    I mean add to the fact that I'm sick, I got like 5 hours of sleep.  Which for me is like none. I'm a sleep lover.  If sleep had the right equipment I'd sleep with it daily.  Well I guess bed thoughts kinda supplanted sex thoughts today though, maybe I am getting better.  eeeehhh... no... bad thoughts continue, but now they're all taking place in bed, whereas before they were everywhere... ya know locker rooms, prisons, atop the Seattle space needle, the usual.    The embassy was fun.  Jender and I just basically shot the shit all night, and made fun of (or more rarely complimented) all the attendees.  One woman was the undeniable reason that agoraphobia was created.  The beer lady was a trip though... she was funnnny with a capitol fun.  I liked her glasses.  Oh yeah and I got the play the didjeridu, which was an experience.    well I'm off to feign interest in my work as I contemplate my hopeful christmas gift of 600 thread count egyptian cotton sheets.  Betty so better be on the ball with that.  I mean have you ever heard of such a thing.  they are the bomb, and not just like the cherry bomb or the smart bomb, they are the H-bomb.  My sister already got hers, and I'm green with envy... or maybe that's nausea.    late...(can my goddamn nose just stop running!!!)             "
"                 E-gad!!!    It's been forever since I updated this chippy.  I'm sorry I'm quite delusional right now.  I'm sick, and kinda run down.  I'm just sitting here at work waiting for my tea to steep so I can down a coupla dayquil.  But the thing that sucks (for me... well if I don't stay home) is when I'm sick all I can think about is sex.  I'm not sure if any of you suffer the same byproduct of sickness, if you do, let me know so I don't feel like such a perv.  So it makes work that much harder, so to speak.  I sign out of yahoo mail and I see that eDiets guy and I'm gone... an hour later we're living in a townhouse with two puppies and a cockatoo (his, not mine, I tried to convince him that damn bird wasn't worth it, but he's one stubborn fag).  And so it goes... all day.  It's not so much of a one track mind, but more of a one station mind where all tracks meet.  AND to top it all off I didn't win Powerball last night... These are the things I have to deal with, I mean how much can one person take?  I'm like two seconds from writing the Lottery commission and saying 'hey... If I don't start winning I'm gonna stop playing.  How do you like them apples?'  Look at me the little sicky weilding the iron fist.  I mean how else are you gonna get results?  A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.    well off to whatever...  Austrailian Embassy tonight... I hope I fell better and don't puke on any diplomats.             "
"                 Who am I????    I hooked up with some kid last night.  I think it was all about making myself feel better.  I just returned to my alma mader and I'm all feeling old and shit.  But I hope to have a fun fun weekend, I just hope butter buns doesn't give me too much flak.  God I've never done that sorta thing while other people were in the room, visiting from outta town.  that's so skanky.  That's it I'm officially a skank.  I'm off to eat some really good chinese.             "
"                 I think I angered my Brother-in-law yesterday...    Ok, my bad totally, my room is getting a bit messy.  Well, up until last night, when I cleaned... majorly.    So my sister called this morning and was like 'Thanks, it looks great.'  and I'm like 'huh?' great, I just cleaned my room.  It's not like I made a chess set carved out of white potatos and sweet potatos that have been fried, so that as you win you can eat french-fried bishops and rooks and pawns.    It's not like I did that... I just cleaned my room.             "
"                 I drank like two pots of coffee this morning.  Consequently I thought I was going to puke so I went home after lunch.  Ironically I felt better once I got home, what a kick.    So I popped over to Pier 1 'cause there was this blanket I wanted to get, and over to Suncoast to get a cheesy homo pic.  I never thought a movie could be this bad, but enjoyable.  I mean once you get throught the horrible story, vomit inducing acting, choppy editing, and sickening soundtrack... it bit, but the lead was HOT, so all is forgiven.  I'm such a sucker for a pretty boy.    Well off to nap my half day away.             "
"                 So here's the latest cookie talk... it's like you need a decoder ring to understand it... or you can be like me and excel at piss-poor english.    Wish you a good health!    I don't even know where to begin... at least it's not bad.  Of all the fortune cookies I've ever read this is by far the most recent.             "
"                 I'm bored at work.  I don't know why offices that don't have constant turnover (like stores, or factories) have to be open.  I think I'm totally not comming in tomorrow.  There's like nobody here.    So I made some changes to my template.  I like it better, I robbed some code from e, 'cause I've become HTML ignant.  But I can't find this freaking roll of film that I want to use as pictures.  I'm pissed.  But whatev.  I guess I'll just have to take some more.    God I have no funny stories.  I'm dull today.  My sister was telling me that yesterday she was riding the elevator with one of the partners of her firm.  This guy's like 50 and a partner in one of DC's largest law firms.  He was talking to her about the weather, and she was saying how it would probably not snow.  So he was like:    Partner: 'Do you ski?' Sister: 'I used to, but now I just really like sledding.'    As if it wasn't enough that my sister's barely knee high to a puppy and looks about 12, now her favorite pastimes include sledding.  Last night she was kicking herself.    Fel-lator             "
"                 This is a dream I had last week:    It was a nice day at the races.  Dog? no, Horse? no, groundhog? yes.  So it was the finals of the national groundhog races and the favorite, ButterBuns, was up against the underdog, Nicky.  I wanted Nicky to win 'cause I had a nickel on him.    There was a little confusion 'cause Nicky wasn't high in the polling system, but he had won all his matches, so a challenge was extended on ButterBuns' behalf, but the Judges ruled in favor of Nicky.  BB was dressed in a Bumble bee outfit complete with fuzzy antenae.  An obvious crowd favorite to Nicky's black jersey.    And they're off!!!  ButterBuns took an early lead at 50m, but Nickey pulled it out in the last leg.  So I took my 5 g's to the victory party and got completely smashed.  It was a good day.  Even Punxatawney Phil came out, but stardom has really gotten to him, and he's been hitting the H a little too hard.  So he just sits around and waits for February when the spotlight is on him.  That prognasticating fuck, he's nothing more than a glorified coin toss.    Calc-u-lator             "
"                 Well I'm back at work.  Fuck all you who aren't.  I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend.  I did.    Holiday traditions are weird.  I don't know why.  Okay I come from a Catholic family, but I'm an Atheist, so I constantly have a battle of what i should do.  What is the least disrepectful to my family, and what is the least disrespectful to their religion.  I simply choose to abstain from most of it.  I go to Christmas eve mass, but I don't participate.  I basically just sit there and look around, usually checking out boys, but then I check myself 'cause that's not the place.  But then there's grace, and all the family talking about how nice the service was.  And I'm like 'ehh.'  It's painful.    But then we go to my cousins to eat.  This is my dad's side of the family, very Slovak.  It's fun, but 'Holy Supper' as it is called, is very shiny.  I don't know if you know about Slovakian food, but it's all cabbage, potato, and lots and lots of butter.  Every year we sit down to a meal of saurkraut soup, boiled potatos, perogies, cabbage and noodles, kielbasa and kraut, etc.  Lard basically.  But I love it.  Then Christmas day is when we get turkey and other American things.    I scored some pretty good gifts this year.  Got the Sapranos 1 & 2, sheets (only 440, but ehh, I can't stay mad at my mom), Dr. Zhivago, Rogue Leader, two pairs of shoes, a Gamecube case, and some other stuff.  Damn I'm spoiled.  I'm like 22 and I still get lots of gifts.    I talked to my Grandfather this weekend on the phone for like 20 minutes.  It was strange, I've never talked to him for more than 5 minutes, and even then it would be about computers.  But this time it was about everything.  Apparently he has a girlfriend.  Well that just pulls my cork (I don't know what it means, but my Nanny said it this weekend, she so funny, she's 85 and quite a firecracker), I can't believe my 78 year old grandfather can get a girlfriend, and I am boyless.  But anyway, he asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I'm like 'ehhh, no.'  It's not like I think that he wouldn't approve or anything, I just don't feel it's necessary to tell all the old people until ya know I'm in a relationship that last longer than a week... erm... end.  I was psyched though, I got off the phone with him and I turn to my brother and I'm like 'I'm his favorite.'    My brother was really funny this weekend though, we got drunk yesterday and apparently he wants to be on Saturday Night Live.  I'm not sure if he's up for it, but I think we come from some pretty funny stock.  We talked until like 3 in the morning.  It was fun.  I get to meet his girlfriend when I'm in NYC for New Years.  I'm psyched.    Then before I hopped in my car to return to the Nation's Cap we went over to my mom's side, very Italian.  But the ass grabbin' didn't last that long I had to get on the road.    God I'm boring today.  Recounting my holiday isn't much fun for y'ins.    In the words of my baby cousin: 'I don't wike tickows'             "
"                 This is not so much of a now epiphany, but a remmberance of epiphanies past:    When I was like 4 or something my parents, like many warm, giving Americans got sucked in my Sally Struthers and Save the Children.  So we sponsored this little girl, her name was Pinky.  (Which coincidentally became the name of my first goldfish, making my porn name Pinky Washington.  With a name like that I'd have to do porn as a tranni)  So for the longest time, which was probably like a few months I thought that Pinky was actually my sister, and I couldn't figure out why she didn't live with us.  I was such a 'ron of a tyke.    Also for a while I thought that the term 'rents' (as in 'I'm living with the rents') was in reference to the fact that you should be paying rent, not a shortened version of parents.  For a smart guy I'm so dumb.    Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Oh what a delicious dish!    (I hate fish and chips, but that just poped into my head, for no reason.  I'm drinking coffee for peeper's sake)             "
"                 So I had sushi for lunch today and I was thinking.  I gotta find a new thing to eat, 'cause sushi (although quite satisfying without the clogged pore/enlarging thighs feeling of a BigMac) is so last year.  It's somewhere between '5 minutes ago' and 'out' on the Shaw Report.  I mean as far as food fads go it's pretty good, but when are we gonna have another bad-for-you food fad.  Why can't  Ben and Jerry's  come back into style?..  Well without all the hemp accessories and plaid.    In addition, I believe I may have ended my boycott of artificial sweeteners.  I'm drinking a Diet Coke (oops, I corrected it, but that 'coke' was originally a bad word... or rather a great word).  Finally I feel like I am actually comming into my own as a gay man.  I mean who among the human race enjoys men, and drinks exclusively straight up soda.  I mean only heteros like sugar in the can.  We prefer (a)sper(ta)m(e).    Anyway, I'm just a big goof today.    Venti-lator             "
"                 Well I hope everybody is having a good Happy Stacey Day.  It's a day we invented 'cause my sister finished her last final (3rd year law school) last night.  Her name is Traci, but I call her Stacey sometimes...  'cause I have a bad memory.    I had my first Krispy Kreme doughnut today.  I can't believe I've been a KK virgin for 22 years.  It was awesome.  There's about a dozen more in the break room, but I don't want anymore, I think I'd be ruined for life, not to mention this afternoon.  Last night I forgot to eat, so I'm betting some time around 11 It'll be go time, and the more greasy the food is I eat the less pleasant the experience will be.    Tomorrow I head back to CT, the land of commuters and bad beaches.  But hell I love it.  I can't wait to see all my friends.  Then it's back here on tuesday, and back to manhattan on friday only to come back here the following tuesday.  I'm just a ping pong ball and the Delaware Memorial Bridge is my net.    Well a Happy Happy Stacey Day to you all.    Perco-lator             "
"                 My new favorite thing to do is pull up at a light next to a car, turn up really loud music, like System of a Down, or Linkin Park, and make like I'm dancing to Shiney Happy People.  People look at you so strangely.             "
"                 Okay so I got to thinking you all know about my thoughts and my life, but what about my subconscious?  So I decided to start this new segment call... (cue dramatic music)    NAME THAT CHILDHOOD TRAUMA!!!    It's about dreams, and if you have theories on what my dreams are about let me know.    Okay so last night I had this dream that I was at a Naval Academy graduation, not as a graduate but as a spectator.  So I come up into the stands but I'm on the wrong side.  (sidebar: I also had an ability to jump really high)  So I whip out 2 umbrellas, one of which is inside out and pointed down, and I jump really high and drift slowly towards the other side of the bleachers.  It took about 4 jumps and every time I landed on a soon-to-be alumn I realize that they're all people I knew from high school.  So I finally get to where my family is and the Admiral who is giving the key note speech said 'GOOD JOB!!!'  Then the whole stadium erupted in applause.    I have no idea either...             "
"                 I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying 'Show us your twins.'  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.             "
"                 So for lunch today a coworker and I went to the mall 'cause he had to get a present for his little cousin.  While there and walking down the aisle I hear a punk kid (when did I turn 65?) say 'Hey there goes the faggots.'  I look around to see who he was referring to, come to find out he was talking about some uniformed military personnel.  I was a little peeved, I mean c'mon.  Especially with all the crap going on, show some respect.  Not to mention his use of the f word, I mean when my friends say it to me it's kinda funny, 'cause I know that they love me, but saying it in public.  Okay that's enough moral outrage, that's not really what this site is supposed to be about.    Well anyway I bought the new 311 CD, 'cause I like 2 songs.  I have got to stop doing this.  I mean, I just got the System of a Down CD too, and I only knew 1 song.  But whatever, I think the 311 dude has a really sexy voice, so I'll probably enjoy the rest of it.    I think I mainly pick my music 'cause I like the guy's voice.  I mean I rarely listen to female vocalists, sometimes, but not nearly as much as the fellas.  Is that wrong?  I ask you.  I mean it doesn't have to be rip your clothes off sexy, even just cute sexy.  Here's my CD changer line up right now:    1: Mix with Dave Matthews, Disturbed, etc (soon to be 311) 2: Pete Yorn 3: Gorillaz 4: Incubus 5: Linkin Park 5: System of a Down    I mean and look at my past favs:    Metallica Travis Coldplay REM Ben Folds Alice in Chains Soundgarden Tool The Beatles Limp Bizkit Michael Jackson Supergrass Billy Joel Finger 11 ...    Not a hoo-ha in the bunch.  Do I have a problem?  Maybe, but whatever... Shut up.             "
"                 So Atlantic city this weekend was a lot of fun.  Although I did only spend (or waste) what I had allotted I still come away more affluently challenged than last week.  But I think it was worth it.  On the trip up Jender was a worthy companion:    (While driving through Baltimore) Jender: Look at the cruise ship! Me: Uhhh, honey... That's the Coast Guard    With conversations like that the trip was quite entertaining.  It was a little chilly though walking from the hotel to and from Ceasar's, my balls were brick-ass frozen.  And along the Miss America walk of (f/sh)ame watching Jender do the 'elbow-elbow-wrist-wrist-wrist' wave was a hoot.    But back at the Sheraton bar we had a blast.  Broke and busted we whipped out the plastic and charged up a tab.  The two bartenders were hot (one with and one without a peeper) and a lot of fun.  And the live entertainment was at a perfect volume, loud enough for you to be able to sing without bothering anyone, but quiet enough for you to converse.  Throughout the night Jender was requesting (aka screaming) 'Mr. Big, Mr. Big!!!'  But it never came, but there was some good Journey, Billy Joel, etc.  I was all 'ugn scht, ugn ahh,' during Allentown.  14 drinks and a hot-as-hell order of chicken fingers later we ended the night.    The drive back was eventful.  I caught holy hell when, BOTH of us I might add, missed the exit for the turnpike, so we ended up in Philly.    J: Should we turn around T: Um I think we can pick up 95 in Philly J: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: Hey we both missed the exit and we both drove here, but I know 95 goes to Philly so I'm pretty sure we can pick it up J: PRETTY SURE, WE'RE LOST YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: YES I DO, THERE'S PHILLY, if we don't hit 95, we can turn around J: JUST 'CAUSE WE CAN SEE PHILLY DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: CALM DOWN J: DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, WE'RE LOST (Lo and Behold we come up on 95) T: See we're okay. J: (laughing) We fight like a married couple.    So we made it home actually faster than if we didn't go through PA, 'cause we didn't hit any stop lights.  All in all, a successful road trip.             "
"                 Dear readers I brought my car in for service today.  I think the guy was a little peeved that it's like 7k past due.  He got the 'mommy/daddy bought that for you ya brat and you can't take care of it' look on his face.  Meanwhile I'm scrimping and saving to make the payments (shuttup).  And I'm like 'Um...and...um...I got a dent...and if you get a chance could you check it out...um...'  I'm so not forcefull.  I have no power.  I can't remember the last time I had any power.  And I'm not talking sexual power, or conversational power, 'cause I've had that, I'm talking social status power.  Oooh, ooh, I remember:    Picture it, Connecticut 1989.  My brother's team just won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA and I'm feeling a little unattended, if you will.  So as I enter the fifth grade I obtain the most coveted position an elementary school student could have:  Bus Patrol.  [CUE EERIE MUSIC]  Not only did I get the fashonably blinding orange belt/Miss america sash, but I got a badge.  Okay I don't know about your neck of the woods but in our precinct the badges worked like this:    No Trim: Patrol  Red trim: Sergeant (Walkers) Green trim: Lieutenant (1 per bus) Blue trim: Captain (2 per school)    So me and one of my friends (who was my grade nemesis to my parents, but I could give too shits about grades, I haven't come too far) were the Captains.  Captain Horton and I ran the monthly meetings.  In addition I had carte blanche for 20 minutes a day 'cause I was the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon.  And at any time I could boss people around or even...  SIT IN THE BACK!!!  It was like the holy grail to single digit peeps.  I loved it in the rear (I definitly haven't come too far).  But as a fair an impartial emperor, I joke I mean captain, I joke I mean RULER! I invoked the Magna Carta of Bus #13 agreements (okay Lietunant Cohen helped draft it, I couldn't spell well, damn I'm like the same person as I was 12 years ago, just with better fashion sense, and without the two inch lenses warping my NOSE FOREVER... I'm bitter).  This agreement was an organized schedule that placed the 6 patrols in pairs (A, B, and C) on a weekly rotating schedule for sitting in the front, middle and REAR.  This way if any of the yungsters had problems a patrol would be within 4 seats and also a patrol would always be in the emergency exit row.    So as my brother was getting free trips to Yankee Stadium, Shea and Fenway I was taking my anger out on 4th graders.  Especially that kid, something Weiner, he was such a cock.    Oh to weild that sort of power again...             "
"                 Okay I'm starting a new recurring entry type today.  It's called Epiphany.  It's for when I discover that I've been stupid for years thinking one thing when it's completely false.    Here's a warmer: I Never knew that there was no such word as 'reoccurring'.  I tried using it in my earlier entry and checked my spelling and lo and behold, not there.  I'm sure e is like 'Finally, that fucking moron makes my ears bleed every time he says it.'  Yeah I know how you are.    And here's the real one: Okay, just a few days ago I realized that on the Monopoly board those are not ghosts in the Community Chest, they're bags of money.  I always thought they were demented little ghosts with their beedy little eyes.  Now it makes sense, I've always preferred Chance, and every time I'd pick up a CC card I'd be filled with a strange fear. check it out a see if you can see how my fucked up brain Rorschached  this .

"                 I think I have a tapeworm... again!  I'm freaking hungry from the word go.  So I have moved into my antiparasitic mode.  Smoke, starve, etc.  anything to get rid of it.  (I'm actually kidding here I don't actually think it's true)  So water only for my uninvited cohibitant.    Last night I had a dream that I was at a concert and my baby got hit.  Sgt. Hughes was all banged up, I was quite distraught.  I never actually got to see the Moody Blues.  That's a recurring dream for me.  Going to a concert and not making it out of the parking lot for one reason or another, but it's usually 'cause of drinking, drugs (which I don't even use), or other debauched activities.  I wonder why.  At least it's not teeth falling out, I hear that's about anxiety, and it only makes me more anxious.    So I bought Pikmin for GameCube yesterday.  It's actually a lot of fun, but kinda involved.  Those little guys are kinda cute, and the little space man is awww-dorable.  We'll see how it pans out.    I hope AC goes well.  I think I'm gonna buy a powerball ticket too.  I read that it was my golden month, so I'm hoping I can score big.  Actually e read it to me.  It was in some summer issue in Jane.  But it did say I'd get a job in August (which I did), and get some lovin' in October (well my skank activity was in November, but I'm a late Libra), so maybe.  Or maybe it means that I'm finally gonna buy ABBA Gold (that's what Jender and I are gonna listen to on the way to Sodom... I mean Atlantic City).  Well either way I'm happy.    Tonight is the finale of The Amazing Race, and it has been a trip, let me tell you.  It seems like such a cool show to be on, even if you lose you at least get to go to some cool places and do some cool shit.  I don't know who I want to win though.  Team Guido is way back (thank god, they give homos a bad name).  So it's between Rob and Brennan (the hot lawyers), and Frank and Margarita (the separated couple),  I think my vote is for F&M 'cause it looks like they may be able to patch things up and there's a kid involed in that relationship.  I just hope those crazy kids can work it out.  Well it would help if Frank would stop being abusive, which, to his merit, he seems to have turned it around lately.  But now that Kevin and Drew are outta it I don't care too much, those guys were a laugh riot.    I'm hungry, or rather my flatworm cohort is, but I think I'm gonna stall him until 1.  Sorry for the randomness of this entry.             "
"                 So did you watch 24 last night?  WOW.  That show rocks.  This is what my life has been boiled down to.  Doesn't it suck.  No really, I'm just kidding.  I think I'm just getting my interholiday bumms.  It happens every year.    Well I'm really looking forward to AC this weekend (that's Atlantic City to the laymen [mmmm...lay-men, yes sir.  Sorry]).  I'm planning on winning about 50-grand...  I mean give or take.    Ooh, ooh, I was thinking this the other day, I'm always so positive when gambling.  I'm all like I'm gonna win powerball, I'm gonna rock at roulette, Ed McMahon already has my number, that eDiets guy shops at my grocery store and we're gonna get it on.  Ya know stuff like that.  And then I get stuck with people comming up to me after asking how it turned out, well low and behold I'm empty handed.  So not only were my dreams dashed but fuckin' people rub it in.  One of these days I'm tellin' ya, I'm gonna win and nobody's gonna believe me.  I know what you're thinking: 'loser.'  Well how 'bout I pop off one of your antennas and throw it across the yard.  Then who's the loser, you or me?    But anyway I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to stick to my 'I have this much to play with and I can't lose any more.'  'cause I think I'm highly susceptible to the fever.              "
"                 So I was peeing in the urinal yesterday when it hit me.  I prefer street shopping in the winter.    Why you ask?  Well here's my reason.  In the winter when you street shop the natural light is dim, making for highly reflective glare free store windows.  And we all know about the expansive and contractatory (I made up that word right?) properties of glass.  So when the inside tempurature is warmer than the outside temperature it makes the inner plane of the window slightly larger than the outer plane, thus creating a slightly concave surface.  This makes you look thin and beautiful.  Generally panes of glass are taller than they are wide, if you are walking past a store where the pane is wider than it is tall, look away, it will only make you look short.  Conversely in the summer you look fat.  This is a variation on the hall of mirrors attraction at amusement parks.  Be forwarned that this is not always the case as some new windows are installed more snug than others to allow for settling and foundation frost heaving.    I know what you're thinking, 'Damn that was a long pee.'  Well your right, I think I drink too much coffee in the morning.    So then I shook it twice ('cause any more and I'd be playing with it), and went back to my desk.              "
"                 So I think I'm getting stupid...  and it sucks.    Some time last week I was on the phone in the back yard smoking, when I finished my cigarette I proceeded to come inside.  The sliding door was open so I just walked in...walked in is right...right into the screen door.  My brother-in-law still busts on me for that.    A few days later I take another way home right, to avoid traffic.  So I'm driving down the street (in the opposite direction from what I usually do) and I notice that there are a lot of cars parked.  So I pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someone's having a party.  Parallel park effortlessly, it was great.  Then I get out and approach the door, finally it dawns on me.  'Where's the huge mound and trees?'  I was about a block short of my house, so I stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk, finally I decide to move it.  So I walk up to the door, put the key in, and guess what... it doesn't turn.  I got all embarrassed and pissed, then I realized that I just didn't put it in far enough, so I went inside defeated.    On a completely different topic I was watching Trading Spaces with my sister this weekend and Vern was painting a room red, the walls and the ceiling, and my sister and I got to talking:    Traci: Vern likes Red. Me: Vern really likes Red. Traci: Red is Vern's favorite color. Me: Vern loves Red. Traci: Vern really loves Red. Me: Vern's gonna marry Red.    I really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so I thought I'd share.               "
"                 Okay it's been a while since I've put some of these up, but I was waiting for some good ones.    Well first off when I was in Pitt like ages ago (if you recall this was the skank day) I went out to eat with a coupla friends.  And strangly enough we all got the same fortune:    Prejudice is the child of ignorance.    At least it wasn't bad, and kinda informative.  Also the Pitt delt me this one:    What makes an Apple fall to the ground?    Well I'm no physisist, but this doesn't strike me as the brain buster it's portrayed as.  Finally this weekend I got what experts believe is the best fortune ever:    You are almost there.    Shortly after reading this I DID in fact arrive at a destination.  WOW, isn't that creapy!!!             "
"                 So I was going to write today about how I'm getting stupid, but that's gonna have to wait 'cause I am a GENIUS.    I'm sitting in work trying to figure out something to do and I get some coffee.  It tastes really bitter and strong.  So I'm like 'I wish someone could combine the manly bean flavor of coffee with the smooth leaf flavor of tea.'  Well someone can.  So I steeped tea in already strong coffee.  The bitterness was removed.  I can't decide whether to call it Coffeete or Teaffee.    I'm telling ya this thing is like the closest thing you can get to opium (yeah whatever like I'd know).  I'm so high on caffiene right now.  SHUT UP LITTLE LEPRECHAUN MAN I'M TRYING TO TYPE!    Anywho, I emplore you all to give it a whirl, but only if you don't have to drive for at least 6 hours.  I think it's gonna be the trademark drink at 'The Daily Grind'.    Oh shit...gotta run...comming down...    UPDATE:    Okay nevermind.  DON'T TRY THIS.  There is no way I'd get FDA approval.  I almost puked a little while ago, and my heart is beating at an unprecedented rate.  I need a valium.  These DTs suck.  I'm through with Teafee, I'm glad I got that monkey off my back... On an unrelated note I'm looking forward to a weekend of drinking and debauchery.             "
"                 Okay so I was walking in Georgetown this past weekend and I was thinking.  I should open a coffee house... I'd call it 'The Daily Grind.'  Get it?  I think it's cute in a quarky way.  Once I get that inexhaustible source of income I'm set.  Then you all can take a break from your daily grind and stop in for some coffee.  I wouldn't be there though 'cause I'd have so much money I wouldn't be friends with the likes of you anymore.    Well, here's to wishing I'll never see your ugly mug anymore!!    Just kiddind... Ta-ta             "
"                 Someone remind me never to drink tea in the afternoon.  Especially when it's useasonably warm outside.  God it's like I'm having hot flashes...  Oh shit... maybe it's menopause.  Great like I need to have another reason I'm not going to have kids.  Like keeping my cell phone in my pocket near my buddies and smoking aren't enough reason.  Not to mention the fact that all ovum are banned from sexual encounters involving me.    Well back to my desk.  It's cooler in that corner of the room anyway.             "
"                 So I really need to do something about how this looks huh?  Well I'm lazy.  So screw you!  But anyway, I haven't put anything up here in like a week.  I can't think of anytrhing funny to write about.    Well yesterday bit...(commence bitch) I had a swift 2 hour commute in the morning - BLAHHHH!!  Some 18 wheeler bottomed out...  It was like someone took the two ends of it and snapped it, like a popoid (remember popoids, I used to make popoid cars and pilot them with my weebles).  So that was a pain in my tushie.  Then my evening drive to Tysons to meet Jender for a lovely dinner (Thai) was trafficky too.  And there was an accident on the way home from the mall.  I completed the beltway in one day yesterday and it only took 4 hours in the car ARGHH!  But I think it was worth it, 'cause when we were in the Gap I was like 'I like those jeans,' and Jender was like 'I like that Mannequin's ass,' I about lost it.    Well I think that's it.  Later.             "
"                 So I'm thinking (this just means passing thought, not definite) of getting a nose job.  I snore okay.  I would like to fix that... well that and I hate my nose like huge-time.  I surfed for a bit to see how much it'd set me back, and they only run like 3 grand.  Maybe next year.  I just don't know how to explain the time off, or the different nose to people at work.  Am I incredibly vain?  Well of course.  Aren't we all. What do you think?  I mean I don't really think it'd be a waste of money, say I'm gonna live for like at least 40 more years, that's just pennies a day. (wait lets calculate: 3000/(40*365.25) = $0.21) It's totally fiscally responsible.             "
"                 Pull up a chair and mainline the ginko it's time for last night's dream:    I'm at home with my sis and her husband about to watch a movie, so we dim the lights.  All of a sudden the wind seems to pick up and a tree flys by the window.  I'm like 'Look that tree has many trunks.' And then the wind began to switch the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch.  So we high tailed it outta there and headed for the beach, which as we all know is the only safe place during times of hurricane.  I dimly recall how I saw in a movie that if there's a hurricane and you're on the beach head south since hurricane's travel north.  But since we were on the west coast it was reversed.  To get a better view of the situation my mother (um, hi mom, when did you get here) suggested that we ride the ferris wheel.  From that vantage point we could see what remained of our house and the fact that the winds had died down.  So we two step it back to the neighborhood hoping there's something left...    On the way we run into my sister's friend, she and her husband were okay, but it seemed that the 'cane had swallowed up their dog Josh (which is sad 'cause I love Josh, he's like the only dog I've really liked.  I told Jender that I liked dogs with people names and she's like 'what like Margerie,' and I'm like 'I said dogs not bridge partners.').  So I'm totally bumbed out by this Josh is gone thing, so I go out with some high school friends...    We running-man up to the top of a really tall building.  I'm like 'Hey my house got blown up by that 'cane.'  And they're like 'really.'  I was pissed that they didn't care more.  Then my friend Steph is like 'look at this ad I saw in the Catholic Journal.'  And it's a guy with his hand on a balcony pulling himself up.  It's like a anti-suicide ad, and the caption said 'When you're holdin' Your golden.'  It was like even when you've jumped it's not too late to grab onto anything.  It went on to say that it's okay, all you need is a good grasp, because then the hair products you use will get cought by the wind and carry the  majority  of your weight to saftey.  Unfortunately our hair product booted us over the edge.  As we fell we grabbed onto the 1st floor balcony and were saved.  I was still upset from the apathy of my friends so I was like 'I'm going for ice cream'...    I get the the ice cream counter and the cute attendant slips my a dark chocolate scoop for free.  Then this girl Amber sits next to me and I proceed to hit on her and successfully pick her up, which is funny 'cause I don't like chocolate ice cream.  She didn't get what she wanted either so she complained.  Wackyness ensued and we get chased outta there by this b(i/u)tch woman.  We end up switching ice creams, it was sickenly sweet a spectacle.  How hetero...    We go to see a movie and back to her place for some drinks, meanwhile I'm like 'what time is it.' She's like '6 why?' I'm like 'I was supposed to catch some gay porn on VH1 at 11, but I guess I missed it.'  After a few drinks she start kickin' it into high gear, and I'm feeling all experimental and I'm like as long as my pants stay on I'm not straight.  (I don't get the reasoning either)  So I was all about pleasing her and did some things I will not go into, not because they're graphic, but because I don't want to remember that. ever.  Regaurdless I was all about pleasing her, which is weird 'cause I'm selfish in bed (hehe).  So she was happy...    The next day I go to work as a waiter in this upscale bar.  As I'm waiting the tables I see Amber and she calls me over to where her friends are.  It turns out that she's kinda a professional woman.  Not like a ho, but rather a girl who hangs out with hot guys who have money so they don't have to buy anything.  She turns to her friend, Shoe, another golddigger (what the hell kinda name is that), and is like 'This guy knows how to treat a woman,' Shoe: 'He's that good.' Amber: 'Def.'  So Amber goes to town on Shoe while Shoe is licking my eyelid, which I don't know if it feels this good in real life ('lick my eyelid' is not really in my pillow-talk repertoire) but I was likin' it big time...    I bolted up from unconsciousness with pink eye and thinking 'am I a lesbian?'             "
"                 I spent so much money yesterday, and more to come this weekend.  I bought a new down comforter, pillow, and mattress.  I can't wait to hook it all up, with my 440 ct sheets, I'm never gonna wanna get outta bed.  WOOHOO!!  I'm gonna get the mattress delive-d on tuesday.  Hopefull by then I'll already have the bed frame and desk I want.  I'm so 'cited.    Do you ever listen to music and it brings you back to a time forgotten?  Recently XTC's  Dear God  has been taking me back to last spring.  I guess it's in part due to the fact that it's fucking hot out in the District.  But it just reminds me of when I was moving out of Pittsburgh and I was cooking everything in my freezer.  I'd make like 5 meals a day.  I think one day I made burgers, perogies, two kinds of rice, two kinds of pasta, and pork chops.  That was fun.  I was like pouring olive oil on everything.  I guess that's the guinea in me (is that how you spell that?  or is that like a country?  I'm not sure, where do you even look up the spelling of racial epithets?).   Offensive Slang  . Used as a disparaging term for a person of Italian birth or descent.  IT IS!  Go me... get funky... it's my birthday!               "
"                 Guess what I saw on the way to work today (a perk of living in the Nation's Capital)?  Now don't quote me on this 'cause I have other theories too, but I saw what I think was a Harrier Jet.  I was driving along and I'm like 'that jet is moving really slow.'  A little later I notice that it prety much wasn't moving at all.  I mean I could be wrong, 'cause I was in traffic and delusional.  It was either that or a jet shaped baloon, or maybe a jet on a stick.  But then again it was green wheras in  True Lies  it was grey.  Do you think the Harrier Jet comes in more than one color?  I'd like to get one in sky blue, 'cause I'd be virtually invisible to people on the ground.  Oh the possibilities...             "
"                 So I checked the MTV fantasy thing, and unfortunately e kicked my ass! (something like 268 to 170)  BITCH!  Just kidding, I won't know the break down until tonight, I could only check out the total score.  'Paging Mr. Bigfatstupidloser?, Mr. Bigfatstupidloser your mother wants you home by 9.'    Other than that I have nothing to say today.  Ehh.  Fuck it.  I'm having a blah blah day.  But tonight is new  Buffy , so happy Trav.    I love you all, but d'ya know what I love more?  No, not anonymous sex.  Nicotine.  Off to smoke.  Late    PS.  I think someone got here by searching for 'thalky' on google, I hope they weren't looking for my bro or sis.  I should've picked something less confusing.  I'm stupid.  But in college people would call me 'Alky Thalky,' 'cause I'd drink like a horse, and it just kinda stuck (well in my head at least, nobody really calls me that anymore)             "
"                 So my new, or revisited, obsession right now is the Real World.  and with MTV doing the fantasy challenge for the battle of the seasons I'm giddy (and more than a bit pathetic).  I encourage all of you to sign up and make a team, then let me know what your name is so we can compete, ya know... like losers.  I already made e do it.  But today is the last day.    GO HERE   if you wanna have fun too. Or just waste some time.    I think I want to apply again (want to again, not apply again).  I've always just put it off.  But I think it'd be fun.  I'm such a waste of space sometimes.  I just want adventure.  Maybe I should just get lost in Jersey again.    Whatever, happy monday, and good luck with your teams (I know none of you will actually do it, and I say fuck you... I'll be having fun, and what will you be doing?  HUH?  Yeah that's right, nothing.)    PS 4 days until moving (well maybe 5, but 4 sounds better)             "
"                 Happy friday to all.    I think I'm gonna check out today at 3 'cause it's happy weekend, and the earlier I leave the less traffic I hit.  I'm in a good mood, but I just got to work, so I wonder how long that will last.    My sister was so moody and funny last night.  We were sitting and she was whining about chocolate, so she wanted me to get her a cookie dough Slim Fast bar (Okay, is the concept lost on me, or are those things supposed to be for lunch, not a post dinner snack), so I kept going to the kitchen and firing back the wrong ones.  Apparently we have like 4 types of bars in the house.  But she couldn't catch (maybe it's genetic, oh wait my brother can catch, and she's a girl and I'm a fag), so it hit her in the eye.  For the rest of the night she's like 'Am I swollen,' so I got her mind off it by saying, 'No, but one of your eyebrows is like an inch lower than the other.  You need to wax.'  I know it's not the nicest thing to say, but she was annoying.  Then a game of cards solved it all.             "
"                 I got really angry at my hair last night 'cause it's kinda long.  That bitch didn't cut it short enough.  Seriously I was like an inch from being sent to that island ( see last entry ).  So I whipped out the scissors and started cutting.  Don't get me wrong I wasn't like sculpting, I mean I'm no Edward Scissorhands.  I just thinned out the burns and cut a little off the back so it wouldn't curl under, it usually buys me a week and a half.  But now I have a bald line through my right sideburn.  I'm all sheepish.  But if anyone brings it up I have the perfect homo cover:      Person : What happened to your hair.  Me:      I know.  See I was trying to save some money for this new Kenneth Cole jacket so I went to Supercuts.  Big mistake.  I will never do that again.  There gonna hear from my lawyer in 2 to 4 days.  I should have known.  From now on only Dominique touches my hair.  She's a miracal worker with my roots.  I'm sorry I have to jam.  I'm off to Saks to pick up a new hat to cover this mop.     Whatta ya think?  Do you buy it?             "
"                 Boo!    Did I scare ya?  I'm cold right now.  I always get cold after lunch.  I guess it's 'cause it's the only time during the day I drink cold beverage.  God that was neither informative nor entertaining.  So I was looking through EW this week, and I came across an ad for  40 Days and 40 Nights  and I have to admit I'm intrigued.  I mean the movie is gonna suck, big time, but I'll probably see it.  I mean Josh Hartnett forgoing all forms of sex for lent.  It must be fraught with sexual tension and inuendo.  Fun, Fun.  I on the other hand have never, nor will I ever, give up anything for lent.  I don't get it.  Even for religious folk.  How is that 'proving yourself to god' or some such shit.  I would always mock give up stuff like: Homework, or taxes, or better yet women.    Did I tell you guys...  wait I'll do a little search.  I guess not.  I work with a Tom Jones.  I think that's so funny.  I told someone this the other day and they started to laugh, so I'm like 'It's not unusual.'  In addition to that I work with a Brian Wilson, and it's fun fun fun, just like lying in bed.  To top it all off I think I heard a page once for a Dennis Hopper, but I'm looking into that.  Sorry for the pittiful puns.    Come on 5 o'clock... Come to daddy!             "
"                 I forgot my phone again today. FUCK!!!    But regaurdless, I think I'm moving next weekend.  I just gotta give the complex a call and make sure I can get a parking space.  Woo-Hoo!!  I'm psyched.  You can't see me, but I'm doing the running man right now.  God I wore out so many shoes and stubbed so many toes in the early 90's with that.  What in god's name were we thinking.  I mean dancing is supposed to be sexy (to an extent) or at least beautiful.  When was the last time you said 'WOW!  Look  at that guy, he can run in place for hours while making ear-piercing noises with his Chuck Taylor's.  That is HOT!'  Or the cabbage-patch, I used to have a friend that was all about the cabbage-patch.  I would never dance with her 'cause she was uncoordinated and I got bruised.      So we made up our own, hot-hot dance moves like: Picking-up-the-change, climbing-the-wall, locking-the-door, and other daily activities, seemingly mundane, but foxy when the envelope was pushed.  Who am I kidding, it was just to make eachother laugh.  Getting 'sexy' outta those dances was like getting water from a rock.    Well I'm gonna go back to my silent desk and dream about furniture.             "
"                 Okay yeah I know I already updated this once this afternoon, but I have something to say now.    I don't know about the rest of you, but when I go out for a smoke I want a peaceful time to be with my thoughts, I DON'T want to make small talk with air-filter-replacing-mullet-man.  I mean what am I supposed to say 'when are you gonna wake up and smell the 'mullets-suck'.'  I mean, to some extent, they're beautiful, like all nature.  But like other critters they are to be observed occasionally for entertainment in their natural habitat, such as monster truck shows, wrestling matches, and country bars, not thrust into our world causing confusion and upheaval.  I was almost tempted to say, 'Honey, we don't talk to the help.'  What is a person to do when confronted with raw nature in an otherwise baked environment?  Do we A) nod and respond with short/noncommital phrases, or B) whip out the sheers and conduct displacement experiments?  I chose A, but B was eating away at me.  Maybe, to ensure the safety of everyone, especially the children, we should put them all on an island.    Well at least I was out there long enough to see cute firemen in uniforms.             "
"                 I'm not sure if this is a valid feeling.  Yesterday they came around with a card for a gift for one of my coworkers who had a baby.  This happens quite frequently.  I get kinda irked.  I don't know why.  Originally it was because I was here for a very short time.  Actually I saw the first one of them on my second day.  And since then there have been like 3 or so babies and 2 or so weddings.  I'm not made of money.  I know it's not a lot to give.  I can't figure out if that's the reason or it's just me being jealous of things that I will never have.  Go figure.  I could be that someone came by with a happy birthday sign and some candy for me yesterday.  It's not my birthday.  There is another Travis who started like last week, I guess it was his.  I didn't know they did such things here, since in my third month of working here my birthday came and left with no peanutbutter cups.  Can you still see me?  oh wait... you can't.    Sorry I'm in a funk, I think it's 'cause Im trying to get a heads up on the crest white strips 'cause I'm not gonna be home Friday, so I doubled up.  And man do my teeth hurt right now.    AC S-later             "
"                 I had a very interesting weekend.  Psha.  I did absolutely nothing.  I think the highlight of it was playing Egyptian Rat Screw with my sister.  I'm such a loser.  But she's so wacky sometimes.  She was really getting into it.  After ever game she'd be like 'I'm getting all swetty.'  She was a slapping fiend.  But I did get to watch  Newsies  and I almost cried, I would have if I didn't think Traci would get on me for it.  I just love that movie.  Maybe it's all the cute boys (okay, a good portion of them are of legal age, the others, well that's just sick) singing and dancing, and fighting.    Also I got quite a lot of QAF in.  I'm finally to episodes I've never seen.  I've come to the realization that it's not as bad as I had originally thought.  Strangely enough the lesbians are the best actors in the bunch, and are a large part of why I continue to watch.  Okay all the naked men contribute.  But I have a HUGE problem with the whole this is Pittsburgh thing.  I mean I lived there for four years and it's not that cool.  And they talk about the Susquehanna, okay dude there are three rivers in Pittsburgh and that is not one of them.  It's like 100 miles away in Harrisburg.  They also bring up my car: 'The Audi TT is a fuck machine, the guys who drive it usually aren't.'  Well... They just haven't met me... err... yeah that's it.    Well I'll hit you back when I'm awake later in the day.    By the way, is anyone else at work, I mean it's MLK day, show some respect.  I wanna go home.             "
"                 I think this is why I'm in such a good mood:     Let's do it     Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money  So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey  Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'  I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'  Introduce myself as Loc she said 'You're a liar'  I said 'I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire'  Took her to the hotel she said 'You're the king'  I said 'Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing  Wild thing  Wild thing     Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy  I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly  She looked at me and smiled and said 'You have plans for the night'  I said 'Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight'  So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other  I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother  I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string  She said 'Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing'  Wild thing  She loved to do the wild thing  Wild thing  Please baby baby please     Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype  And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type  Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine  The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine  Took her to the limousine still parked outside  I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride  Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling  But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing  Wild thing  She wanna do the wild thing  Please baby baby please  Wild thing     Doin' a little show at the local discotheque  This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck  She want to come on stage and do her little dance  So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance  So when the show was finished I took her around the way  And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say  We was all alone and she said 'Tone let me tell you one thing  I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing'  Say what  Yo love you must be kidding  You're walkin' babe  Just break out of here  Hasta la vista baby  Wild thing.

"                 It's almost the weekend.  I'm working hard (strangely enough), but ecstatic.  I've changed modes from listening to music just at my desk, to wearing my earphones all around the office.  I get weird looks, but it makes me a happier worker.    I'm listening to that Carbon Leaf song.  I've been talking about it way too much this week.  Sorry. No I'm not, I have to put up with your shit like all the time, the least you can do is humor me for one goddamn minute!    I can't wait to do absolutely nothing this weekend.  I'm gonna watch the rest of QAF and Buffy, but that's about it.  I'm not even going to do laundry.  Oh shit I think I have to cook dinner for T & J this weekend.  Just in case I leave my sister's like you better cook for us.  I think I'm just gonna brown some chicken breast in olive oil and make some pasta.  Hell I like it.  And maybe throw together some Italian wedding soup. yum yum, bubble gum, in my tum, 'gimme some!'    I'm in such a weird mood today.  I don't know if it's 'cause it's such a nice day, but who the hells knows.  I surely don't.  I kinda wish I had a digital video camera 'cause the birds were around again and I wanna show y'ins 'cause it's really cool.    Oh they were talking about Heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to 'mark their territory.'  So they peed on the field.  I only wish that I had peed on it when I broke in 'cause then I'd call the station and be like 'well I already marked it.'    Well that's about it right now.  (I have to fight the urge to do a cartwheel down the halls of the office.  Does this happen to anyone else?  I just can't help grinning today.)             "
"                 I'm thinking of making up a faux excuse to go home.  Here's how the conversation would go:    T: I have to go I have an Appointment Mr. Boss Man, Mr. Big Boss, Mr. BOSS MAN BING!: With whom? T: Um... Errr... Um... My... Chronologist. BMB: Why are you seeing a Chronologist? T: He puts my life in order *rim shot*    Then the harp I stole from Scrooge McDuck start singing; 'You are fibbing, fibbing, Fiiiiiibbiiiiing.' and Flintheart Glomgold swipes my stud finder, as the Beagle Boys make off with my car, and Magica DeSpell turns me straight (ewww.), and Launchpad and Doofus continually trip in the corner while Webby plays dress-up with Bubba.    What was I talking about again?     Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburgh Racecars lasers airplains it's a duck-blurr might solve a mystery or rewrite history                "
"                 I'm getting so sick of  Creed .  I mean it's not like I don't like the music, but c'mon.   My Sacrifice  is no second comming of Christ.  Actually right now, I think due to my long commute, Im sick of quite a lot of bands, here's a short list: Creed Lenny Kravitz Red Hot Chili Peppers Jane's Addiction Smashing Pumpkins Dave Matthews Band    This is not to say that I don't like any of this music, it's just lay off the repeat.  And what is with Duncan Sheik?  Since when is  Barely Breathing  in heavy rotation?  I think I was on the East-Bumble-Fuck station.  I mean you just have to save a little of your fame for later use.  I mean we all know what happens when you overplay.  Any one of these could be you: Hootie Cranberries Spin Doctors Hanson (ewwww) TLC    Forgive me if I put any one-hit-wonders in there, I was going for one big album, one ok album, than jack.    I don't know what this rant was about, but whatever.  I can't wait to get DSL, 'cause Amazon alone has all these downloadable  songs .  Especially  The Boxer , I have no speakers at work, so I can't.  But if you do, give it a listen.  Or at least the sample.             "
"                 I'm like a zombie right now, and I've been sitting in a strange position for the past 2 hours so my butt's kinda asleep.    This morning I loaded my phone up with Travis song, so that's what I've been listening to.  But I'm feeling kinda losery 'cause I keep getting  Baby One More Time  in my head (Travis made a version of this, that's actually pretty good).  Well less than an hour 'till I get to go home.    I'll leave you with a song:  Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Merry merry king of the bush is he Laugh Kookaburra Laugh Kookaburra Gay your life must be   ALL TOGETHER NOW   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Eating all the gumdrops he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra Save some gums for me   ONE MORE TIME!   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Counting all the monkeys he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra That's no monkey that's me     I don't know about you, but that woke me up.    ONE MORE TIME!             "
"                 Hey did anyone see the AMA's I didn't, but everyone (I mean radio) is talking about  urlLink Carbon Leaf  and I've heard one song on the radio.  It's big into the Irish thing, which I know is a little passe, but it's pretty darn-tootin' good.  But they're not really signed, so you can only get there CD in Richmond, which I'm not treking out there for a CD.  I'll just scour the web, when I get DSL.    So as the days progress I'm approaching definite on this apartment.  The deal is just pretty hard to pass up.    I was in Best Buy yesterday (there's a fuckin' surprise) and I got a little nervous due to my purchases.  I don't think I'm completely comfortable wearing my sexuality on my sleve, and that kinda bothers me.  I mean the way I dress it's a definite, but...  I don't know.  I just made the gayest purchase.  I bought Buffy Season 1, Newsies, Queer as Folk Season 1, and Moulin Rouge.  I mean I might as well been wearing capris pants and a midrif.  Am I a bad fag, or is my trepidation warranted?    But now it's work again.  I don't want to be here.  Just 8 more hours.  Well off to waste my youth and beauty at a computer.             "
"                 My last entry got me thinking:    Would you rather be smart, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with stupid people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me) and pretty, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with ugly people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me)...    OR.................................    Be dumb, like Melissa Rivers, and gorgeous like Mike Greybeal (or Jessica Alba for the ladies... actually she a great example, 'cause she's shit-rocks dumb)?    That's the big question, and I don't have an answer.  I would instinctively say 'I'd like to be like me,' but I would like to test out being ultra pretty.  Just for a month.  Can you imagine the ass you'd be able to get?  And maybe those stunads don't realize what it's like to have thoughts about the future, the world, politics, global warming, mandatory waiting periods for firearms acquisition, etc.    As Thomas Gray says: To each his suff'rings; all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan,—  The tender for another's pain, Th' unfeeling for his own.  Yet ah! why should they know their fate, Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise.  No more; where ignorance is bliss, 'T is folly to be wise.     And as Jessica Alba says: HUH?    Speaking of dumb my sister asked me for a review of fractions.  I started laughing at her: This comming from the girl who got one of the 2 A+'s in Criminal Procedure, I mean incredibly intelligent, but she wants a mult/div fraction lesson.  I told her to just use a calculator, and she's like 'I was going to until my friends were talking about the final saying how they couldn't believe how some stupid people brought calculators to the exam.'  She was sheepish, it was cute.               "
"                 Go me, I'm 3 lbs from my target weight.  I just checked this morning, but I don't know how reliable one weighing instance is.  'cause sometimes you havn't eaten in a while, or you drank a lot of water, or you took a really big shit, what have you.  So I hope it's for real.    My morning and evening routines have gotten longer.  I'm back on the Crest White strips.  They're the kick.  I think my teeth are currently at an acceptable level of whiteness.  (they were pretty bad before I did them in November)  Now I have a week and a half left.  So that twice a day.  Then I have like 6 new facial products to use, whereas before I had 1 (if that).  Also I shave like daily now, 'cause I don't want to put all crazy skin shit on my hairy faccia.  All in all I think it's working out, but my eyes are getting more easily tired.  And thanks to Jender and Swank for recommending Bumble and Bumble.  I like the styling creme.  (WHAT A FAG!)    And with my target weight almost accomplished I think that I may be ready to start working out.  (I have an easier time losing fat than transforming fat to muscle)  I can start with a blank slate (wait, it's clean slate, blank canvas.  I'm such a dumb-ass)    I just want to be pretty.             "
"                 Gee-Whiz I am sleepy.  I was up last night watching the Sopranos with my sis.  That show is the bee's knees.  I'm so psyched to have HBO if I move into that place.  And MTV considering the new season of Real World starts tomorrow.    I had a Hitchcockian moment earlier today.  I go outside for a nic-break right, and there are like 200 birds perched on the other building.  Then they swoop down into the trees that line the sidewalk in like a steady stream.  It was pretty cool.  I just wish they were louder (like crows not like chirp-chirp) and it was night.  I love having 'Birds' moments.  It's so spookey and fun.  But they were gone the next time I went out.    I forgot my phone again today.  I'm such a lame-ass.    Knob-it,             "
"                 So I checked out that place, and I'm gonna give it a favorable review.  Not because it's so rad, but because I'd have money to have fun with.    It'd save me like 5 C-notes a month.  And we all know how I like to spend.  So I'm jazzed.  Speaking of which I'm all about this line of Crate and Barrel shit.  I'm looking for some pics to link to.   Desk  and  Bed  Do ya like it?  There's also these  shelves     And my sis showed me this crap she got at Target, like desk accessories etc. that would go great.    Well I'm off to think about moving.    Oh shit...  I just noticed, the 5 shelf shelves (redundancy) are no longer available, I should go back to the store and snatch a coupla those bad boys up.  Maybe this weekend.  This would also separate some of my furniture into different months credit card bills.  And stave off my compulsive instant gratification desire.  THE REASONS ARE THREE-FOLD!!!             "
"                 Tonight I go look at that place I was talking about yesterday.  I hope it's cool.  I have nothing much to say today.  I've been a little nervous, 'cause I want this to work out.  Smoking a lot.  I hope he's normal, and not ugly, but not too attractive.  (Is it weird to have stipulations about how the person you live with looks?  Well I guess not so much weird, but shallow)  I don't know, It's been like 3 years since I've lived with someone I didn't know.  I just hope the age difference doesn't show too much, 'cause I still want to be able to watch cartoons and play video games.  Look at me running off at the mouth when it's not even definite.    Whatever, I need a cigarette...             "
"                 To begin today, a little update.  Oral-skank still hasn't gotten back to me, but I did get a response from someone else.  Now tell me what you think.  $625 (excellent), all utils including DSL and cable (right on), parking etc.  Sounds too good, well it may be.  He's 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69.  I'm a little concerned about this.  Maybe he's just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something, but didn't we grow out of that in like 6th grade?  Well I mailed him back and asked some questions.  Move-in would be mid-Feb.  And on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east.    Okay on to a new subject.  My sister brought this up last night.  On Jeopardy they just say 'in the form of a question,' and they don't really expound on that, so she was like 'If I got on Jeopardy instead of saying 'What is Jupiter?' I'd say 'Is it Jupiter?''  This went back an forth until we got a little out of hand, here's some possibilities for Jeopardy answers:    Old Way: What is... an American Bulldog? Where is... Milan? Who is... Elizabeth Taylor? What is 'On Top of Old Smokey?' What is... Pizza?    New Way: Did I just run over... an American Bulldog? Do they have whorehouses in... Milan? Does anybody really care about... Elizabeth Taylor? Have you ever had sex... 'On Top of Old Smokey?' Do you throw up from eating too much... Pizza?    See the improvement? I do. Stimu-lator             "
"                 Today's getting better.  I'm making myself laugh.  Also I went to Wendy's for lunch in memoriam.  When I got in there  Travis  was playing on the sound system.  I was like 'Even from Heaven, Dave Thomas, you have wonderful taste.'  But then the guy charged me 50 cents for some BBQ sause.  Snot-nosed-older-than-me-yet-working-at-Wendy's ASS!    Looking back on today I think I would do things differently to be funny.  D'ya ever do that?  It's kinda annoying, 'cause you're like 'Damnnit, I coulda been funny, but instead I was a sniveling mule.'  This morning when the police officer was waving me over (he was on foot), I should have just looked at him stupidly and waved.  Pretending he was just being cordial.  Now that would've been funny.    And at Wendy's today, when that guy charged me for some topping that probably cost 30 pesetas I shoulda been like 'Dude, show some respect.  Dave Thomas died today.  Now you gotta ask yourself: What would Wendy's founder Dave Thomas Do?'    Ooh, that's a good bumper sticker, WWWFDTD.  Maybe not, it either sounds like a web site for flower delivery, or something you'd find on  Sunday Smackdown .    Well at least I'm feeling a little more up.  Maybe that's because I've decided not to stay late today, maybe not, who the fuck am I kidding, of course that's why.             "
"                 Today SUCKS!!!    And it's only 9, I can't wait to see what happens later.    1) I forgot my phone so the only way I have music to listen to is if I go outside to get my CDs out of my car.    2) I got a ticket this morning, 44 in a 25 (School Zone).  Fuck that, I swear I was going 35, I was still in 3rd gear.  I'm going to do some internet research into the efficacy of Laser in adverse conditions.    3) I haven't heard back from the Dentist Bitch (I'm sure she's perfectly nice).    4) I may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products I've been using; I can't stop sneezing.    5) I can't think of number 5.    6) I'm going to Jender's tonight, and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from Red Pepper (If you're reading this just pick something that we wrote 'good' next to)    7) Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder and friend to all grease lovers, died.    So Have a Fucking Good Day!  I know I won't.    PS. Hey I think I may have come up with some sort of general idea for a script, but I have to flush it out in order to see if it would make a good flick.  Hey it keeps my hands occupied, otherwise there'd be a party in my pants every hour on the hour.             "
"                 I am a marketers wet dream.    I saw this little piece in Entertainment Weekly (my bible) about a line of skin care products for men.  So I decided to get some.  I've never really used any, and I'm entering my self-betterment phase of the year, so I bust out the plastic and head for the mall.    The only place I could find them was Saks, and I must say I was not really pleased with their service.  I guess the 2 foot shelf for men's skin care is not really a money maker, but honestly.  I was browsing the shelf for Zihr for like 20 minutes, and not a single querry about how my search was going.  I go to check out and the woman was helping someone else while taking my credit card, so I didn't get to ask any questions.  Meanwhile I was borderline going to buy the shaving gel if I could've gotten a price from her, but nothing, so I said no.    So I get home after dropping a sizable load of cash, and that night I wanted to use the stuff, so I had to shave first (weekends are usually razor free for my lazy ass).  My sister flipped out when she heard the water running so long, she's like 'You're shaving at midnight???'  So I started using.  I bought the undereye cream (I'm such a mo), 'cause I have a genetic predisposition for black bags (and I don't mean Prada).  So I think I have to call one of my lady friends to see how to use this stuff.  I got bottles galore each with it's 10-words-or-less instructions so I'm kinda confused.  And also I'm curious about how long before it kicks in.  I mean if you start using moisturizer is you face instantly gonna stop producing oil, or do you have a coupla days with too much?  I hope I continue to use 'cause if not there's a Benjamin down the toilet.    Also I may have found a suitable place to live.  I gotta see if this 26 yr old Dentist chick responds to my e-mail.  Cross you fingers!             "
"                 I feel off today.    I was all swervy on the road this morning, but now I'm all in the zone at work.  I'm designing my ass off.  Well not really just improving on some things I half-assed earlier.    So last night I went to Borders to get an oragami one-a-day calendar, but they were out, so I bought a Screenwriting book instead.  It's interesting, I didn't realize how structured the process is.  Now all I need is to come up with an idea.  I hope it comes to me soon.  But until then I should read the whole book before I foray into that process.  The woman at the store was like 'oh, are you a screenwriter?'  and I'm like 'no, I just needed a hobby for this month.'  I fly through things so quickly.  I'd be surprised if I'm still interested in this come The Buffy Season 1 DVD release (Jan 15th, mark your calendars).  But I like to dabble in lots of hobbies, 'cause this way I get to learn a little about a lot of industries.  It makes a well rounded person, or at least a good Trivial Pursuit player.    Well that's about it.  Later             "
"                 I don't really feel like writing today.  Sorry.  I just don't feel funny, and I hate mediocre entries.  Sue me.    Oh last night I had an awesome dream.  D'ya ever have one of those love dreams.  Like full on chick-flick love.  Complete with sidestories, annoying secondary characters, and melodrama (the gays love their melodrama).  It was awesome.  I didn't want to wake up.  Much more satisfying than a sex dream, I mean I can much more efficiently handle  that  in the waking hours.    Here's to thinking about my dream man.             "
"                 Shit...    Back at work after a kicking New Year in Manhattan.  I had so much fun.  We went out like every night hang bummed all day.  But not much of it is funny beside the New Years party itself.    Well first off, do you know that there's this channel in NYC that plays  ads for porn?  It's great, but they wouldn't let me watch it.  Girls can be such prudes.  Oh and Friday night I run into an old friend from College at a bar in Union Square, I hadn't seen her in like 2 years.  NY is a lovely yet strange place.    Anywho, So we went out to the  China Club  at arount 8:30 or so.  It opened at 10, and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round.  (meanwhile I had half a dozen beers at Netsie's place)  Get back in line about a half hour before the doors open, and it's FREEZING.  There was a girl in front of us smoking and I thought she looked cold, so I offered to give her one of my gloves.  So we all started talking and her other friends showed up.  One was from Birmingham, and I'm like (in my head) 'Alabama?'  But then he started talking and he was obviously from England.  So he asked us where we were from and I'm like 'Originally, Connecticut.'  Well it turns out he's staying with people from Fairfield, right near my home Trumbull.  So Glove Girl was like 'Do you know Ellen Tollman?'  and I'm like 'Yeah, I touched her breast in 6th grade.' I was off the hook.    So we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing.  All of a sudden I notice that there's nobody on the Stage, so I jump on and start dancing, draging a friend with me.  So a little while after that I'm up on a block on the stage and I lose my balance.  I face-plant on stage.  Bam Bitch went down.  I was craking up so hard    Then a friend of mine wanted to go, so I made sure she knew how to get home and let her go.  Okay not my most chivalrous act, but it was like 12:30 and I wanted to partay!  About an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor (and a little on my new shoes I might add).  So Netsie packed her up and headed for the coast.  So we were down to 3.    3 am rolls around and I can't find any of the remainder of our crew.  Finally we hook up and take off.  By this time Times Square (which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club) was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th.  We make a quick stop at McDonalds.  I order a double cheeseburger meal.  When it shows up I get all pissed and am like 'There's only one!  I have two patties and one bun!  What the hell am I supposed to do?'  Well it turns out I really wanted the two cheeseburger meal, so I could share, but I was too gone to think straight.  (I have the same problem with Twin and Double beds, I can never remember which is which)    So the next day I get up at 9:20 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brother's place.  But with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp.                 "
"                 I had a weird dream last night about acid rain and the Looney Toons.  Sylvester's umbrella dissolved and his hair fell out.  But that's all I can remember, maybe I saw it on TV?  Maybe it wasn't a dream at all?  Hrmmm...    It's the little things in life that make you happy.  If I get into work and there's already coffee made I start beaming.  But I always have to feel the pot 'cause sometimes it's just yesterday's afternoon coffee. (that stuff is just raunch)    Still no word from Femme-DDS.  I'm starting to lose confidence.  You've done nothing but study swordplay?  Eeh... More a pursue than a study.  Have you ever considered Piracy?  You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.  Sorry got a little Princess Bride on the brain.    I'm gonna pay my ticket over the phone, I don't think VA transfers points  .  I hope not.  How funny would it be if I had to find a job in the city and couldn't drive my car 'cause I got dropped from insurance.  Well not really funny considering It's hard to find Engineering jobs IN cities.  And then my beautiful baby would become like a hemmorrhaging abscess on my bank account.  (dictionary.com just got like 3 hits for that one)    But all-in-all things are looking up, and settling down, after the money suck that was the holiday season.  Friday I look forward to tons-o-fun at Swank's swanky new pad.      Oh, did anyone catch the Real World Chicago thingy that was on last night.  Well it sucked, but I have a new love.  Chris the gay guy from Mass.  He's lovely.  But a recovering alcoholic, so that wouldn't really work out.  But I look forward to some hot man-on-man action this year.  Hopefully it's not lame like last year.  It's kinda sad that I still watch this.  I'm 22 you'd think I'd have my own life.  Now I have to feed vicariously off 7 losas.  Well maybe this year 6 losas and a hottie.    Off for more Coffee... Annihi-lator             "
"                 So as the day rises anew I contemplate the efficacy of my rapport with the human species.  Have I lost all propencity for serious thought?  I find myself have trouble going 10 minutes without crackin' wise...  OH MY GOD! Who was that?  It wasn't me.  Well tonight I get to go out.  WOOHOO!!!  I put myself on a $100 stipend this week, 'cause I was running low on cash (realistically I didn't think I could do it).  But tomorrow's pay day and I have $89 buck in the wallet.  Go T$$.  I know all of you are probably like 'thank god.  That dude's been dull since he hasn't been hungover.'  And believe me I'm with you.  I'm only really funny when I'm in incredible discomfort.  But I'm still gonna take it easy tonight.  'Cause I'm still gonna watch a little must-see-tee-vee.  Well that's good.. um... yeah... good times... Well feel free to type a little su'in su'in in the tagboard, it makes me feel loved.             "
"                 Well I finallly got arount o doing something with this site.  I think it's looking better, but there's always room for improvement, but I'm busy right now, so I can't write any more.    Later Lovers,  yeah you wish...             "
"                 So I kicked Netflix into high gear.  But today has been boring, I've been staying in all week, and I'm ready to go out, but I'm gonna wait at least until Thursday.  I'm not really feeling particularly funny today, or interesting, or even awake, so I'm gonna keep this really short.  Well I'll catch you guys on the flip side. (it's Wednesday... here's hoping for omelettes tomorrow)             "
"                 A few things today: I was listening to the radio this morning, and some people are nuts.  On  WHFS  (who I think is trying to get a little edgier) they were at the Grammy's talking to porn stars, and there was either taking pictures of unclothed women or oral sex, I was switching during the commercial.  And, in the spirit of  Grand Theft Auto ,  Elliot  was talking about a game he wants to get backing for, where you're terrorists who take over the Olympics, which I think is a little too out there.  Reguardless of wether or not it's fun, I just think it's too reckless.      However I came up with a game that has edge, and also is less politically offensive.  It's called  Homeless  or maybe  Grifters  but the latter is a little more restrictive.  I'd like it to be a rags to riches adventure where it begins with some simple panhandling/pickpocketing/mugging then progressess to grifting/prostitution/robbery and from there to cock-fights/drug-trafficking/pimping and finally to wetworks/heisting/kidnapping.  And along the way your personal concerns will change as well.  In the beginning your only goal will be securing hootch and rinsing out your only pair of socks, but by the end it will be setting up an offsure bank account in Grand Cayman, and buying a mansion in a non-extradition country.

"                 Well here's another dream, it didn't come last night 'cause I woke up every 10 minutes for some reason, but rather yesterday napping in the noontime sun.  (Check out  White Stripes  -  Fell in Love with a Girl ... That's good punk)    So I had this dream where I went to my distant cousin's house for a funeral.  I was walking around talking to people, and noticing that there was a lot of inappropriate touching between men for calling hours (Is that even what it's called?).  So I'm on my cell with e ('cause that's like all I do lately).  I drop the phone and go to pick it up, but I can't hear anything anymore.  Then I hear a little 'hello-hello' comming from my water glass.  I just kept running up to people laughing and saying 'hey my friend's stuck in this glass.' - 'Say something to this woman Erica.'  Then I realize that both the microphone and the speaker of my phone are rolling around in the glass.  I shut up 'cause I feel stupid now.  Meanwhile back in the funeral of inappropriate fondling, clothes are kinda comming off and I'm perplexed.  I turn to my friend and am like, 'I'm getting the feeling that this is not so much my cousin's house as it is a gay brothel.'  I guess I got the address wrong.  Ooops.    Meanwhile back on earth.  I think I either have a food alergy or a gum inflamation.  I'm not happy with it.             "
"                 I have seen the face of god, and damn that boy is fine.  No really, I went out last night and I have about 30 nightime don'ts for you.  So after I stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and Jender went home I went out a bar (yeah, news to whom?).  I want to appologize to everyone I called last night.  Especially e who got a call at like 3, or as I like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home (hang on I'm getting there).    So I'm out at a bar that's playing the gayest moments in movies, or some such shit.  Like the funeral from  Steel Magnolias  the first performance from  Sister Act  etc.  I see the hottest person in the world (my fucking luck, he was a bartender, Mike... Mark... Milk...  It's not important), so I go talk to him.  Long story short I make friends with 3 really hot guys (him his boyfriend, and a friend from NYC).  At least I got to see two really hot guys kiss.    So they invite me to a club, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I can take that.  This was like the hottest selection of guys I've seen in my life, but shallow like a fox.  I need to work out, 'cause just losing weight makes my skinny, but not hot.  These guys were all shirtless and gorgeous, and meanwhile I'm like 'I've had 5 hours of sleep since thursday, gimme a break.'  (So I pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor).  Okay I think were ready for the don'ts, this story got boring.    I think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day... It's a veritable who's who of crap.    DON'T: 1. Don't go Out to a club with ppl. you've known for like 30 minutes, even if they're hot, 'cause they don't have your back. (okay like 2 hours is okay) 2. Don't call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on Saturday, 'cause they ain't home, and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style. 3. Don't call them at 9 the next morning either, 'cause they're just mad. 4. Don't go to a club on no sleep, 'cause you ain't looking pretty. 5. Just because you see the Washington Monument does not mean you can walk home. 6. When thinking about walking home, call a cab, it's easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night it's not fun. 6. Don't question black earwax... it's just happens sometimes. 7. When your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks, find another way, don't hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train. 8. Don't 'balance-beam' on a railing 30 feet above traffic, while tango-ing with an oak. 9. Don't go out when you're still hungover, 'cause the beer shits catch up to you while you're walkin' past the Smithsonian. (worth mentioning twice.)    Okay Peace out. Live it Learn it Love it.     Note: preceding event have been exaggerated for humorous effect, I was really not in danger, even e thinks so.              "
"                 Yeah, I'm messed up, I just spent the last hour and a half staring at a chicklet,  So much has happened since last we talked.  Well I sent out my tax stuff to my dad (okay lame start, but I'm saving the good stuff for later), and instead of a return address I put:  Jo Babbydaddy He knows Where!  It made me laugh, I'm gonna have to explain ebonics to him though.  So I went out last night.  I think there's a conspiracy against gays in that people are trying to keep us drunk.  'cause when I was straight I never went to bars that had whole nights where beer was free.  I mean how spiteful can you be.  So I was there with Spark and I went to 'buy' the next round.  I find out when I get back that Goodyear asked him if we were up for a threesome.  He's like 'No, sorry.'  But to me he's like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like 'Tubby I don't think so.'  Me I was like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like: 'Aww, Honey, why don't you head over to Bob's Big Boy and pick up a leg a wing and a biscuit.  There's a threesome, that's more your speed.  HaHaHa, I'm even funny with the rabble...  I'm Chris Rock.'  Spark was cracking up and was like: 'Oh yours was much better.'  He's right you know.    So later that evening, (yeah I missed MK skate, but I'm glad I would have cried) I hit on some boys.  Most of which had boyfriends... or lovehandles.  But this one I was givin' the hungry eye to was cross room flirting.  Nothing became of it, so a few hours later I approached and was like 'I'm doing some market research.  Why didn't you respond to the eye?'  I'm totally not kidding.  I'm such an ASS!  I was T-Ravis-Rashed.  But I gathered some good info on his demo, and got a few nice compliments.  But that sucked... compliments don't play the piper.    So I get home at like 4-5-6.  Honey, I don't remember, I was too tired.  And I wake up at like 10.  All last night I was professing how I was gonna call in sick, but I didn't here I am at work.  So I drive in and I'm all about getting McD's breakfast (hungover happy).  So I pass two Don's in the Disctrict, and make my way to Annap.  I get to the one here at 10:45 and I'm like 'Are you still serving breakfast.'  The guy laughed at me and was like 'No, we stop serving at 10:30.'  I wanted to be like 'Dude, you don't have to laugh, it's 10-freakin-45, it's not like it's 3.'  So I go to pull out and low and behold little Ms. Hunchback with a dog backs into my Sgt. Hughes.  F'that.  I need to get work done now, I'd be rippin' mad if I wasn't so funny.    So I had this excuse all prepared.  'cause everyone else at work uses their kids to get outta stuff (yeah like I buy that Timmy needed to go to the 'doctor').  So I'm all ready to be like: 'Sorry, Janey had a dentist appointment and the little one got an earache, but what are you gonna do?  at that age, you just can't get mad at them.  Even though you just wanna hit them and take away their walking privledges.'  But I didn't have to use it since I got into that accident.    A coupla new things.  My favorite thing to say now when people bring up current events that I'm not familiar with is to say, 'oh I'm sorry, I don't watch straight porn.'  That and I started answering the phone by saying 'Go ahead caller, you're on the air.'  Also, and this is the best one.  I slipped up and said: 'That is so sugar.'  Instead of sweet, I think I'll keep that one.    Pop-u-later             "
"                 I'm so bored that I'm playing a rubber band rendition of  Mr. Sandman :    Bum-bum-bum-bum, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream Bum-bum-bum-bum Make him the cutest boy I've ever seen Bum-bum-bum-bum    What time does Michelle skate tonight?  'cause I may wanna go out.  Go Kwan, go Kwan, get funky.  I was talking to Tim, and I'm like wouldn't it be funny if my deal was that I shot people with rubber bands, but right before I struck a pose?  They'd call me  The Rubber Bandit  and my sidekick would be  Paper Clipto .  We would rob from places like Staples and Office Max.  Hehe, I'm insane... no really.             "
"                 So something in the hall is making noise like a wind up toy.  I'm so tempted to run around the office saying 'Is somebody playing Scategories!!! I want in!'    I think if I win Powerball tonight I'm gonna rent a little old lady to come in to work with me tomorrow and set up and omelette station.  I could go up to everybody and be like: 'Hey have you guys eaten, 'cause Edna here makes a killer omelette.  GET BACK IN THERE BITCH!!! YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK AND WE'VE GOT SOME TAKERS!'  Nothin' says share the happy like an omelette made to order.               "
"                 I know I just posted an entry, but I needed to get this off my chest before I forgot.  My officemate is just  on  today, he's been making me laugh all morning.  When I told him about my  Daily Grind  idea (which, after a discussion with Jender last night, has incorporated personalized catalog shopping, sound cool?  Send money and I'll get it on it's feet) and he's like 'Ooh, like  The Peach Pit  and   The Peach Pit After Dark .'  Hehe.  but better yet is what just happened.  See, lately I've been havin' a hankerin' for a McD's breakfast (a BEC 'scuit to be exact), and I was talking about how they should delive.  Then I went on to tell him how someone I was talking to live in a place where they had McPizza and they dilivered.  So this is how it went down.  Keep in mind I was trying to say 'Test Market'.  (Look at me, it's like I'm setting up for a blooper.  I'm Dick Clark introducing a Carol Burnette flub)     Me:  So I was talking to someone and they had McPizza in their area, I think they lived in... ah... What's that called?  Tim:  Um... I don't know... The Czech Republic?    I cracked up.  I hope that translated well, but I'm not sure, it was one of those timing thing, Like Jender's 'Haa cha cha!!!'  this weekend.             "
"                 So did you catch Michelle Kwan's performance last night?  It was pretty good.  I was torn 'cause that was on at the exact same time that the UCONN game was winding down (FYI: they were down by 5 through like the entire 2nd half, they just couldn't protect from the 3's and giving up a lot of boards [geeze you'd almost think I was straight], but somehow things turned around when Michelle was skating, she's done so much for me [okay not too straight]).  I think I OD'd on parentheticals.  I don't know why I like Kwan so much; maybe it's 'cause I think that she's a good role model, a good symbol of America, or maybe it's because she's really my mother.  And a good showing by the other Americans going 3-4.  Woo Hoo.  That stupid Slutskaya ruined the 1-2-3.  I don't trust that girl.  She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up 4 days later in a onesie in Georgia with a  South of the Border  sticker on my ass.    Damn I'm wierd.  I'm becomming one of those crazys (thats what we call my cousins from West Virginia).  I'm thinking of going to see a hypnotist this weekend.  He was on the radio this morning and it seemed like a lot of fun.  I'd like to participate, 'cause I think that I'm funny anyway, so maybe under the influence, I'd be a laugh riot.  People at work probably think I'm very strange, I'm chair dancing right now to  Basement Jaxx  -  Where's Your Head At , it's funny 'cause it's true.    Last night after watching a very homophobic  Blossom ... erm... I mean  Real World  and a new ep of QAF, I was flicking and put on  Darkwing Duck .  Spark got a weird look on his face, and I'm like; 'That's okay we can put something else on, I'll just watch it in 10 years when nostalgia is in.' HAHAHAHAH!!! I'm cracking up, but not because of that, that was kinda lame, but because of the onesie joke before.              "
"                 So I'm back on a dream of days past ( see past ).  I've been thinking a lot about winning powerball and opening  The Daily Grind .  But now it's expanded to be a coffee shop/bar/bowling/pool etc.  (ooh, ooh, and maybe it could have like a neon strickthrough and the word Nightly, so at night the name changes)  The best part is I'd sell magazines.  Y'know how it is when you're like: 'Hey let's go get some magazines.'  And your friend is like 'Wicked idea, but where do they sell those?'  Look no further.  But it wouldn't be very successful 'cause I don't like stress, but I wouldn't mind 'cause I'd have my PB winnings.  God, why can't  I  have a failing business.  I'd also have  Trivial Pursuit  cards all around, 'cause I was at a place where they did and I thought it was cool.  What else, oh yeah, boxed wooden matched only.  Can't you picture it?  I'd call you up and say 'Come on down to  The Daily Grind ,' I'd say, 'It's half price  Corona  and  Condé Nast .'    Gotta go; I just choked on my own spit, damn I'm a moron.             "
"                 Good Morning, Good Morning, we've talked the whole night through, good morning good morning to you.    Not to me, I'm beat.  I got in late, but it's president's day, and I for one think that nobody should be working, let alone me.  My excuse was that since schools are out I had to find an appropriate day care for my kids.  Like I'd ever have kids.  I dried my sweater way too much.  It's tight.  Even for me.  I guess people at work will just think I'm even stranger.  I guess it doesn't help that my jeans have big cuffs at the bottom 'cause I have to wear them low to accomadate the tattoo.  Hey when it's all better I'll put a nice picture up of it.  It's zzzexy.    I'm so pathetic, just looking at those z's made me tired.             "
"                 So it's sunday night and I'm trying to decide what position I will play in this new society that I have become a member of.  I have to get past my shyness, but I fear that I may go too far.  I don't want to become the slut, or do I?  It's also a valid position, but I'm not sure what's for me.  I've realized that I'm young, and hot, and pretty much, I can decide what I want.    Is it lots of sex with people I don't know, or is it something more?    I don't know             "
"                 I had a dream that I came home and there were a dozen boxes of  Harry and David  pears on my doorstep.  Why am I subconsciously getting fruit delivered?  Maybe it's 'cause my mom hasn't ordered me any  Omaha Steaks  in a while.  I'm such a spoiled brat.    Okay so last year my brother got me these  Deisel  jeans and they're awsome, but I was fat then, and they're about 3 inches too big in the waist.  So now I look at myself in the mirror, and even though I'm swimming in these puppies I look fat.  But I'm done losing weight, and I can't aford to get another pair.  So here's my idea.  Do you think I can call my mom and ask if she'll pay for it?  I mean it's for my health.  Maybe not.    I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets. This pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it.  A few minutes later he was beaned by a can of  Ensure  I had to laugh, I can just picture it: 'To your health Fucker!' (Whooosh - Boink!) Hehe.             "
"                 Happy freakin' Valentine's Day to all you.  Every year I think I should be all depressed on this day, but for some reason I'm not.  I mean I've never really had anyone on this day, so I guess I don't know what I'm missing.  I guess when it comes down to it, I'm gonna get depressed about not only this day, but the other 364 as well.  I guess it doesn't help that my hair is looking a little...  well lets not get into that... I think I have to go see a doctor about a certain... shit I don't wanna talk about it.  It's not like it's getting bad, but I've just talked to a few people who are like 'nip it in the bud.'  I mean my bro has had his share of difficulty with it, and he always warns me, not to mention my trick this weekend said something about early action.  (yeah like that wasn't embarrassing)    This is fucking great, now I'm in a spectacular mood.  Why'd you have to bring this shit up.  Thanks a lot!    On another note, I think I am done dieting.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I'm like: 'hey, you're skinny.'  And not just straight skinny, that's easy, but gay skinny.  So I can eat what I want now.  I think I'm still gonna stick to diet coke (damn Freud will not let me type that word cleanly) 'cause I don't wanna rebound.    Okay I'm in a better mood.  And hey you gotta be happy when you only have one day left of your moneyless week.    Hey check out  Phantom Planet  -  California  it's really good             "
"                 How 'come cartoon pigs all have stutters?  Porky, Piglet, I'm sure there have been others.  What is it about the pig that we find it is necessary to impede their speach.  Is it 'cause they are so cute in drawn form we must even the score so the other barnyard animals don't get jealous?  It was just a general wondering-ment I was having.    Geeze I'm ready to go home.  I'm so tired.  If you were to ask me to pick up a brick right now I'd say: 'Fuck no, pick it up your own damn self.'  Did I mention I was cranky too.             "
"                 Damn it's hump day.  I was listening to the raadio today and they were talking about this event they're having comming up called Kegs and Eggs.  It's a party from 8am-noon.  It sounds like a lot of fun, but it's on a friday.  It seems kinda messed up to take a whole day off just for a four hour party.  And it seems like the think that you may stumble home from not walk.  But Carbon Leaf is playing.  I'll think about it, it's a month from friday (2 days prior to Jender's Birthday).    On another note I just ran out of money (I mean until friday).  I kinda flipped out yesterday about it.  Then I realized I have another check before next rent.  It's just with these alimony payments now, I have to rebudget.  Yeah I know that's a lie, but I thought it was better than I spent $300 on a blanket and a pillow.  Sometimes I just have to give myself a knowing look and say: 'Where's your head at?'             "
"                 So I've been watching the Olympics a lot.  I love it. But last night was heartbreaking.  What happened during the pairs free-skate (long program).  It was Canada hands down.  The the Canadians were like 'This is horseshit... you call this a sport... We skated our asses off.'  Oh wait that was DB Sweeny.      Then I caught the end of the US men's curling match against Canada.  Not pretty.  We conceeded at 9-3 in the 9th.    But I guess I couldn't be too upset with the men's halfpipe sweep by Americans.  That was awesome.  Single-handedly put us back in the medal run lead with Germany.  I love that shit.  I almost cried when I saw all three American flags going up.  It gets me.  Kinda like that commercial with the guy who takes a picture of himself sleeping and writes 'wish I was here xx,' on it.  It melts me.             "
"                 So I'm thinking of getting another tatoo.  Well I've wanted one for a while, but here's my reasoning.  I want to get it on my tummy.  For one I think it's sexy, but also I think it may deter me from getting fat, 'cause I wouldn't want to stretch it.  It would also detract from my less than washboard abs (or maybe it'd accent them, who knows).  So what do you think?  I'm not sure if they'd let me since my navel is pierced, maybe it's like a cart before the horse sorta thing.  But I don't know what I'd get.  The first one I had planned for a while, so I knew what I wanted, but this one, I'm not sure.  If you have any suggestions  urlLink guestbook  me.  I know I don't want any living things like dragons or lizards (I don't do that tounge thing...) nor birds of prey.  Plants?  ehhh... I think I like designs.  Well if I get bored today I'll doodle.    Pinches for all-             "
"                 I'm officially the stupidest person in America.    I was doing laundry today while talking to e.  I get back to my place and realize that I locked myself out.  Okay lets set the stage.  I did a little drinking last night (and got a little lucky too) so today I have those pesky beer shits.  So I'm locked outta my apartment with no shoes, and none of the maintnance people are home... 'cause I'm that unlucky.  But what I could do was finish my laundry (read silver lining).  Wait I can't finish this right now I need to shower I still have sex on me.    Okay clean as a whistle.  And one of my neighbors was singing really loudly.  I took that time (I was given the gift of time) to catch up on my correspondence (there wer too many  Friends  quotes in there).  So then singer/songwriter with a clay mask came out and tried to help me locate someone to let me in.  Finally I had e scratch up my roomate's cell.  So I give him a call.  He's in Baltimore.  An hour later I realize I have my emergency plastic key and I can go get cigarrettes outta my car.  I go down into the grage closing the (locked) door behind me effectivly trapping me in the garage.  Luckily when I finished the cigarrette my roomate drove in.  I was soo happy.  He was carrying a big box so he threw me the keys, and as a good gay man I missed them.  They hit my square in the right nut.  A perferct end to a perfect day.             "
"                 I am officially - borderline - alcoholic.  I woke up this morning at 7 on my bathroom floor covered in vom and with heavy boxers.  I've never shat myself before, I guess there's a first time for everything.  I'm so embarassed.  That's why I'm telling all you's guy's.  I have to go shopping for our party soon.  See this is the shit that happens when I hang out with my brother.  I'm just glad I wasn't in bed, 'cause I have expensive sheets.    I think I danced with Annie last night.  You know the little orphan.  Dog by the name of Sandy.  She's okay, but really cheap.  She claims she's had a 'hard knock life' and I'm like take a number sister, I just crapped myself.             "
"                 CAN YOU FEEL THAT? AW SHIT OOOH-AH-AH-AH-AH!    It's friday.  And if anyone can't tell I have DSL.  It's like I've been freed from a 4 year prison of slow transfers and drop offs.  I don't even know when I went to bed I was having fun looking for... um music... yeah.  If you wanna talk to me I'll be on IM a lot more.  I'll still be away all day at work, but at nights.  It's the kick I d/l'd like 8 songs before work today, including Disturbed's  Down with the Sickness  (which explains the intro).    I think my brother is comming to town today.  Which means one thing.  Wasted friday.  I gotta find out soon what we're gonna do 'cause we have that party tomorrow night.    Do you know what today is?  It's day one of the 19th Winter Olympic Games.  I'm so psyched, but the only thing on today is ski jumping.  Well everyone enjoy their day I know I will.

I hate networks.  I don't know if it's me, but I'm not sure if my deoderant is working.  I think a certain Old Spice is gonna have to buy a certain someone a stick of his old stuff.    Tuesday when I was out, I was playing pool.  I had a few drinks so I was shooting really poorly.  I actually used the phrase 'well, at least I'm pretty.'  I think it shows a lot fo personal growth.  I hope I'm getting past my poor self-image thing.  I mean listeng to someone's self-mutilating banter is about as fun as listening to two bluejays at a Melissa Etheridge concert.    So I guess I'm off to drop a few bills this afternoon too.  Shit, but as I always say: 'You gotta spend money to watch porn.'             "
"                 Someone just googled to me by searching for: 'Communism in North America.'  Boy were they dissapointed.  Well I'm just assuming, 'cause I didn't actually talk to them.    I've been thinking lately about people that were once in my life that I lost touch with.  One in particular.  She was my best friend from like 2nd grade 'till 8th grade.  I haven't talked to her in like 5 years.  Whenever I run into people from THX I ask them about her, but I never seem to run into her.  I guess part of me just kinda misses her.  I mean this is the girl with whom I organized apple sauce straw races in elementary school.  (Which is how I still eat the stuff, and where I got my fondness for sucking stuff.  Sorry, that was both disturbing and ill-timed)    Well I guess I'll never talk to her, but maybe next year at our 5 year.  Damn I need a date.  Oh, but you don't really show up to 5 yr's with a date, that's more of a 10 yr sorta thing.  I'm kinda curious to see who else from highschool is a rough rider.  I've only heard about like 3 people comming out.             "
"                 I just read my horoscope today and it said:  'Don't even think about working today, you have no focus.'  And man is it right.  I'm psyched I have an out now.  If they ask me to do something I'll just be like.  'Sorry can't, I got orders.'      Whack! Smack! what was that? Darkwing Duck is on the attack. This is where you'll find him at. Fighting crime like a maniac.    Does anybody else remember that commercial?  My friend Tine and I in 8th grade had a little dance to that, it involved slapping, jumping, and some tush flailing.  We'd do it in school all the time.  FLAME OUT!             "
"                 I'm back.  Unfortunately.  I got my mattress yesterday and it rocks my boxers.  If any of you reading this are cute boys feel free to come over and check it out.  I went out to a bar around the corner last night with Spark.  After Buffy, he's like do you wanna check out neighborhood bars, and who am I to pass it up?  It was kinda fun, but kinda dead 'cause it was Tuesday and everything.    2 days 'til Olympic Fever!!!  It's a disease, I'm gonna print out a pretty schedule when I'm through with you brats.  Oh shit I think I found a lump in my luging ankle, the Olympic Fibrosis is already starting, stage two is Curler's Wrist, then the dreaded sequining of my clothes to be like Kwan.  I may just go get the bedazzler to make it easier.    BE LIKE KWAN!!! BE LIKE KWAN!!!             "
"                 I just got my delayed hangover, I almost booted in the bathroom before.  This sucks, I don't understand, I was doing so well this morning, wakin' up on time etc.  Damn!  It's like a Kevin Costner movie, you wait so long for it to come, and when it finally does you're pissed that you were born.    (I gotta give a shout out to my coworker for that one.  I came up with the analogy, but I was constipated on who would be a good actor to name so I asked Tim)    I think it's the six pack of Amstel and 4-5 glasses of red trying to tell me something.             "
"                 I forgot to mention, I think the funniest one liner last night was made by Pawn.    The Bud Light commercial was on where the girl was preparing the room for sex.  And she's shouting down to her husband that there's candles and satin sheets and finally Bud Light then he runs up while stripping and dives on the bed but slips out the window.  So we're all laughing 'cause it's pretty funny and Pawn was like 'It's funny 'cause it's true.'  I couldn't take it.    My best showing was probably in the car when we were talking about the show I dunno I think it's called Elimidate.  So Pawn was explaining the rules and he's like 'so there's like a guy and 5 girls...'  and I'm like 'oh, I've had that nightmare.'  Timing was perfect.    Well I gotta go now.              "
"                 I am sated.    It only took me like 35 mins to get in today.  WOOHOO!!  And it only gets better, 'cause I had to walk to my car this morning.  But that in and of itself was great.  I live in a city now, and walking around at 8 in the morning people are everywhere.  It's wonderful.    I had a blast yesterday.  I went with my new roomate Spark to his friends' place.  It was just cool hanging with other gay dudes.  I was cracking up the whole time, they were really funny, and I was on as well.  Not to mention that the superty-bowl was awesome.  And the couple whos house it was loved football.  Which I found cool, I like well rounded asses... I mean homos.  Every time someone would come on screen we would shout out 'hey look it's...' and then put some weird name in.  Which was really funny drunk.  The Rams coach was called everything from Wilfred Brimley to Dame Judi Dench to Marky Post to Rerun.  Add in some 'tight-end' humor and drooling over Tom Brady, it was a laugh riot.    We were talking about valentines day and if Spark should get his boy of 2 months a gift.  Pawn suggested that it not be too relationshippy.  I started cracking up 'cause I'm like 'you should get him the pro-trim, and you can be like I saw how your eyes lit up when we watched that commercial.'    Well all in all I am happy about the move.  I think I'm gonna go get my computer today and my mattress comes tomorrow.             "
"                 Happy friday!    I'm happy, and also in possession of certain keys to a certain apartment.  Woohoo!  Now I can go anytime I want, it's like I live there already... wait I paid rent, so I do live there.  Took some measurements last night, and it looks like the bed frame I want is OUT.  I'm upset, but I'll get over it.  I'm probably gonna have to do the bed in a corner thing to get the desk in there, and my sister was like 'You don't want to close it off any more with a footboard, it'll make it look even smaller.'  Fuck her for being right.  But it does save me like 4 large (is large thousand or hundred? I think it's thou, but I mean hun).  So now when I get board today at work I'm gonna cut out little shape for furniture and play puzzle with graph paper, or possibly go to target to look for plastic (I want to make this shower curtain out of 4'x8' plastic rounded rectangles that are connected with loops.  I'm thinking green with a strip of blue at the top, and one second from the bottom.  all in all it comes out to 8 rows of 18 columns.  It's like 144 pieces and 414 connections.  But I think it'll look kick-ass.  I think I'm gonna have to cut up folders or something, it's impossible to find sheets of plastic.).  Well be in good spirits, and have a blessed weekend. psha!             "
"                 This week has been insane at work.  It the end of year for us on Friday and I need to get all this stuff done.  But I still steal a minute or two to move over some more old posts.  If you notice to your left there are some posts archived by month.  Have fun.  Other than that.  Did you catch 24 last night.  I was IMing with some guy so I wasn't giving it my undivided attention, but it was good.  Well I hope that these posts pick up.  Where'd the funny go?  I guess beat out of me by work.  But Crew Class starts Monday, so that's cool.  I hope it's fun, and helps me keep in shape.  Late             "
"                 Hello all, I've been itching to get back into the Blog thing for a while.  It's been a 2 year vacation....  We'll get into that shit over the comming weeks.  I guess I should introduce me.  I'm a 24 yr. old gay guy in DC from New England.  I've been here for just under 3 years.  I love it and think I've found home.  So I'm thinking about moving all my old Diaryland posts over, but that's gonna take a while.  Some day maybe you can check them out.  (I was thinking about neglecting to move the self-important, or self-loathing, or otherwise embarrasing posts, but that's not real)  Also the template is under construction, and I don't really know my Blogger shit so it's gonna be handicapped for a while until I get into the swing, so bear with me.  Enjoy!             "
"                 Awesome, it's a four day week, then a four day weekend, then another four day week.  Wahoo!  I can't even think about working right now.  Blah blah, I'm so not into it.  I was laying in bed last night and I couldn't fall asleep, I thought these damned cicadas were only suppoesd to make noise during the day.  I guess that was a false.  Well I gotta get back to work.             "
"                 I was on the Connecticut Post's site, wondering about the recognition of Massachusettes' marriages in my home state.  The I came across the message board.  I was so angered by everybody's use of 'god' in defining civil law that I needed to respond.  This is what I said;   Let's not stop at denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Let's deny all people the right to marry under the law. If marriage is such a time honored religious institution then the government (state or federal) has no place to recognize it. Let's establish civil unions, blind to race, gender, etc. to establish stability in household and the rights and privileges guaranteed to present day married couples. Then the church can have its marriage; thus averting the apocalypse that so many people have been referring to. And the religious right can continue along its morally superior, discriminatory, path to save us all. Religion has no place dictating the lives and lawful actions of those in a society founded on the principle of religious freedom. That it is already ingrained in our everyday lives is not a sound argument for perpetuating it's presence. The only purpose it serves is to alienate those who do not believe in the Judeo-Christian establishment, thus infringing on their religious freedom. Government should be secularized and god should be removed from the public sphere.             "
"                 Hey guys.  I have had this  urlLink song  in my head for a few weeks.  listen and enjoy.  Things have been going cool here for a bit.  I finished my rowing class and met a lot of cool people.  I start for real in June.  Um, I'm almost finished transfering all my old posts.  only 100 left.             "
"                 So I get my LSAT scores back next week, and I've been all over this forum where people are talking about admissions etc. and mainly the LSAT.  On the site people have been recounting their testing experience and trying to remember any question they can.  Through this I think I have built a false hope that my score is good, since I always seem to get the answer ppl on the forum think is correct.  Which is cool, but now I'm nervous.  To top it off (and not in the good way) I have heard from numerous sources that they hod gotten their scores early.  This kinda frightens me since I was prepared for them showing up on the 6th.  Oh well, we'll see. Cross your fingers and hope for Travey.             "
"                 I'm finally home, well at work.  After a grueling weekend.  I'll lay it down for you.  Firday I do (almost) a full day of work.  And get a ride to the airport at about 8 (car).  This I hop on my 35 minute flight to Newark (plane; yeah I know, it was dumb, but flyi.com doesn't start flying to JFK till next month or something).  After taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours.  Then I hop on a shuttle to Grand Central Station (bus), the Jersey transit system , in their infinite wisdom, decided that only one lane was required for entrance into New York City.  So my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours.  I get to the train station and look for the next train, well this was convenient, there was only one left.  I had missed the 11:22, and the 12:22 so it's the 1:30 for me.  I don't know if any of you have taken the 1:30 outta GCT, but unless you're intoxicated it's not fun.  It's like the drunk tank at county (does anyone know what county is?  Just sounded like somthing Perry Mason would say, or better yet, Matlock).  To top this off there was a Phish concert in NYC.  And if you know anything about me, you know I don't like Phish.  So me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids.  To top it off, the 1:30 makes EVERY stop through to Connecticut, so my 45 minute ride (train) took 2 hours.  Finally I roll into Trumbull at 3:30 and get to sleep.... 'till 9.  Saturday was nice, the wedding was pretty and stuff.  I really wasn't feeling the Catholic sercive, although who does. 'Honor' this, and 'serve' that, and 'make him a cheese sammich woman.'  The reception was cool, very Italian, but I ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that I haven't seen in like 8 to 10 years.  She's cool.  Danced like a fucking freak, caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend.  But 'sall good, when the three of us (Todd, Traci and I) get together it's in good fun.  Went to bed at like 2... 'till 6.  Sunday was really cool.  Went to the U.S. Open, not really a golf fan, but the weather was incredible and it's just overall a cool experience.  Kinda bummed that Phil doubled the 17th, but ehh... there was some good golf played.  This is a conversation I had with my brother's fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green.  Meg: Where's the hole? Trav: Megan you gotta remember these thing, jeeze. Meg: Do you know where the hole is? Trav: I got a couple ideas.  We got outta there at like 7:45, crammed 4 people in the back of my sister's Pathfinder.  And started a horrible trip through long island.  4 hours later (and about 50 miles), we roll into Manhattan and drop off Todd and Megan.  Then we trade off and each drive a bit.  My shift came on at 1:30 and was the last leg.  I was so tired, being in the sun all day and all.  Finally roll in at about 3:30.  All in all, horrible trip, but some perspective; it still was shorter than my trip up there... and I flew.             "

"                 I took the LSAT monday.  The culmanation of a 2 week blitz study session.  I don't want to go out on a limb and predict my score, but I think that I'll be at least comfortable with it.  The testing environment was much better then Oct. '02 when I last took it.  This time I think I'm ready to make the plunge, hopefully I can get in to the schools I want though.  But I have 3 weeks to obsess about how I did, and you know me.  I've already established a Y! group to try to compile everyone's memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct.  So far I've gotten most of them right, but I'm not sure about this one about 'Health Education' and Propaganda.  Anywho, that's all I got to say about that.  On another note I've been talking with this really kick guy on IM (but he know's about this site, so I won't go into detail about this...  if you want the skinny you can contact me ;) ).  Also I've been really blah at work, an I'm going to Connecticut this weekend.  I'm really hoping to slow down for a bit next week.             "
"                 So I was sitting on the john the other day and it was all rocking back and forth.  A few months ago the landlord changed our toliet 'cause it was leaking and causing problems int he apartment below.  Since then it has been a little less than stable.  So while I was using the facilities the other day I reached into my '5th' pocket on my jeans and pulled out a nickel and a penny.  I was able to shim the nickel in the from and the penny in the back.  Now it doesn't rock anymore.  Also I got my LSAT scores last week.  99th percentile... not bad.  Also, 6 days until I go on vacay to San Fran, I'm wicked excited.  PS.  I hope all y'all e-mailed your Senators this week.  I've been watching C-Span all week on the FMA debate.  Later             "
"                 So I found this site in a gay magazine.  urlLink ratemyschlong.com  I love it... added to the fact that there's some NICE dick on it. It's a great waste of time. I posted one of me... heheh... but it's pending.  My friend from CMU is comming to visit today. I'm psyched 'cause I haven't seen him on about 3 years and I've never seen him gay. Well I guess he was always gay, but I didn't know until last year. Oh yeah and he's super cute, but that's besides the point. I hope we have a lot of fun.  well have a blast on RMS, it's hella-addictive              "
