"                 After a lot of hard work, complicated JS ;-) and some nifty tricks, I have completed the first version of  CFX_JImage Studio  to demo our latest Java Custom tag.  The demo is cross browser (Mozilla and IE) and may (or may not) be slow on your connection.  To check it out, click the button below.  Please send feedback to  urlLink dmackey@gmail.com             "
"                 Here is something you might enjoy!  To boost our wonderful  CFX_JImage  tag and offer more 'Bang for your buck', we have developed a DHTML interface to the custom tag that people can use to either try the tag out or host online to quickly edit an image file on their server.  The main bulk of the application is complete but there is still a small matter of server-side organisation of files, REDO/UNDO and loading of image files etc         Above is a quick snapshot of what the application looks like. I am currently working on the  Filter Browser  dialog while Peter is tracking down some nasty Java bug that is preventing images that have been read from being released by Java. Looks like in the loading class, the Input file stream isnt being closed properly....  I am most proud of the  Rubber Band  effect used for cropping the image and placing the text for drawing!       "
"                 Peter is currently packaging up and writing the documentation for our latest CFX release on CFTagStore.com.  This tag rocks! It has various features and enhancements over similar solutions especially the rather cool  cropping  feature. The best part of this tag is the price!  Be sure to check CFTagStore.com and grab a copy of this tag ASAP! :-)  Dan.         "
"                 About 3 weeks ago, I got an invite to GMail. I singed up and was blown away with the interface and the DHTML etc (Especially the Spell Checking) but didn't really expect myself to use it as I rely heavily on my email account dan@digital-crew.com  But then something strange started happening! I have 3 computers on my desk, my main work PC, an iMac and my laptop.  The laptop is controlled by my Desktop via PCAnywhere (Cuts down on swapping mice and keyboards and is handy for transferring clipboard contents etc)  During my normal day, my Laptop sits there getting my email and its a dog of a laptop now. There are so many apps running as services. I develop on my Desktop.  I now find it easier to use my GMail account to answer tech questions due to the extremely handy feature of grouping all emails together in a  conversation .  Normally, I answer up to 20 emails a day and its time consuming to look for previous emails to refer back to but with this new feature coupled with GTray, I get my email instantly all grouped nicely together!  Google Mail, you are my new best friend!  Dan.       "
"                 Just finished my latest assigned project for a client bang on time!  The code is safely written to CD and ready for deployment tomorrow.  The project is an Intranet for a newspaper company which will allow storage of important information in a single database and help boost inter-office communication.  The particular project was completed 2 yrs ago but a much needed  CRM  section was required so thats what I have been working on for the last month.       I actually have to admit that its looking savage! Its near perfect on both Mac and PC. Being a newspaper, the Mac was a prerequisit so we had to get an old iMac in to help with compatability. Its amazing how far modern browsers have progressed!  IE5 on Mac sucks!  Dan.       "
"                 We are always striving to make better applications here at Digital Crew.  Many of these applications, widgets and components make their way onto  urlLink CFTagStore.com  so developers don't have reinvent the wheel when it comes to developing similar pieces of code.  I would like to give some insight into whats in the pipeline here at DC.   TeamWork Intranet   TeamWork Intranet is our main product encompassing all our components and applications into a group-based Intranet Environment. We dedicate Fridays to complete development of the product and are excited about its potential.  For more information :  urlLink www.TeamWorkIntranet.com    CFX_JImage   Peter is currently working on a Java CFX Tag for image manipulation that allows developers to perform a number of editing functions on images right from ColdFusion.  I am currently working on a complimentary DHTML interface to show off its capabilities and its looking damn fine.  Most proud of the  Rubber Band  effect for cropping images. More to come on that....   CFX_JSpell   My own personal delving in Java CFX tags is a GMail type Textarea spell checking component. The DHTML side takes all inspiration from GMail and is compatible with Mozilla and IE.  The server side code (CFX) can be run against a dictionary seperate from our DHTML interface. The Spell Checking Engine being used is Jazzy (Open Source on SourceForge.net)   CFX_JZip   This is an update to a tag I am selling on  urlLink www.CFTagStore.com . The new update will allow the user to  Add  to a zip file aswell as provide a spiffy DHTML interface for manipulating Zip Files.   CFMyAdmin   We are also excited about releasing Version 2.0 of our ColdFusion Based MySQL Database Manager  urlLink www.CFMyAdmin.com   The new version will support Indices, foreign keys and a full user account manager. We are also taking this opportunity to over-haul the data display and entry section.  So, thats a synopsis of whats in the pipeline and to give an oversight of what we're all about coming into the Autumn.  Regards, Dan.       "
"                 Finally, I have taken the plunge and started a ColdFusion Development Blog on the latest developments in ColdFusion personnally, with Digital Crew and CFTagStore.com  Seeing as this is the first post and I'm trying to work out what the hell is going on with the feeds and everything, I'll keep it short and sweet!  I'll say this though, the Interface for Blogger is savagely good!!  Dan.       "

"                 Ya know, my boyfriend always tells me how disappointed he is in me for not doing whatever he says at the time. Its mainly going out and drinking for the most part. He is always disappointed that I get tired at 2 am and that I dont stay up with him as late as I do my other friends which is 4 am because I cant get them to leave before then.  He tells me every week how disappointing I am and how predictable I am because I  get tired at the same time, I work a regular work week and do the same things after I get home. He lets me know he doesnt want me.  He doesnt even know he doesn't want me yet. I feel like I am only around until something better comes along. I am the first girl that has never cheated on him and he is disappointed in me all the time.  I am one of the few girls that has not broken up with him and it is almost like he cant break up with me. Sometimes I think he is only with me for the same reason any other person would be and when something better comes along he will be gone.  I cannot give him what he wants because he wants me to be someone else that I am not. He is so busy focusing on what he thinks is wrong with me personally.  I dont see  him saying anything good about me anymore.  I cannot change anymore than I already have. I have done so many changes that were necessary.       "
"                 Yesterday I went to the Internal Medicine doctor that I have. I have a total of 5 doctors and I am losing 4 out of the 5 when my new insurance switches over. I am bummed about it, but i found out something interesting yesterday at my visit.  All those specialists I have been going to, I could of went to the internal medicine doctor all along. No more psychiatry, dermatology, gastrology, gynocology, and the internal medicine doctor. I am rejoycing. Insurance companies are willing to pay for an internal medicine doctor way over anything else. I am so excited that I will not have millions of appointments all the time anymore. In the last 2 years, I have switched insurance companies 3 times.  It has been a rough ride when it comes to deductables and copays. Hopefully, this new insurance I will be on for awhile so I won't have to deal with this BS anymore.  My new deductable is only 250. The old one is 1,000.  Big difference!       "
"                 Lately I have become obsessed with a particular musician.&nbsp; I don't really know why. It's not like he's cute or I would want anything to do with him sexually. Its more like a mind pick. He is so strange that I cannot help but to read his words and listen to his music. I look at his art and obsess over the meaning. I obsess over his traumas that have made him who he is. He is so strange that I just want to understand or be able to see through his eyes at things.&nbsp; I wonder why people who they are. I usually attach myself to people who are considered different. This singer is called Marilyn Manson.&nbsp; He's so strange that even his girlfriend(fiance) is a fetish film maker.&nbsp; I don't think shes a porno star, but pretty close. She's even eccentric.&nbsp; I have been reading his book trying to get a better idea, but it only leaves me asking more questions.&nbsp; Kinda like, theres got to be more to it than that.&nbsp; He is such an outcast that he has gathered all the outcasts and made them the majority while everyone else has turned into an outcast.&nbsp; He is one of the most apatheic people I have ever heard of.&nbsp; He writes all this hatred yet he tries to come off as if he doesn't care.&nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; Its like an unsolved riddle. Unfortunately, I will never solve this one because he is a human being.&nbsp; Its not like I can actually talk to him and go,'what's going on up in that head of yours to make you so unique?'&nbsp; And even if I could, its not like he can answer a question like that. Who can! I know I cannot about myself.&nbsp; Well I guess I will continue to wrap myself up in his mystery/misery trying to guess what is going on and what is the route cause and why am I so drawn to a tortured soul? I guess one thing about reading that book is it has made him more human. I have stopped having nightmares about him and dreamed more that I was him and can feel what he is feeling emotionally. I play out the scenes in his book in my dreams. I guess that is my own fault since I read it every night before I go to sleep.  In any case, from one person to another, he's pretty different. I respect that.       "
"                 The most popular religion in America is Christianity.&nbsp; My dad's father was&nbsp;a Baptist Preacher. My dad has always been a little hypocritical to religion. My sister is a bible thumping fanatic. People get so caught up in something to believe in, that no one really stops and thinks about what&nbsp; it can sounds like.&nbsp; To me, the bible,&nbsp; is a bunch of fables that teach moral value.&nbsp; Those people might have existed at some time, but the stories are more like tall tales of what really happened.&nbsp; People don't see the bible as a teaching tool. They see it as a form of reality and a desperate grasp to understand why they are on this earth.&nbsp;  Now, you may get pissed of at my viewpoint. I am not writing on here to piss people off. I just want to talk about things.  To me, my religion is more practical.&nbsp; My God is nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We have no purpose here on earth.&nbsp; We are random acts of chemicals. We are powered by a soul that is energy (electricity). When the energy dissapates, we die and return to our God aka nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We are put into this earth and we are gone. There is no heaven or hell. Just a transfer of energy into a never ending cycle. That cycle will only be broken if one of the energies&nbsp;or chemicals&nbsp;dissapates (sun, gravity, earth, oxygen).&nbsp;  Who each person is, is our nature. Chemicals and matter make up our individual personalities. Personalities and moods can be modified with outside chemicals whether they be illegal drugs or prescribed drugs.&nbsp; I am an example of this. My personality is modified with prescription drugs to make life seem more livable.&nbsp; If our personality is part of our soul, then we shouldn't have any capabilities of modifying who we are with chemicals.&nbsp;  Ghosts to me are natural phenomena when energy is displaced.&nbsp; It might be from a person that was on this earth, but that ghost does not inhabit the personality of the energy's past. Ghosts may be around us all the time. It might be something we electively see from time to time, if at all. When we see these ghosts, we might make them into an image we will understand such as a person we know whom has died.&nbsp; People instinctually force things into categories so they can bear to process the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also true that this very thought of ghosts debases the whole heaven and hell theory of Christianity.&nbsp; We can only have one and not the other. What is the answer?&nbsp; Who is right?&nbsp; When you try to make Christianity black and white, you can't. When you take my theory, it seems more plausable and easily transfers over into black and white. You can call my religion Panthiesm if you need the label.       "
"                 To everyone out there that discriminates, disrespects, and disbelieves mental illness should take the time to understand it first, then make a judgement call.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out in this world that take those mental illness labels and try to fit them into one tightly sealed 'container' filled with the same thing over and over again. People fail to realize those terms are blanketing terms that are very general and non specific to most of the characteristics of the illness. Because of the stigma of mental illness, most Americans after being diagnosed with one, tend to lie about it in the future because they are afraid.&nbsp; They are afraid of losing their jobs, friends, and family. They are afraid that they will be wrongly judged and called psycho or crazy behind their backs.&nbsp; They are afraid that no one will listen to them anymore or think what they say is valid or real. Some people think that mental illness is a joke and a trendy epidemic in America.&nbsp; Some people think that people with mental illness are better off dead.&nbsp; Do you know what I say to these people? FUCK YOU! I was diagnosed initially when i was 16 years old with clinical depression.&nbsp; When I hit 18, i was diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety.&nbsp; When I was 20 years old, I was diagnosed bipolar type two and general anxiety. The last diagnosis still stands to this day.&nbsp; A lot of people in this world will look right at me and start trashing someone with a mental illness of a similar label as mine. These people do not know I have those labels as well. I let these people talk, but it makes me steam because of the ignorance of what they are saying.&nbsp; Most people think that mental illness makes you crazy or disabled.&nbsp; My illness sometimes gives me creativity, vision, and the ability to see differently than others.&nbsp; It has made me who I am.&nbsp; Right now, I take medication. I only take it because&nbsp; if I dont, then I stop sleeping very well.&nbsp; I also take medication to make me less filled with stress and tension from&nbsp; being scared.&nbsp; The nature of my disorders are not extreme. They are so mild in nature. I have never been hospitalized or drugged up because I was going to hurt myself.&nbsp; The way a movie portrays mental illness does not help the stigma.&nbsp; You have out there 'Me, Myself, and Irene', 'Girl Interrupted', 'Secret Window', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'A Beautiful Mind', and countless others.&nbsp; They do not shed the light on the reality of what it is, but the extreme nature of what a person can go through if they have it. The majority of this world does not have it extremely bad. And most of those people are never treated.  I found this poem that I relate to. It really touched me and pointed out something about how society is concerning mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as follows.    To Be a Mental Patientby Rae Unzicker (1948-2001)   To be a mental patient is to be stigmatized, ostracized, socialized, patronized, psychiatrized.   To be a mental patient is to have everyone controlling your life but you. You're watched by your shrink, your social worker, your friends, your family.&nbsp; And then you're diagnosed as paranoid.  To be a mental patient is to live with the constant threat and possibility of being locked up at any time, for almost any reason.   To be a mental patient is to live on $82 a month in food stamps, which won't let you buy Kleenex to dry your tears.&nbsp; And to watch your shrink come back to his office from lunch, driving a Mercedes Benz.   To be a mental patient is to take drugs that dull your mind, deaden your senses, make you jitter and drool and then you take more drugs to lessen the 'side effects.'   To be a mental patient is to apply for jobs and lie about the last few months or years, because you've been in the hospital, and then you don't get the job anyway because you're a mental patient.&nbsp;  &nbsp;To be a mental patient is not to matter.   To be a mental patient is never to be taken seriously.   To be a mental patient is to be a resident of a ghetto, surrounded by other mental patients who are as scared and hungry and bored and broke as you are.   To be a mental patient is to watch TV and see how violent and dangerous and dumb and incompetent and crazy you are.   To be a mental patient is to be a statistic.   To be a mental patient is to wear a label, and that label never goes away, a label that says little about what you are and even less about who you are.   To be a mental patient is to never to say what you mean, but to sound like you mean what you say.   To be a mental patient is to tell your psychiatrist he's helping you, even if he is not.   To be a mental patient is to act glad when you're sad and calm when you're mad, and to always be 'appropriate.'   To be a mental patient is to participate in stupid groups that call themselves therapy.&nbsp; Music isn't music, its therapy; volleyball isn't sport, it's therapy; sewing is therapy; washing dishes is therapy.&nbsp; Even the air you breathe is therapy and that's called 'the milieu.'   To be a mental patient is not to die, even if you want to -- and not cry, and not hurt, and not be scared, and not be angry, and not be vulnerable, and not to laugh too loud -- because, if you do, you only prove that you are a mental patient even if you are not.  And so you become a no-thing, in a no-world, and you are not.  Rae Unzicker © 1984       "
"                 Ok, I have this awesome computer with a DVD burner +-. It is absolutely the most complex piece of machinery I have ever owned.&nbsp; You can't just copy DVDS. You have to decript them, then you can burn them with Nero. Problem being is you have to have all the correct settings in order for this to work. Also, If your movie needs subtitles, you can just forget about zipping something up to burn.&nbsp; It is a long and complicated process. My friend Jon was over last night working on it for 4 hours.&nbsp; Finally I was like, GO HOME! I am tired!&nbsp; I feel really sleepy today as a result.&nbsp; We didn't even figure out how to burn the subtitles either.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep for the night. Anyone know how to burn those DVD subtitles? I wish there was an all in one program to do this.&nbsp;        "
"                 I met Brian in January 2003. We started dating February 4, 2003.&nbsp; He is the longest boyfriend I have had that was not over a distance for some time. We started living together in October 2003.&nbsp; I love him very much. He is my friend, lover, and future husband (Hopefully).&nbsp; I do not want to have children and he does not pressure me to have them.&nbsp; We have our disagreements about something, but they have always seemed to work out. The only thing that hinders our relationship is the fact his parents hate me from the get go. They hate everyone. Brian is really hard up for their approval (which he will never get from anything he does) from them. We fight about his parents more than anything. He still has not told them we live together. He has not spoken to them in almost 7 months.&nbsp; It is a really long time not to speak to your family.&nbsp; I talk to my family about once a week.&nbsp; I think the fact that I wrote them a letter telling his parents how I feel and what they are doing really made Brian mad. Brian cannot stand up for himself&nbsp; or anyone to them. So I stood up for myself. I don't think I did anything wrong except putting things in writing instead of only calling them. Spoken words fade away.&nbsp; Written words people can dwell on their misery. I spoke the truth from my viewpoint.&nbsp; I tried straightening up what they thought about me, but they only made me cry and pushed me away. They are the most miserable people I have ever met in my entire life.&nbsp; Brian tends to get sucked into their misery and believes sometimes it is his fault.  Brian has a hard time with people.&nbsp; He always wants other people's approval for everything.&nbsp; He struggles with this on a daily basis. He suffocates what he really thinks so people will like him.&nbsp; There is a line you draw when it comes to people's approval.&nbsp; I think Brian is willing to cross the line sometimes.&nbsp; He becomes so concerned about what people think of me, that it is irritating. I don't care too much what people think. I have good and bad days and if someone catches me on a bad day, or if I do not like them, I do not hide my feelings.&nbsp; Brian has a hard time with this. He would rather me suck them all in and squash them as he does with his.&nbsp; I think Brian has a lot of growing up to do and a lot of hardening up as well. Brian has never had a job where his life depended on the money. He always had something to prevent that situation. He doesn't understand when I am tired because he can sleep however much he needs. He cannot understand me wanting to sit around because I am never home. He is always at home. He cannot understand that I am around people all the time and need my space. I think all this will change once he finally is completely on his own and working full time to pay off his debts from being in school.  Don't get me wrong, Brian is a wonderful person, but every wonderful person has their flaws.       "
"                 My new job is great.&nbsp; I stay busy most of the time. The only time I am not busy is on Fridays where no one is here. I have excellent benefits and excellent pay. I enjoy the work I do and I enjoy it when it is complete.&nbsp; I do not mind coming into work every day.&nbsp; I sit right behind my friend Margaret. She is the one that helped me get this position.&nbsp; I have been here for almost a month now. Things couldn't be better.  One thing about this job is I feel it has separated me from my friend Deborah, from my old job. All I can really say is my life is great now, and hers isn't. Her misery does not rub off on me anymore.&nbsp; I think it takes away from some of the common ground we had together. It is tough not to feel like I am bragging about my job when she is around.&nbsp; I do not have any major gripes like I used to with the old position. Misery loves company, and now I am not good company to her.&nbsp; I think she is one of those people that is addicted to misery.&nbsp;  My job is kinda interesting. It can be called a more complex version of Data entry and customer service.&nbsp; I administer a program along with a process that people use to publish new projects.&nbsp; Eventually I will be involved in process improvement.  VW does tuition reimbursement. I am going to go back to school in the Winter for my Masters of Science in Business Information Technology.&nbsp; Hopefully that will put me in line for management positions at VW.  This company is the kind of company I could work for, forever. One condition is that I get better positions as the years pass. Right now VW&nbsp; is ranked 88th best IT place to work in the country voted by ComputerWorld Magazine.  One of the cool benefits is I get is a discount on a vehicle. I am going to lease, and when you lease, they pay for your car insurance.&nbsp; Right now my car is a dump and I cannot wait to get my convertible VW Beetle.&nbsp; I currently have a Beetle, but I have had it for 5 years and it is turning into a pile of junk.  I feel that VW takes care of their employees very well. I feel that they are fair, just employers and I don't think they would allow the things that happend at my old company to occur here. I recommend this place. Its essentially the best place I have worked in my entire life.         "
"                  I have four cats because.... I am insane?&nbsp; no.... Because I wanted them? partially.&nbsp; Ok here is the story.&nbsp; I have 4 cats because of one cat and a boyfriend who don't get along.&nbsp; Somehow along the way, my precious Winter became terrified of my boyfriend, Brian, after we moved in together.&nbsp; He started shitting in places he wasn't suppose to as well as peeing. It got in his fur, in my closet etc. It made my life hell for 3 months. I had to lock Winter up in a cage.&nbsp; Me and Brian moved into a 2 bedroom apartment in February. Winter got his own room. Winter was still terrified and doing all those bad things even though he could hear Brian but couldn't see him.&nbsp; So, I thought that getting another cat would help.&nbsp; Well, I couldn't find a place who would not call my Landlord about having another cat. So I went to the vet and they were selling 2 cats for the price of one. They were littermates and just under a year old.&nbsp; I took them because I wanted something and if this is all I could get, I would take it.&nbsp;    Winter got immediately better.&nbsp; Brian's attitude towards cats improved by 100%.&nbsp; Then a few months later, I got an email from a friend saying he knew someone who wanted to get rid of their black persian.&nbsp; I couldn't resist since a black persian was my dream cat.&nbsp; Now I have Winter, Midnight, Jasmine and Jayma.&nbsp; My least favorite is Jayma because she beats up the cats to the point where she is vicious. She breaks things and shreds on things. She begs for food all the time.&nbsp; She is annoying. I wouldn't mind getting rid of her.&nbsp; The two kittens are compulsive over eaters.&nbsp; They eat so much that I had to have set feeding times for them. When they don't have food to eat, they like to eat things that are not food and they chew on wires.&nbsp; It is annoying. They are extremely obese. My two persians, Winter and Midnight, are so precious. They play together and have fun. They are so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I really love those two cats alot.&nbsp; I would be torn up if anything ever happend to them.    So that is the story of why I have 4 cats instead of just two.&nbsp;          "
"                 This is the first use of my new Blog. I hope it is as entertaining as it is thought provoking as I want it to be.&nbsp; I guess I can give a little background information about myself. My name is Breanne. I am 23 years old. I live with my boyfriend, 4 cats, and 1&nbsp;scared beta fish. I just started a month ago at my current job. I work in the Information Technology field. I waited long and hard for a position in IT.    I graduated from&nbsp;college in November of 2002 with a BA. in Computer Information Systems.&nbsp; I tried my hardest from August 2002 to December 2002 to get any permenant job.&nbsp; I had to give up and go to temping. From there is where I worked at several places including the place I am a permanent employee now. I was at VW as a temp then had to leave because they wouldn't hire me perm. I went off to Sho-Link.&nbsp; Who would of thought it would go from bad to much much worse. I never knew a 'Dilbert' office or an 'Office Space' office really would exist.&nbsp;  There I encountered all the things that made a bad business. There was nepotism, favortism, shovanism, sexual harrassment, drug usage, and just plain stupid people.  My first day, I met everyone. I went in there thinking everything will be good and fine.&nbsp; My first day wanted to send me running. They smoked in the office, causing me to get migranes all week. They did take me out to lunch the first two days but the rest of the week I ate alone and from that point on I ate alone because they didn't want me in their clique (3 people were really clique). This girl, Deborah, was the administrative assistant.&nbsp; She seemed loud, angry, and repressed. After me and her were left there at the end of the day while all the higher up people got to leave before 8 hrs was up, she would sit with me and bitch about how horrible the company was. She told me past stories of things that absolutely struck fear into my heart.&nbsp; I would often go home&nbsp; and cry.&nbsp; Her misery spread into my misery.&nbsp; My misery over the next 10 months turned into my own misery, a reality that I couldn't bear.  Jenny, my supervisor, was the dumb blonde that always laughed at what you said yet when you complained, she would brush you off.&nbsp; She talked incessantly about herself and would completely tune out others while she went on and on.&nbsp; All you really had to do was knod and say yes every once in awhile.&nbsp; I started avoiding her after 3 months.&nbsp; Every once in awhile she would corner me in my office and make me talk about something about herself that I didn't give a rats ass about.&nbsp; She didn't give a rats ass about me, so I could hardly care for her.&nbsp;  While I was there I got really sick.&nbsp; The pressures of having to be at the office 40 hrs a week with no leeway was too much. I had a rough February with moving into a new apartment. They weren't particularly fond of anyone taking off work and would talk trash about the person if they were gone.&nbsp; It made me reluctant to be gone. It made me want to be around so they wouldn't gang up on me behind my back.&nbsp; I also attempted to ask if I could leave 30 minutes early for two months so I could take a class, and they said no. I couldn't believe&nbsp;Jenny.&nbsp; Her excuse is she has an office to run, but she is never there.&nbsp; Also, 30 minutes isn't asking for much.&nbsp; At that point, I loathed her.&nbsp; I was determined to leave Sho-Link at this point.  At Sho-Link, I was a CS Rep. There was a girl,&nbsp;Shannon,&nbsp;that had my position before me that worked at one of the other companies we did business with. Ironically enough, not only did they attempt to fire this girl in the past, but recommended her to the other company, Derse.&nbsp; This girl hated me instantly because I had her old position. She tried to make my life hell at that company. And it worked. She got exactly the reaction from Jenny and the president, Alan that she wanted.&nbsp; She constantly was trying to get me in trouble. It first started with her stating I did an order wrong that cost them tons of money. I ended up proving her wrong. Another mistake is one time she called 15 til 5pm and I said, Oh I turned off my computer. Let me turn it back on.&nbsp; That next day I got 'disiplined' by my supervisor, Jenny.&nbsp; I couldn't believe they were making this such a big deal. The things that girl got away with when she worked here were far greater than turning off a computer a little early.&nbsp; She would stretch the truth about me always. She told them I turned off my computer an hour early. It was quite ridiculous. She couldn't prove anything, but I could because Deborah was there.  Another instance with this girl, Shannon was she came to an office baby shower uninvited.&nbsp; Everyone felt really uncomfortable. When she left the room, I said she makes me feel uncomfortable to the VP, Scott.&nbsp; He took this comment, told the president, Alan, and the whole office got in trouble for it.&nbsp; I thought it was insane that everyone got in trouble over that. I had a right to say how I felt in a non-insulting manner.&nbsp; After all the things she had done to me, I had a right to feel SOMETHING.&nbsp;  Sho-Link has a end of the year party every year(its really a Christmas Party). Me and my boyfriend went. My boyfriend that night got totally tanked. While he was dancing with me, he slammed his head into mine, cutting open his skin above his eye.&nbsp; We had to rush him to the emergency room. The VP, Scott, took us there. My boyfriend was puking everywhere and crying. I ended up taking him back to the hotel and I left him for a few minutes. I went up to the Presidents room where they were having a party.&nbsp; Alan attempted to take a cleevage shot of my breasts.&nbsp; I left the room.&nbsp; I was already humiliated enough.&nbsp; I ended up staying up all night cleaning up Brian's vomit.&nbsp; I wanted to never see those people again.&nbsp; When I went to work that next week, they laughed and teased me about it. They said something happens to someone every year. My opinion of the majority of these people was not a good one.&nbsp; I didn't feel any better being compared to someone else at that company.  While I was there, I slowly became good friends with Deborah and Carrie.&nbsp; Deb more than Carrie though.&nbsp; Deborah was really fun to be around.&nbsp; She was smart, inteligent, deligent, and on her way to becoming successful.&nbsp; I clung to her for the only intelligent conversation and common interests we had outside of work.&nbsp; Carrie and I shared an office and became friends in a way that made me learn a lot from her.&nbsp; She made me laugh and was fun to be around.&nbsp; She would talk about anything.  In&nbsp;March of 2004, I received a call from my old friend Margaret at VW. She said they were going to have an open position in her area and I could do that job. She asked if I was interested. I said yes. I wanted out. I never thought it was going to happen. Two months trickled by without a word from anyone. Finally, while searching Monster.com, I saw my job on there!&nbsp; I was outraged, upset, disturbed, and sad.&nbsp; I was passed up again!&nbsp; So, I applied again anyway.&nbsp; A few more weeks goes by and I get called in for an interview.&nbsp; I was nearly jumping out of my skin for weeks. I was so excited. I went to the interview and it was awesome. I did better at that interview than any other one in the past. I was not even nervous.&nbsp; I thought for sure I had this one.&nbsp; At the end of the week, I received a call offering me the job. I was stoked!&nbsp; I put in my two weeks notice the following Monday and here I am.&nbsp; I work at VW&nbsp; in the field of MY CHOICE.          "
"                 I have come to realize how most of me, is inside my head. I think more internally and hardly ever vocalize what I am thinking. I think what if, if then, type scenarios, act them out in my head and come to a conclusion to what will happen. I realized this because me and Brian were at his friends house and everyone was talking.  I kept dazing off and people wandered what I was thinking.  Most of the time I do not realize I am psycho analyzing a situation until I really stopped to think about it(once again).  It helped me realize who I am more.  I realize now why I am not very articulate.  I am so used to explaining ideas in my head, that I have no practice telling someone else these things, because I miss telling all the links that brought me to the conclusion. I definitely need to work on this attribute because I need to be better at articulating my thoughts at work.  I need to fine tune my words of persuasion and speaking in complete thought processes.  I internalize so much, that I never really realized this part of me. I just expect people to fill in the gaps naturally.  What is so weird is, when I go into myself, it is like the outside of me shuts off and I look blank or angry or sad, when really, I am just somewhere else completely.       "
"                 I do not know what is with me lately, but everything smells horrible.  I wonder if this is normal. People's body odor, breath, etc are driving me crazy. The smell of skin even. Kinda weird. I also think I imagine some smells.  For example, sometimes when I have gone down on a guy, I think i smell urine or like old cum on them.  It kinda grosses me out.  And I feel like my sensitivity to smell right now is turning me into an ice queen.  Ever notice  how awful sex smells? Ugh, I cannot stand the way it smells. Also, the room that I sleep in smells bad. Me and my boyfriend open a window and it does not help. It has permeated the room. The sheets even smell bad from it along with my boyfriend's clothes that are in there.  It seems like smells are so intense lately. Maybe it is hormonal. Maybe it is because I have all these smelly litter boxes everywhere, so I am constantly bombarded with a horrible smell. Or the fact that my boyfriend doesn't take out the trash enough, so the trash starts smelling.  Maybe it is the fact that my boyfriend also likes to dump food down a drain, and it starts smelling like rot.  Constant exposure to horrible things has probably gotten me oversensitive. You would think I wouldn't smell it after awhile. One time my friend came over and his feet smelled. I felt like it was so strong, I made him bathe his feet.  I couldn't believe I did that. How rude can I get??  LOL.       "
"                 This weekend was pretty good. Me and Brian had random fights as always. And as always he likes to categorize and assume I will do things because I have done things that way in the past.  It is really frustrating to always be put into the negative that way. His assumptions are negative always.  He never says a good assumption.  He can pretty much give me attitude about everything then reflect how I did something wrong in his eyes, drawing away the critical point of it all. For example: Korn has been calling you way too much dont you think Brian? Reply: Well I only answered because YOU were in your room and I didnt have anything better to do since you were in your room. I was bored.  (AKA my fault).  This stuff gets to me. It irritates me.  At the time I brought this up, I was looking to buy a vacation for the two of us and I just got soured by the reception Brian gave me when I made a comment on how much Korn calls.  It was such a turn off.  But otherwise I had fun. I enjoyed the Symphony (of what little we got to hear since it started raining) and I enjoyed paddle boating (despite Brian's attempts to fill the evening with commentary because he felt uncomfortable in our silence).  People are so strange. We headed over to Christina's afterwards yesterday and when we are about to leave she says she wants us to come over next Saturday.  She gets interrupted, and i say well anyway what were you saying Christina?  She goes oh so you wont come over unless you hear what is going on? I say no, I just wanted you to finish what you had to say.  I hate all these verbal battles. It is such a turnoff.       "
"                 Today, me and Brian went and got photo's taken. It was really fun. The photographer accused me of practicing.  I honestly just like taking photos. Brian had fun too it seemed.  It was just so cool. Now I have photos to give to my parents and some to put on my desk.  Tonight we are going to the chicago symphony orchestra at Ravina.  We are going to have a picnic and stuff. It will be very romantic. We are celebrating our year and a half together.  It doesn't seem like it could possibly be this long that we been together. We go through alot. We deal with each other alot through many issues.  We are still together though. It amazes me too.  We never have broken up once in all the time we have been together. I guess things work out if it is right.       "

"       Do you rely on a 'good gut reaction' or that 'special feeling' when interviewing perspective employees? Are you confident that your new hires will be successful? Are you good at interviewing prospective employees?  When I talk with executives and ask if they are good at selecting successful employees, they often indicate they have (or have not) been lucky lately. It’s not a matter of luck any more than picking a $50,000 piece of capital equipment is a matter of luck.  Recruiting is should be based on planning, excellent interviewing skills, and due diligence.  The Interview Today we are dealing with sophisticated applicants, many of whom are better interviewees than you may be an interviewer. They may have their resume professionally prepared or use sophisticated word processors with spell checkers and grammar checkers. Additionally, there are books, computer programs, tapes and classes to prepare a resume’ and to develop the ability to mask unpleasant information.  How many times do you finish an interview feeling that you just sat through a rehearsed script. If this is happening, you are probably not digging deep enough to get through the practiced veneer of the interviewee. An interview should be more than a conversation but less than an inquisition. An interview is a listening process to ferret out specific information to make a decision to hire or not hire.  If you are doing more than 40% of the talking you are not spending enough time listening. Furthermore, you should not be silently formulating the next question while the interviewee answers your previous question. When this happens, you’ve stopped listening.  In a naturally flowing interview, the candidate often telegraphs a weakness or an area to question. Follow your natural instincts when interacting with candidates. If something does not make sense, ask the candidate to clarify their statement and be sure to ask follow-up questions.  Another area be aware of is when a candidate says starts down a logic path and then reverses themselves or corrects a misstatement. When this happens; he or she is often making an effort to restate the practiced response. Go back to the original idea to determine which is the accurate answer.  If the candidate uses terms such as, 'we,' or 'they' or refers to a group or team, find out who was in the group, and what specifically was their role.  Be aware of body language. If their hands are clutched and they have white knuckles, if they suddenly lean back after you ask a question, if they are evasive, this may be a 'trouble' spot, so pursue the issue. There is probably is information in that area that you will want to know.  Questions As interviewers, we all have been advised to ask open ended questions such as 'tell me how you would manage the sales process.' Open-ended questions, which deal in hypothetical situations, are theory questions. It may be more beneficial to ask open-ended behavioral questions, especially if the individual is an experienced interviewee. For example, How did you ..., What happened when..., How did you get ...., When were (weren’t) you ...., With a practiced interviewee, it is important to move from the theoretical to the behavioral line of questions.  An experienced interviewer listens to the candidate’s answers and asked the follow-on questions, who, what, where, when, why. tell me more about ... , etc.  Checking References -- Due Diligence If you have come this far, conduct a thorough reference check. When checking references do not go to personnel or payroll. Try to talk to the individual’s supervisor. Ask for information about performance, interpersonal relations, ability, motivation, attendance as well as dates, titles and compensation. Listen carefully and if necessary push a little in order to get complete information. Often, you will learn something that will either solidify your decision or knock the candidate out of contention. Sometimes you will only be told the basics but even that information has value. Remember that when selecting an employee your organization’ reputation, sales goals, products, and financial well being are at stake. Proceed with caution. A human asset doesn’t come with a guarantee and may turn around and sue you.  Planning means that a position’s requirements and responsibilities should be well thought out, not a string of broad generalizations. Recently, while discussing a search assignment in financial services, I was told the requirements for the sales position was 'a person with a friendly personality, good quantitative skills and a solid work ethic.' I suggested that they needed to be more specific. Otherwise, with those requirements, half the applicants we see would probably qualify.  Before beginning the interview process, set up a grid of 'Musts' and 'Wants' like the one below. Write down the requirements, skills, responsibilities and standards for success. It you cannot complete this step you should not begin interviewing. Go back and rethink the position and its composition. Clear-up requirements, reporting relationships, responsibilities and standards for success. Uncertainty on critical points may cause you to lose good candidates and probably result in hiring the wrong candidate.  FACTORS MUSTS(Go -- No Go Decision) WANTS(Nice to Have) Knowledge     Experience     Personal Traits     Standards of Success     Hopefully the interviews will identify a candidate that can, and will do the job. If the process is positive end the interview with some sales presentation about the pluses of working for the company. Provide positive feedback to keep the candidate interested until a decision or offer can be made and references checked.     "
"       Some employers seem to go out of their way to lose the best employees they have. It is always the best employees who leave first as they have the most options. The employer is left with the least talented, least creative employees, the folks reluctant to take risks.  So how do employers accomplish this sort of an exodus?  * Hire your friends and family. This makes it clear to all employees that there is not an even playing field. Get close to the boss...and advancement is yours. It creates a climate of favoritism and brown nosing, which results in management being told what they want to hear. HINT: Any family or friends that are employed should not have a direct reporting relationship. They should compete like anyone else for the job and advancement.  * Don't allow any flexibility. In employee surveys, flexibility in schedules and time off are identified as more important than wages. Caught between raising children and caring for elderly parents, today's employees are sandwiched between conflicting demands. HINT: Make flexibility a priority. Focus on supporting the employee rather than policing the policies.  * Don't replace employees that leave...simply spread the work among remaining staff. Think of the immediate cost savings while staff becomes demoralized. People want to feel successful at work, not set up for failure. HINT: It takes years to undo a negative perception as an employer. Do not sacrifice employee retention for short-term gain.  * Compare staff members. Whether publicly or privately, comparison means someone always comes up short. Comparisons tend to demoralize and discourage and promote competition rather than cooperation. Cooperation is essential to build teams and create a learning organization. HINT: Never compliment one person at the expense of another. Don't engage in workplace gossip.  * Use praise instead of encouragement. What's the difference? PLENTY. Praise is given for a job completed. A job well done. Encouragement is given for effort or improvement. The problem with praise is it is often given only to those who need it the least. While there can be rewards for stellar performance, in a learning organization, more attention should be given to efforts across the organization. HINT: Establish systems that reward efforts and new ideas with a focus on improvement.  * Micro-manage all staff activities. Few things disempower staff like a boss who hovers over their shoulders questioning every move and managing each decision. The message is clear-'I have no confidence in your abilities.' Staff feels discouraged and loses creativity. It is important to remember that there is more than one right way to do things. HINT: Hire good people, and then get out of their way.  * Leave job descriptions vague and uncertain. Similar to embarking on a major journey without a map, expecting great performance by 'winging it' doesn't work. People tend to live up to the expectations given to them. HINT: Make job descriptions detailed and specific. Meet regularly with staff to discuss progress and encourage improvement.  * Give feedback only when there is a problem. The employee learns quickly that there is little recognition of what they do 'right.' The boss will be viewed as nitpicking and critical when they hear only the negatives. HINT: Meet with employees regularly to give positive feedback and encourage improvement.To keep the best employees in today's job market, the employee must be treated as a key customer. Make employee retention and development a top priority.     "
"       Relations......  These days, we are speaking aboutInternational Relations, Customer Relations, ClientRelations, Employee Relations and in fact, Across theBorder Relations. All, the above relations aremonetary in nature and none of them is without anypurpose.  The philosophy is very simple, Give and Take.In the process, we are forgetting/ignoring ourpersonal relations, family relations and General HumanRelations, relations, which are based on values, love,affection and care.  You may call it as an influence of western culture orlack of time or self-fish nature of a person...we approach or remember our friends, relatives andsometimes even our parents...only at the time of need.There is no trust, no faith, no believe, no loyaltyand no love in relations.   Generally, whenever I extendmy hand for friendship, I face two types of queries from other people.  1)I don't know anything about you I am not interested? True, I don't know anything about you but does that stop you or me to know about each other. Relations,need time...in fact quality time.  2)What do you want from me? This is because, we knowthat nothing comes free and if some one is approaching you, it is only for some purpose. We believe that noone will be approaching you, without anypurpose...there is no self less relation. Probably yes, but I can assure you that I don't need you oryour help, I like to know about you, your values, yourbelieves, to understand you as a person...andprobably, I may be able to help you...sometimes...downin my life time.  I believe in two things:  1)Learning from other's experience  2)Every Person is Different  A child is born with numerous relations'...relations of parents, grandparents, relatives and what not. Why we are so poor in maintaining our relations? We are selfish, we are opportunistic, we never feel happy inthe happiness of others, we never celebrate otherssuccess and most importantly, we have doublestandards.  It is pathetic to know and read news like,' Son murdering his mother or a father raping his daughter', these are the foundation of any relation...and if that foundation itself is so weak,what can we expect from other relations. Where are those values and culture, we are so proud off?  The question is very simple, if you are not able to maintain your relations with your parents, your children, your relatives and yourfriends, which are lesser in number and known to you;how are you going to maintain your relations with employees, which are larger in number and not known to you?

"       1. Protect Your Investment : The HR team must come down hard on managers who consistently drive away good talent or who inadequately prepare new recruits for the job ahead.  2. Re-recruit Your Best People Call frequent reviews and conferences with employees to determine when, where, and how HR can induce star talent to stay on board.  3. Heed the Big Three: Contribution, Growth, and Fun Measure your talent according to these three keywords. People are most likely to quit jobs that fail to offer stimulating projects that encourage personal development.  4. Web-ify Your Recruiting Process: Leverage the power of the Web by building and fostering a digital gateway where candidates can learn about the company, chat online with employees, and email the appropriate representatives with questions, comments, and resumes.  5. Sell Your Culture: Talk to the candidates, bring in employees who have left the company and come back, hire a marketing firm to specifically sell the company brand and personality to prospective candidates.  6. Think Outside the normal modes of recruitment : Rather than simply post a job online, think creatively about referral incentives for employees and other alternative models for finding and attracting the top talent.  7. Detox bad policies -- such as inflexible work schedules and stringent dress codes -- before they poison the corporate culture and turn away potential candidates.  8. KISS principle : 'Spell It Out'! Communicate the rules clearly and openly, but don't hesitate to rewrite them as needed. Small, thoughtful changes can have an enormous impact on morale and retention.  9. Demand Pre-Exit Interviews Speak with employees before they submit two weeks' notice. These interviews, based on trust and integrity, may help an unhappy employee and affect overall recruiting and retaining strategies.  10. Blame Yourself:  'Start with the premise that you are a crappy manager, and that's why your people are leaving!' 'Treat your employees as resources for improving your performance and the performance of the company.'     "
"       Yesterday I was quite clear about my life and where I was heading, had put the lid on my previous relationship and was set to move forward.   But hten, there was the major change which happend this morning...I had a chat with him..it was hearbreaking, I thought I would get some closure on stuff..but instead it opened up my wounds and fears.  I dont know if its a case that he is playing on my fears or I played on my fears which is why I have got here or what!  He was short of begging and pleading with me, what did I do to get this! My life is torn up so badly where I have my parents on one side and him on the other.  My parents have done everything for me, cant I sacrfice this atleast for them?  God bought me onto this planet to be their guide in their old age and be their treasure.    Yes, I am in pain, I am confused, can this ever be fixed, or do I stand to lose my best friend in life..the same person with whom I had planned everything from the look of our bedroom to our kids names!  This aint going to help me or anyone else...I have to take a decision..and I dont think I have the choice here, I have select my parents, coz they have given me a lot more than I can ever think about!

"       This saturday was quite a different one compared to my old saturdays, no slogging it out at work, sat at home and relaxed out. &nbsp; Started the day out with one heavy duty circuit workout at the gym and followed it with a nice hot water bath..man, the hot man believe me helps to soothe those muscles up!&nbsp; Then I decided, its time to start to pick up some of the old pieces of my life...yes, my painting.&nbsp; Had about 2 paintings overdue and 3 orders, so it was high time I put my ass on the line and completed it.&nbsp; So after slogging it out for 4 hours thro the afternoon, I finally took a break and decided to listen to some of my old cds.&nbsp; Hardly had an idea as to what I was playing, put pushed in the cd, closed the room door, lay on the ground and allowed the music to take over my senses. &nbsp; Gosh, I seriously dont know how I picked this particular CD....the songs were a little on the older side, most of my favorites which I had compiled over a little more than a year ago.&nbsp; The songs sure did haunt me.....too apt for my current state of&nbsp; mind... &nbsp; Toni Braxton - Unbreak my heart, Spanish Guitar &amp; Breathe Again Eric Chalpton - Tears in Heaven Wet Wet Wet - Love is all around Daniel Bedingfield - If you are not the one Wham - Last Christmas Madonna - Say good bye Celine Dion - Power of Love Seal - Kiss from a rose Phil Collins - Another day in paradise Take that - Nobody else OST Alladin&nbsp;&nbsp;- Its a whole new world OST Lion King- Circle of Life OST Dirty Dancing - I've Had the time of my life Bed &amp; Breakfast - If you were mine &nbsp; Gosh...these songs seriously messed with my emotional status today.&nbsp; I dont know, but everytime I seem to be urging myself to move a step forward, there is something from yester years which pulls me into a different mode altogether and I go on this...'what if things were so' routine!&nbsp; This is seriously painful for me, but then I guess its' something I have to go thro' and I know others too would be going thro the same....I'm not alone in this! &nbsp; Anyway, towards the late evening, I decided enough is enuogh of my weird routine and I pleaded with my parents and went for a drive.&nbsp; This drive though took me to a 108 Divya desam place called Thiruvinanur.&nbsp; Nice quaint temple near Chennai, about one hour's drive, that too mainly becoz of the traffic!&nbsp; Sat there in the temple for about 40 minutes, had a good dharshan and got back home at 9.&nbsp; Now I am quite tired..had a long chat with my friend and discussed life and it's wonders with him....was quite ironical, esp with him, coz over a year ago I was kindof in a situation where I was advising him on his love life, decisions which needed to be taken, why it had to be taken etc...and now I was in a situation where my personal and professional life is kindof a mess and I have little or no energy to figure my way out...am quite like in a maze right now....heres' hoping I find a way thro' this maze called life!&nbsp; Cheers! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          "
"       Today was a serious case of nostalgia.&nbsp; Kept a bet with my boss this morning that I will find a way by which I will be able to set up an online survery tool which allows direct polling.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As I began the quest for the same, I was remembered of my days at my previous office.&nbsp; Those days when I used to sit for hours together and work with him and set up the intranet and then the online survey system.&nbsp; Cant forget the day when we founda bug and spent over 3 hours trying to find the error..gave up and later I found out that we had made an error in the setup.&nbsp; Quite a funny error which we made, but then the final product was a major success.&nbsp; Something I guess my previous office is now utilizing to the maximum ( thats ofcourse if they have the brains to understand its purpose...).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway...so began my quest to figure out a survey program today.&nbsp; Sat for 2 hours this morning, couldnt find a single program to meet my expectations...guess I had too high ones coz of the last one which I set up at my previous office...no Idea. During the process I bumped into the software in PhP ESP easy software.&nbsp; Man, all the work which we did in setting this up, the ridiculous statements ppl made when we ventured out on this, etc...man, what memories.&nbsp; Had a look at the demo and thought how nice it would have been had I got some idea as to how to set this thing up.&nbsp; No one around here understands the meaning of PHP itself...quite sad...but then I guess thats something one will need to live with here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat going thro the demo, all I could see was the work we did to fix the survey, get this moving...and there I lost all hope of figuring out how to install this....Man, I would need to learn PHP itself to figure this one out... &nbsp; So I guess my search for another software for survey management will now begin again....wonder if there would be anything to meet my expectations....????

"       Today was on tragic day in my life....finally the curtains had to draw a close on this show and the next show had to take over.  Sad, yes it is, but when considering the odds of an extension or a re run, haha, it was getting to be a comedy of errors.  As life treats me with an iron rod and I begin my journey towards the new horizon, I have learnt a few lessons...and have learnt it the really hard way...  1.  Never trust ppl....yes, I had said this before....but then there was someone who stole this principle from me and I had to share and then also put this on the back burner.....trust none, coz that gives you extreme pain and misery.  One day you will be happy and the next day you will feel like garbage!  2.  Pack your emotions aside...yes, me the romantic and ever open yourself up person is saying this.  Never allow your emotions to rule you, always rule over your emotions. Emotions just kill you and choke the daylights out of you.  Before you know you will find yourself in the morgue of misery, counting each of the moments you gave into your emotions and wrecked your peace and sanity!  3.  Extreme care with words...This has always been a principle with me, have never let myself down with this and never intend to ever do so too!  Always give one answer for 4 questions, never say something too nice or too harsh to ppl, coz they will twist it around and make you look like an absolute idiot.  4.  Never allow ppl to say ' dont think about I first '....always think about I...I is important, never let yourself down. The minute you let yourself down you are assured of one thing, ppl will treat you like a door mat and slam you across the floor with zero mercy!  5.  Never be nice to ppl...Ppl always mistake niceity and at the end of the day, you will find yourself mopping your own tears. People will care for you till they get what they want, the minute they have achieved that you are useless material and they forget about your existence!  All these things are really hard to say...but believe me..after I went thro a rollacoaster today..I have learn tthigns the hard and very bitter way...GOD SAVE ME...pls....take away this misery...take away this pain...I cant take this anyone...why so much hate and misery in my life..what did I do to deserve this!   I dont know if I will ever get answers for these questions...but I do know one thing....this pain will teach me a bitter lesson for life and I will never ever make these mistakes again...and if I do...I think I will rest assure myself, that will be the last time I write a blog in my life!         "
"       This is something I had on my Website..and has made a huge impact in quite a few of my friends lives..coz they used this to decide whether or not they were in love...  Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? Then it's love.  Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? Then it's love.  Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's love.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there? Then it's love.  Do you accept their faults because they're a part of who they are? Then it's love.  Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret?Then it's love.   Would you allow them to leave you, not because they want to but because they have to? Then its love.  Would you give them your heart, your life, your death? Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why? The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE. It is such an addiction that even people who are not having it wish to experience and share it with .            "
"       Last night was a major pain for me, the weather was too good and I thought I would be a pleasant night for me.  Haha...so much for that thought, coz it was anything but that!  The muggy weather coupled with a feeling of emptiness overtook me last night.  All I did was watch the ceiling for about 2 hours and then I guess the feeling of emptiness overtook me and I feel asleep.  Hardly 3 hours later I woke up again to the splatter of the rain on the window pane.  What a beautiful sight, complete black and empty all around and only the moon kissing against the stars and the smell of wet sand overtaking my senses.  Watching this sight for a few minutes and I could only remember the time when I had gone for a drive down the ECR, it was raining heavily, so the car had to pull over for a while and wait.  It was so pleasant to see the rain splatter onto the wind shield and run down the same. The clean green leaves and the swaying trees in the rain...gosh, still remember that sight as it was yesterday.    Once again, sleep over powered me and I slept for 1 hour this time, only to be woken up by the noises of the bed creaking.  Woke up at 4am this morning....loitered around the house and finally gave up trying to sleep for that night.  Got ready for the gym at 5am and then went and spend some time with my grandparents.  Different feeling to spend time with them in the morning...fresh and easy. Began my walk to the gym this morning, was quite a pleasant feeling,clear and crisp air blew past me and the heaviness began to lift up and out of my system.  Once I got to the gym, things became a lot better, worked out real hard....gosh, the pains of overweight!  Was feeling a  little low before getting to office this morning, dad wasnt around in town today to talk to,and mom aint really ready to listen to my blabber.  So just had to lock my thoughts away, keep a smile and head to office.  Office has been quite depressing so far....quality issues are bobbing me down big time and the feeling of emptiness is now starting to grow back into my system.  Pre Jan 03,my life was perfect, not a level of commitment, unhappiness, anger, etc to deal with and now its a pack of emotions rolled into a jigsaw puzzle which seems to have enough of pieces missing!  When will I find the missing pieces????  I wish I had some idea about this...:(         "
"       Today I did a little research on what makes a relationship tick....  1.  Trust : Without this there is nothing called a relation between two people. Trust emcompasses 'us'.  2.  Belief : This is not blind belief but a belief which comes out of understanding the person to the extent that there should not be a reason for the other partner to even wonder if there is an underlying meaning to something and takes things at face value.  3.  Ego : If there is an ego in any relationship between two people, only one thing can be a sure thing in this....the relationship is heading straight down the drain.  In a relationship, the mere thought of an ego cannot exist and one needs to bare their soul to the other person.  One can never think in terms of 'I', every thought has to be 'us' or 'we'!  4.  Boundaries : Boundaries fix the end point of your relationship.  Love is boundless, so by putting a boundary for the same or a timeline, one would be curtailing their feelings and allowing time to take a precedence over love.  5.  Past : Past plays a very important role in any relationship.  One needs to make peace with their past before moving to any other relationship.  Without accepting one's past, one always carries the baggage forward and messed the forthcoming relationships.  Then comes the comparision factor, which wrecks any relationship.  Each case is as unique as a finger print.  Comparision will only bring to light the strains of the past.  6.  Time out/ Breaks : This can be a plus as well as a minus in a relationship.  Minus in the sense that people make misuse this time to check out other options and then take a call on the current relationship.  This in reality does not help, but infact confuses the situation and adds a new dimension to ones' already confused mind and soul!  The plus of taking a break/ break, allows one to take a step back and understand the beauty of the relationship.  One never understands the beauty of a relationship while in it, its only when one takes a step back/ out and looks at things from an outsider perspective does one feel ready to accept the pitfalls and the compromises both partners have made towards the relationship.  7.  Coaching : As strange as it may sound, coaching is an essential part of a relationship.  Without the process of continous learning in the relationship, the excitement in the relationship is lost and what one has is just two people trying to cling onto each other because they are not prepared to let go and give each other space to understand themselves and their partner.  Coaching becomes extremely important in a relationship especially when the relationship is moving through a period of turbulence.  It is in period of turbulence that one should not take a decision to step away from the situation, but instead try to guide the other person to the shores close by.  This process of marooning a person in the time of need, infact turns out to be the first steps of moving away from the partner. The relationship needs to be given the time and space to grow, after all its' like a baby which needs to sit up, then have a steady head, then turn over, then crawl, stand, walk, etc.  Each step has an unique joy and moving thro' each level is what brings the two people together.  8.  Anger & Aggression : When one is trying to work towards building a relationship, being aggressive and trying to force an issue will never help.  There is a saying, 'time and tide waits for none', exactly on those lines, when one tries to shift gears in a relationship before it is ready to move to the next level, the relationship heads no where, and infact move down a gear in reality.  Controlled aggression is the way to building a relationship.  Anger will never help in exhausting the pain, its only sweet words or atleast words said in a diplomatic manner which will help.  A person blinded by anger never gets to understand the true meaning of ones' thoughts, and as result never conveys the meaning which is actually intended.  As a result, all the good thoughts and intentions, goes down the drain!  9.  Commitment & Consistency : This is an important key to unlock the box of happiness in any relationship.  Once this is broken, there is not a locksmith in the world which can find a key to match that particular lock.  Unflinching commitment, even in the worst of the circumstances is what gives belief to one's partner and more than anything makes one's partner actually show more love and affection towards them.  One has to stay consistent in a relationship.  In a relationship between two people where there is no blood relationship, its the words and actions which bind the two people together.   Words and actions once executed will always leave their scars on a relationship, atleast in the subconscious mind.  10.  Respect : The most important aspect of any relationship is the respect which the concerned have for each other.  Respect governs the heart and soul. Respect is the corner stone, once lost, takes a very long time to be earned!  I personally believe that relationship between two people who are not connected by a blood relationship is always a fragile one.  Without a good understanding of ones' partner on a deeper and not superficial level, the relationship has no binding at all.    Any building needs a strong foundation......no use of having the strongest pillars, best of the concrete, best of the architectural designs.......reinforcements will never help!           "
"       The last one week has been a bit of a revelation for me. For starters I began to understand a few things about myself, work, etc.  I began to come to peace with my life and the confusion I have been undergoing.  Yday I had a long chat with a close friend of mine, a person who had just begun the process of picking up the lost pieces in life and moving on.  Quite a strange chat with the person, coz we both we in kindof the same boat really.  But then we kindof had some level of commonality in all of that, the pain.  Yes, the pain was bad and it was touching new limits, but then is this pain really something which is paramount that we both make such a big issue over.  Yes, emotional attachment is tough to handle, but is this as bad as a loss of a blood relation with whom you have spent a lifetime with?  For the last two days, I have been doing quite a bit of thinking on this, imagine the pain a parent goes thro on losing their child, their treasure given by god.  Is that pain really anytime to compare with a bond which is created by destiny for whatsoever the purpose which brings together two individuals from different backgrounds?  Its just an emotional commitment in this case, yes, it is deep but is this as deep as that of a blood relation?    What pain a mother who has a baby growing in her will feel if she loses the child at any stage of the pregancy?  I can hardly imagine the devastation she would go thro in this, it could be quite blinding.  Comparing that, is there really any pain in what we are going thro over a relationship which has lasted just a few months or years?    How does one really understand the importance of their relationship?  Well, its not something which will come out of material aspects but the immaterial aspects only of the relationship.  The amount of immaterial aspects one sows in the relationship is what makes the relationship a sound one. Relationship has no strings attached to it, coz the bond of a true relationship runs much much much better, so deep that one can only say, there is a connection, but cannot say what really bind them together.  It is an unwritten bond between two people which defines a relationship, their belief and trust stands are two pillars in this, without either of this ,one has no right to even call the relationship by that name...coz it is actually minus those aspects and it becomes an agreement.    Life is defined by relationships...some with names, some without....which matters, when it matters, what love and affection comes from where...quite a weird thing to define...but one thing is for sure..if you are in a relationship and you want to test the nature of your relationship...take a step back...and take an outsider perspective of things, thats where you will understand what is the nature of your relationship.  One always needs a reality dose when it comes to relationships, so no use not accepting the faults on the relationship. life is all about relationships, the more you understand them, the better and stronger relationships you get urselves into.

"       So far thursday has been an interesting day.&nbsp; Its kindof been a mixed bag really...  First the bad stuff...my body ache is starting to climb on me again, and the idiotic stomach prob aint settling, so the medicines have to continue..boohoo...hate that stuff, coz its killing my appetite big time!&nbsp; Am just hoping that my body ache settles down so that my trip for the next three days doesnt get wrecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, the popping the pills session will need to go on for a while...as much as I hate it!&nbsp;   Good stuff now....hmm, I found a guardian angel,who kindof gave me a solution to my php program, but then the software works on all systems, but mine...:(( Seriously depressing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, am hoping to somehow find a way to make this work.&nbsp; Kindof reminds me of the days I sat with him and slogged it out with this software trying to dig out a bug and make it work.&nbsp; Finally found out that it was one stupid marker which we had ticked by mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping that this prob will get solved and will have the software working on my system soon, else I lose my bet...boohoo!  Today the first steps have been taken towards my team integration, and am hoping that this will make some sense in life and wont be yet another flop show.&nbsp; Because if its'a flop show, there is more to lose than gain in this!&nbsp;   Need to go and purchasea gift for my dad today, wondering what to get him.&nbsp; This time we will be visiting his ruling deity temple on his birthday, so am super happy over that.&nbsp; Am praying that this trip goes off well for everyone, coz it's a trip which will hopefully bring back the happiness to my entire family!  &nbsp;           "
"       Well, this was supposed to have been entered yday, but couldnt do it coz I was down with a severe headache and a touch of a fever building on me.&nbsp; Really struggled thro the day and closed the doors finally in the evening.&nbsp; A person like me, who hates to hit the bed before 10, fell asleep at 8:30, man, this must have been history in the making!  Anyway, the day as a whole was quite depressing, hardly was able to conquer my hurt & pain and the headache and body ache kindof added that extra dimension to the misery.&nbsp; In all, one seriously depressing day in my life..coz I felt emptiness at the very max today.  I have always wondered what it would be to be marooned on an island and have to live a few days there.&nbsp;It kindof feels to be a good thing...maybe a few days of solitude will help me forget these unanswered questions and move on with life??&nbsp; I dont know really, but then the more I think about it, I doubt I will ever get answers to my questions.  The only good news I got for the day was my close friend from Dubai was getting hitched finally, to her senior from Philly..and to top things off, she's getting married two days after her bro..and the wedding is at chennai.&nbsp; So I guess it's gonna be party time in teh 3rd week of August for me...four days of fun and frolic!&nbsp; I just hope the marriage blues will leave me by that time...:)          "

"       Life has turned out to be quite ironical so far with me.&nbsp; It gave me the best, saw to that I gave back the best to life and now has kindof left me in a situation where I am wondering where was I all this while...in my dreams or in reality?  Currently I am trying to move out of stranded phase, where I want to leave the past and move to the future.&nbsp; What to do, how to do ...where do I begin?&nbsp; Well, a set of interesting questions, but I think the answer really lies within me.&nbsp; I need to take that initiative and move on with stuff.&nbsp; There is simply no use holding onto something which gives one pain and hurt.&nbsp;  Yesterday I was watching the movie paycheck, and there was an interesting statement made in that..'life is a sum of all our mistakes'.&nbsp; Quite ironical, but then, its true.&nbsp; Everytime we make a mistake, we learn from it and try not to make the same mistake again.&nbsp; When we commit the same mistake the second time, we learn a new lesson.&nbsp; The process of learning never ends, its an ongoing cycle.  Life cannot stop for anyone, its' not the way of the world.&nbsp; Time governs us all, and this time only knows when and what will happen.&nbsp; You can dodge your destiny upto a point, after which it will come and bite you and when it does, you might even repent for having dodged it the first time.  As I initiate myself in the process of embracing my past, closing out the questions which haunt me and terrify me, all I pray is that the almighty stands by me again thro this process and gives me the courage to survive this.

"       Today was slightly different from other days in my life...esp over what I've been going thro' over the last two weeks. &nbsp; Got a bad stinker from one of the clients and had another breathing fire down my throat.&nbsp; Was a very different situation to work in.&nbsp; Not that my recruiters were firing all guns, hardly even remotely close to that. It's almost as though everyone at office had gone into snooze mode.&nbsp; I was in aworld of my own, trying to work my way thro' some quality issues which have been pending overtime.&nbsp; Had a long chat with my australian &amp; singaporein counterpart today and got an insight into myself, kindof forced them to do a little bit of an analysis on me.&nbsp; Was quite an interesting process as they said some stuff about me which made me sit up and wonder, hmmm, not bad, I have left an impression on ppl..;) &nbsp; Anyways, as the day rolled by, my past began to dance infront of me over and over again.&nbsp; Was having a tough time controlling my thought process.&nbsp; Everytime I waivered, I had to literally knock some sense into myself, kindof like a jolt of reality and come down to earth.&nbsp; Must say, a pretty painful process considering the amount of force I had to exert onto myself to block my thoughts. &nbsp; As office drew to a close, I began typing my previous days' blog on my sunday trip to Knachipuram.&nbsp; Was a nice trip, pretty nostalgic.&nbsp; Dad came to pick me up, was nice having a daugther and father chat after a long time really.&nbsp; Discussed my mental framework and current situation, how to make the best of what I have left and what I can make for my future.&nbsp; Painful thoughts as I had to accept certain things, my negativity which I had been blocking for months together began to come to the fore front and I was kindof hanging on to a thread which was slowly giving way.&nbsp; I was beginning to exhibit signs of loneliness,unhappiness, digust, pain, anger, frustration and every ther negative emotions which a human can feel.&nbsp; This was just not me, but this pain and misery was beginnng to take a toll on me. I need to work my way out of this, but I dont know how to.&nbsp; I think what I really need a tthe moment is some sound sleep, one of the many things&nbsp; I have lost oflate.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Here's hoping for a peaceful night of sleep and hopefully a better day tomorrow! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          "
"       Well, this was supposed to be my blog for yday but due to the pausity of the computer, last evening, I couldnt upload this. &nbsp; As usual, I had to fight for the computer, but then for a change I lost the fight this time around.&nbsp; Hmm...wonder if this is a new trend...hope not! &nbsp; So what was my sunday like, well, I guess this is how my sunday's are probably going to be spent by me for a few more months...haha! &nbsp; Woke up at 6am, and had to wash my hair...couldnt wash it on saturday coz it was amavasya, sooooo many rules!!! Anyway, once that ordeal was over, I had to rush and get ready for our temple trip.&nbsp; This weekend was&nbsp;more focussed on temples around Chennai.&nbsp; Todays' trip was to Kanchipuram.&nbsp; Quite a nice place, known as the temple town, it kindof lost a lot of its shine as the temple town and is now the official saree capital!&nbsp;  &nbsp; But then, the temples are still among the best and most beautiful ones.&nbsp; First, in the series of temples was at this place called Tirupakozhi.&nbsp; This is a very nostalgic temple for my family as this is the place where my maternal grandma came over, offered some prayers and after which my uncle was concieved.&nbsp; Infact my uncle is named after this temple deity, Vijayaraghavan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular temple has a tradition where women who are unable to concieve, take a dip in the tank at the temple premises, collect some green gram, roast it and then bundle it in a moist muslin cloth and have it placed on their tummy and knotted up.&nbsp; As normal scientific knowledge would say, once roasted, the pulse should not sprout, but as per the tradition here, this pulse will sprout if the woman is blessed by the deity, Managathavalli Thaiyar.&nbsp; Quite strange as it sounds, but since I have seen a few cases comes thro with this, I dont have much choice but to believe in the same. &nbsp; Next stop was a temple called Yadotkara.&nbsp; This is a strange temple, coz it has a lot of relation with a temple down south near Kumbakonam.&nbsp; The lord is supposed to have got angry at one of the kings and come to this place.&nbsp; Here he grants his devotee a set of wishes, so the lord here is called Sunna Vannukm Perumal.&nbsp; Amazing Andal here, really quite gorgeous a deity. &nbsp; Next Stop was at this place within Kanchipuram, called Tupur, this is the place where Vendanta Desikar is supposed to have been born and initiated his religious discourse.&nbsp; Yet, another beautiful temple with an amazing explaination.&nbsp; Here is the place where I learnt the meaning of Kanchi puram - Bhrama's home, and the meaning of Rameshwaram - meeting place of rama and Shiva, and the meaning of Kasi - the meeting of Light and Bhrama. &nbsp; We were to close the trip with a stop at Varadaraja Temple, but courtesy of some guy jumping into the temple tank, the temple doors were being closed as we entered the temple.&nbsp; Anyway, this temple I guess wasnt in our agenda for the trip, so no problem, will be visited in the next round. &nbsp; Then came lunch at 13:30, was feeling too full and droggy, think the medication which Iwas on was taking effect.&nbsp; So, just had a milkshake and tried to settle my stomach.&nbsp; The weather was quite bad yday and our drive back was made miserable with the innumerable broken and patched roads. &nbsp; Once I reached home, it had to be rest and relaxation time.&nbsp; So, ola, DVD time.&nbsp; This evening, it was a movie called ' save the last dance '.&nbsp; I think I am hooked to movies which revolve around dance and music.&nbsp; I think my interest in dance is on the up and probably I need to join back my dance classes and add some spice or shall I say salsa/ jive&nbsp;to my life. Nice movie, since I enjoyed the music, dance and ofcourse the story was built up decently. &nbsp; Later in the evening, it was off to the club, where to my surprise I got to watch the cricket match on a giant screen.&nbsp; Yeah, the match was lousy and I guess was lost in the first few overs of India's innings.&nbsp; Got back home by 10, and hit the bed...wasnt feeling too well..think all the medication is now starting to go ahead of me..and drain me out...anyway, here's hoping my stomach gets to normality soon.&nbsp; Its quite a pain to lose one's appetite especially when you love food. &nbsp;          "
"       Just a few minutes ago, was listening to this song from Robbie William, one of my favourites, kindof slipped away into my own world hearing it...  I sit awake There's an angel Contemplate my fate  And do we know The places where we go When we're gray and old'  Cause I have been told That salvation lets their wings unfold  So when I'm lying in my bed thoughts running through my head and I feel that love is dead I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  When I'm feeling weak And my pain walks down A one way streetI look about And I know I'll always be blessed with luck  And as the feeling grows She breathes flesh to my bones And when love is deadI'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead!

"       First and foremost, what the hell is this 'space' one talks about?  Well, this is something which different in a man's and a woman's perspective...  For men, if they say they want space, it usually means, I think I am getting bored, and need to check out some other women before I decide you are the one...this is a 90% probability situation, while for the other 10% , space simply means, you're nagging me just too much, I dont know if I can out with this for too long, so give me a break, let me return to sanity, and then come back to you!  For women, on the other hand means, let me think whats going wrong in our relationship and see if it can be fixed at all, this is 95% of the cases, and yes, theres' that 5% who use this cliche excuse to check out other men!  Why this difference in the meaning?&nbsp; Simply from the inherant nature of men and women...women tend to take more responsibility for the direction of the relationship, which is why, in most cases when a breakup happens, women tend to go thro' much more pain and misery than a man.&nbsp; It's kindof a situation like there's this part of them which is been removed from their system, something which they have nurtured and cared for.&nbsp;   So now, this brings us to the quesiton, why is the space so important in a relationship?&nbsp;   I would say with&nbsp;some level of affirmity, that without this space between a man and a woman in a relationship, things will simply get too hot to handle and instead of colourful sparks flying around, it becomes colourful remarks!&nbsp; Relationships are something like sugar, heat it in a spoon, first it liquifies, then it starts to bubble with energy, then it gradually changes colours, yellow..to light brown..to dark brown, then it gradually changes it consistency, and starts to come out like pines and needles.&nbsp; At this point, if removed you get to make the best of the bases for ice cream servings, but if you dont and continue to heat the spoon of sugar, the sugar turns black, it gets smoky and then turns into tar!&nbsp;   Just like sugar, when one gives the relationship, enough space and time to grow it becomes a beautiful base or even the basis for making the best of pralines, but if not given the right space and time, it turns into a bed of tar!  Space helps people realise the true value of their relationship.&nbsp; Its' not a case of simply taking a break and thinking, oh my I have taken a break, is the guy/ girl checking out other ppl, but instead thinking, right, where is my relationship now, is it heading anywhere, where are the areas of concerns, can it be fixed, if it cant be fixed, how to work around it, etc.&nbsp; If one is able to take a third person perspective of the relationship during this break time, its' the best antidote which can be provided to a shaky or volatile relationship.  Give your partner that space, understand what is the meaning of your relationship, then you will have it in you to understand the true magic of the relationship!          "
"       For many years thro' my childhood, I always wondered, what makes a person,'a special' person.&nbsp;   Thro' my schooling years, I had been travelling a lot, so never got to really check out my school mates well enough&nbsp;or make friends who has lasted beyond those years in that particular school.&nbsp; I had seen all my friends running around with their boyfriends, passing comments on the guys as they stood over 100m away, etc, but never could figure out what really makes a person attain a new height of a 'special' friend.  After very many years of pondering, keenly watching women and men go crazy over each other, I think I have come to a point where I can atleast contribute to this topic now..  So here are the 10 reasons I beleive justify elevating a person to a 'special' person category:  1. Trust : This is not something which drops out of the heavens, and is a value which needs to be truely earned at each and every level.  2. Selflessness : Putting 'you' infront of 'i', this makes a world of difference!  3.&nbsp; Dependability: When the entire world has shut it's doors on your face, you there's one person whom you can always turn you.  4.&nbsp; Advicer : This probably be the one and only person whom one will be able to digest any comment, whether nasty, sarcastic or developmental. This person is always a constructive critic!  5.&nbsp; Emotional Support : Irrespective of the nature of the problem, however personal it is, this is the one person with whom you should feel that you at letting down your burden from your heart.  6.&nbsp; Meaning of Time : Time will not stand in the way of anything.&nbsp; Whatever the time, time period, this is the one person whom you can count on to be there around you.  7.&nbsp; Respect : Irrespective of whether the entire world shuns you, this person still holds you with all the respect, mainly because they trust you to no end at all!  8.&nbsp; Determination: The power being able to focus ones' engry to hold things in a particular manner, and the ability to strive from there on towards the goal post with you, is what defines determination!  9.&nbsp; Smile : As trivial as it sounds, a smile is something which is necessary to keep any relationship happy!&nbsp; The power of positive vibes is more than enough to scare away all those fears and stupidity from your heart!  10.Commitment : The ability to stand against all odd and support you in the worst of adversities, provides just that rounded touch to any relationship!

"       A girl in love asked her boyfriend..   Girl: Tell me... who do you love most in this world? Boy: You, of course! &nbsp;Girl: In your heart, what am I to you? Boy: The boy thought for a moment and looked intently in her eyes and&nbsp; said, 'You are my rib. In the Bible, it was said that God saw that Adam waslonely, during his sleep; God took one of Adam's rib and created Eve. Every&nbsp; man has been searching for his missing rib, only when you find the woman ofyour life; you'll no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart.'   After their wedding, the couple had a sweet and happy life for a while.However, the youthful couple began to drift apart due to the busy scheduleof life and the never-ending worries of daily problems...Their life became mundane. All the challenges posed by the harshrealities of life began to gnaw away their dreams and love for each&nbsp; other... The couple began to have more quarrels and each quarrel became more&nbsp; heated.   One day, after the quarrel, the girl ran out of the house....&nbsp; At the opposite side of the road, she shouted, 'You don't love me!'&nbsp; The boy hated her childishness and out of impulse, retorted, 'Maybe, it&nbsp; was a mistake for us to be together! You were never my missing rib!'  Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood there for a long while....&nbsp; He regretted what he said but words spoken are like thrown away water,you can never take it back. With tears, she went home to pack her things and was determined in&nbsp; breaking-up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Before she left the house, 'If I'm really not your missing rib, pleaselet me go.... She continued, 'It is less painful this way... Let us go on&nbsp; our separate ways and search for our own partners...'  Five years went by.... He never remarried but he had tried to find out&nbsp; about her life indirectly......&nbsp; She had left the country and back.... She had married a foreigner and divorced... He felt anguished that she never waited for him. In the dark and lonely&nbsp; night, he lit his cigarette and felt the lingering ache in his heart. He couldn't bring himself to admit that he was missing her.&nbsp;   One day, they finally met.... At the airport, a place where there were many reunions and good-byes... He was going away on a business trip. She was standing there alone, with just the security door separating&nbsp; &nbsp;them.She smiled at him gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Boy: How are you? Girl: I'm fine. How about you... Have you found your missing rib?  Boy: No. Girl: I'll be flying to New York in the next flight. Boy: I'll be back in 2 weeks time. Give me a call when you are back...You know my number... Nothing has changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;  With a smile, she turned around and waved 'Good-bye.'  One week later, he heard of her death. She had perished in New York. In&nbsp; the event that shocked the world... Midnight..... Once again, he lit his cigarette...And like before, he felt the lingering ache in his heart...He finally knew, she was the missing rib that he had carelessly broken.   Sometimes, people say things out of moments of fury... Most often than&nbsp; not, the outcome could be disastrous and detrimental....   We vent ourfrustrations 99% at our loved ones... And even though we know that we ought&nbsp; to 'think twice and act wisely', it's often easier said than done.  Things happen each day, many of which are beyond our control. Let us&nbsp; treasure every moment and everyone in our lives.  Tomorrow may never come; give and accept what you have today.&nbsp;   Hope you all treasuring your own Ribs!!!           "
"        Mistakes are inevitable---we're all only human.    WHAT IF YOU ARE THE SOURCE OF THE MISTAKE. . . .  If you are the source of the mistake, these steps will assist with a speedy recovery, and will serve to build and strengthen the relationship for the future.   A. HONESTY. Be honest and forthright about your role in the mistake.  B. RESPONSIBILITY. Take responsibility for what has happened, and take the initiative to communicate this to others involved.  C. CLEAN-UP. Own your negative impact on the person or situation. Take steps, in consultation with those affected, to alleviate the problem or damage. A genuine apology, if called for, goes a long way toward mending the effects of a mistake. Make your sorry meaningful and not say it for the sake of saying it! D. ADDRESS FUTURE PREVENTION. Discuss what worked and didn't work in the specific situation surrounding the mistake, to learn how to avoid or minimize future problems.  E. LET GO AND MOVE ON. Let yourself and others off the hook.&nbsp;Allow the slate to be wiped clean.   WHAT IF YOU ARE THE 'VICTIM' OF A MISTAKE. . . . A. Go directly to the source for resolution. Don't clam up and then harbor silent and negative assumptions or judgments. Don't merely complain to others who are not in a position to or may not want to help resolve the matter.  B. Honor a code of personal behavior: be respectful, honest and descriptive as you confront the situation; avoid negative characterizations and conclusive statements---these usually just throw fuel on the fire.  C. Avoid assigning motive or meaning to the mistake until you have a chance to check your assumptions with the source.  D. Do share both your feelings on the matter and how the mistake negatively impacted you and/or others.   Learn to accept mistakes as a part and parcel of your life, there is no use running away from taking up the necessary responsibility for the mistake , it will never leave you in peace!&nbsp; Accept the mistake, accept reality, and dont' go about the rest of your life punishing yourself and others!&nbsp;  Accept things graceful, thats what a true human being does!  Say SORRY, there is nothing wrong in it, the world will not capsize under your own feet!          "
"       This is a short story which I read some time ago in my college or what it in school, dont remember when it was...something about taking a slap/ bite of reality!  We tend to take our blessings for granted, like the story about a homeowner who hired a real-estate agent to prepare an ad to sell his home.   The homeowner was reading the ad in the paper about his home's many attractive features.  He called the real-estate agent to say he no longer wished to sell. When asked what changed his mind, the homeowner said, 'After reading your ad, I realized I already live in the house I always wanted to live in.'  I guess most people understand the value of others only after they lose or almost lose what means the most to them!&nbsp; The difference in life is made when one decides to hold on to something which means the world to them , fight it out and not be held back by one's ego!&nbsp; It takes a lifetime to get over stuff when you lose something so dear to your heart!

"       My blog could never be complete without this all time favourite song of mine... the intoxication power of Love!  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand  I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of fire  Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire And in the flames Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire  This desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  And as she turns This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burnsI realize that nothing's as it seems  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies aboveI close my eyes  This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love   I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  Sweet desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  Sweet desert rose This memory of Eden haunts us all This desert flower  This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the love          "
"       For ages, have been a huge fan of the Beegees, mainly for their lyrics.&nbsp; One of their songs, which seems to be quite apt to what I have been going thro' for the last few weeks is kindof encompassesed in this song:  Breakout   It don't matter who you are  Anyone can be a star Brighter than the lightning You go as far as you go  You got to be what you know   There may be somebody out to get the better of you  You need the one good woman to keep you alive  Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head  Remember nobody left you on the railway line And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time   Breakout Ain't no one gonna break your heart &nbsp;You'll never do it if you never start &nbsp;You be there Breakout now  You gotta be a story told  And baby , no one gonna steal your soul  You be there If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  You've got it all and then you're lost in flight   There are diamonds in the street  But you don't get enough to eat  Walking on a wire  There is a future unknown  Nobody does it alone   (break)  And maybe you can be the thunder  If you follow your dream  There must be one good woman to show you the way  Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are  Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line and all the world gets crazy and you win this time   Breakout   Ain't no one gonna break your heart  You'll never do it if you never start  You be there Breakout now  You gotta be the story told  And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul  You be there  If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  You've got it all and then you're lost in flight  Breakout now  Ain't no one gonna break your heart  You'll never do it if you never start be there !!!

"       Quite interesting how the blogs are now becoming a mode of communication...a simple tool with which someone is able to express their feelings and add clarity to their lives...  Yet again, I had problems posting stuff on someone's comments page, I thought okay, anyway I need to update my blog, so why not address certain issues in this ....  1.&nbsp; Temple visiting bringing peace: anything with god for a truly religious person, will bring peace to one's heart to a good extent.&nbsp; But there is a&nbsp; saying that God helps only those who help themselves.&nbsp; One needs to truly believe in their heart and mind, that they can find peace, only then will they ever get close to that.  2.&nbsp; Trying to mend fences : well, this is something which I can do if I had a reason to do so, but right now I see no rhyme or reasoning coming from the other side of the fence to mend this.&nbsp; Anyway, as said by someone some time ago, certain lessons learnt can cause a lot of pain and grief to people, and trying to implement the changes will only make others experience more pain and misery.&nbsp; This is somethign which I dont think certain people are upto to facing up to!  3.&nbsp; Moving on in life : Its' just a process, one needs to try to take an initiative towards moving on in life, you cant wait for life to thrust something onto you to make your life.&nbsp; Unlike someone, I aint got people hounding them with horoscopes, photos of puny & cute women, ads, trips, training, etc, all I have is my work, workout at the club, trips out of chennai and my music.&nbsp; I am trying to find solace in this and am quite aware that this is going to be long process, but I need to make an effort towards this, coz I cant run away from this!  4.&nbsp; Memories : For someone who has been in love, that too true love, its far too tough and also not exactly humanly possible to forget these good memories. If one is able to forget these memories, it only shows the commitment they had to the relationship.&nbsp;   Today, after nearly 7 years, I went back to the swimming pool, was shit scared to get in, and felt oh my, I might just drown if I get into the deep end.&nbsp; This was the thought which was ringing in my head from my office to before changing at swimming pool dressing room.&nbsp; As I was changing, I began to wonder, hmm, I have swam before, learnt the art well enough, yeah I lost touch, so , does that mean I will drown if I set foot in the water...???&nbsp;&nbsp; I then decided, no more idiotic thoughts in my head, I will get into the deep end and swim across to the shallow end and back.&nbsp; In addition to this fear, I had this fear that, oh my what if I look depressing in my swim suit and people give me the stares.&nbsp; Another stupid thought which just filled my head, which I simply decided to overcome, and yes, I did check things out in the mirror before I got into the pool...geez I wasnt exactly a hippo and more than anything I believed in myself that I was taking steps to drop my weight, and this was good for me, so no use running away from it.&nbsp; Got into the pool, had a shaky start, had a little tough time getting to the other end, but within 10 minutes I was back to normalcy and could feel my body moving like a fish.&nbsp; How did this come, simple, coz I believe that my heart and mind are co operating with me, and also feel that I am doing the right thing, and nothing wrong at all!  Life is about choices, the choices we make may appear to make or break our lives, but usually the choices we turn down find a way of coming back to us later on in life, in a differnt wrapper....its' just the way you see life!&nbsp;   Wear your belief on your shoulder, trust yourself and you'll realise the world has a lot to offer, and there are a zillion people around you wanting to know you more!

"       Last week, I had the chance to watch this movie Flash Dance, after a really really long time...one amazing movie which revolves around one's belief to succeed in their dreams, and never give up....the road will always be there, just get onto the road, and get travelling...This is one of the songs in that movie, lovely liberating lyrics to dance to!  First, when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream  That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind  All alone I have cried silent tears full of pride  In a world made of steel, made of stone   Well I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm  Wrap around, take a hold of my heart   Chorus:  What a feeling, bein's believin' I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life  Take your passion, and make it happen &nbsp;Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life (Solo)  Now I hear the music, close my eyes,  I am rhythm In a flash it takes hold of my heart   chorus (with ... 'now I'm dancing through my life')   What a feeling What a feeling (I am music now),  bein's believin' (I am rhythm now) P ictures come alive, you can dance right through your life  What a feeling (I can really have it all)  What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)  I can have it all (I can really have it all) &nbsp;Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)  (call, call, call, call, what a feeling)&nbsp;I can have it all &nbsp;(Bein's believin')&nbsp;bein's believin'  (Take your passion, make it happen) make it happen  (What a feeling) what a feeling...

"       This is one lovely article which I had received a while ago in my egroup for Psychology...  Top Ten relationship wreckers!!!  1. Neglecting Your Partner (ignoring, workaholism, addictions):A primary function of a relationship is to provide companionship and to meet each other’s needs. When other activities, interests or preoccupations interfere with our availability, we can wind up short-changing our partner. This can be thought of as absenteeism. Taking an inventory and making adjustments in how we spend our time is the first step in correcting this problem. Treat your partner as the important person they are by spending enough quality time together to satisfy each of your requirements in this area and to maintain your connection.  2. Depriving Your Partner (not being attentive, expressive, affectionate, supportive, caring, loving):Being there physically is not enough. We cannot expect our relationship to thrive if we withdraw emotionally for extended periods of time. In order to be fully present, we must be aware of our partner and be willing to show how we feel both verbally and non-verbally. Expressing love though affection and caring behaviors are crucial to keeping a relationship strong and vibrant. Small regular doses of intimacy will usually suffice, and the most important times of day to communicate positively are upon waking, upon reuniting after a long day, and before going to sleep.  3. Dishonesty & Betrayal (infidelity, lying):Most people are aware that the foundation of any relationship is T-R-U-S-T. In no relationship is trust more important than in a relationship between mates, except for a parent and dependent child relationship. Cheating and lying breaks down the basis for a relationship, and often results in its demise. A problem of this nature is serious, and resolving it must be a top priority if the relationship is to survive.&nbsp;  4. Attacking Your Partner (blaming, abuse – physical, emotional, sexual):Aggressive communication is simply unacceptable, especially if the abuse is getting physical. Physical or sexual abuse are deal-breakers in a marriage/ relationship, and should prompt a permanent separation. The abusive partner needs to get professional help to learn skills in&nbsp;anger managemet, &nbsp;in order to gain and consistently demonstrate better control over his or her emotions and behavior. Even if the help is sought and progress is made, the risk of recurrence remains high, so in most cases, the abused partner should not return to the relationship. Returning serves to reinforce the abusive behavior, leading to increased severity and frequency of subsequent abuse. Instead, the abused partner should also seek help, and work through issues that have potential to lead one into another abusive relationship. Verbally blaming, accusing, and insulting your partner are less extreme forms of destructiveness, but are not OK either, and&nbsp;assertiveness training can provide the essential skills for healthy communication.  5. Scapegoating (taking your anger or frustration out on you partner):We all know that it’s not right to kick the dog after a hard day at work, so why do it to your partner? Being held responsible for things that are out of our control is the most stressful of conditions, and that is what we do to our partner when we scapegoat them. Rather than hurt the ones you love, do what it takes to meet the real problem head-on, as effectively as you can. If you are unsure of how to address a problem, the strong and mature thing to do is to ask for help and support from trusted sources (i.e., a friend, relative, or therapist).   6. Negativism (nitpicking, nagging, criticizing):In order to have a good relationship, the positives must outweigh the negatives by a large percentage. If negativity is creeping into your relationship, it is like water seeping into walls, eventually weakening the structure. People usually feel good around others who are upbeat and positive, as well as those who help them to feel good about themselves. Bringing a negative spirit into your relationship crowds out the positive. However, pushing aside or neglecting to address real problems is not the answer either, and can be just as harmful to relationship health as dwelling on the negative. So pick your battles wisely, strive to communicate effectively, and practice cooperative negotiation.  7. Gossiping (telling family or friends about your problems but not addressing them with your partner):That’s right, if you are talking about the problems in your relationship with friends or relatives but not working on improving the situation, that amounts to gossip. Gossip is not a productive way to handle problems, and can result in additional problems. For instance, your partner may feel betrayed that you revealed sensitive material to others that cause him or her to be embarrassed or uncomfortable around them. Also, if you promote a negative side of your partner or your relationship, others may get a distorted view, and changes in their attitudes and behavior may follow. Others may remember your conflicts long after you and your partner have gotten past them. Instead, work on improving your communication skills. Turn toward your partner, not away. If you need help, seek out the assistance of an objective third party such as a therapist who works with couples. When it comes to your needs, stop complaining and start asking!  8. Controlling Your Partner (“my way” or else, perfectionism, trying to change your partner, possessiveness):Wanting things to be a certain way and having preferences are completely natural and even healthy. However, when this tendency becomes extreme and starts to encroach on the rights, needs and desires of others, it can cause major havoc. Freedom of will and self-determination are basic needs, and when these are being threatened, negative reactions may include anger, resentment, and/or rebellion. If the need to control is a problem in your relationship, identify the motivations behind it and work towards dealing with those issues rather than acting them out with your partner.  9. Putting Yourself First (self-centeredness, selfishness, entitlement):It’s not “all about me,” folks. Letting one’s self interests take priority in an unbalanced way can be toxic to a partnership. The other person usually winds up feeling deprived, resentful, and unimportant. Furthermore, the more self-involved you are, the more you take your relationship for granted, the less you appreciate your partner, and the more alone you actually are. So if your relationship is slanted in this way, you also lose out, because you experience less of the joy that a true connection brings. You and you partner both get more from the relationship through reciprocity in giving and receiving.  10. Putting Yourself Last (self-neglect, passivity, self sacrifice):Martyrs are seldom happy. More often, they are angry, bitter, resentful, depressed and burned out. This is not to say that you should not consider others and be thoughtful in meeting their needs. But having a healthy relationship involves factoring your own needs and desires into the equation. You teach people how to treat you, and if you act like a doormat, you can’t completely blame someone if they wipe their feet on you. Learn how to stand up for yourself, practice assertive communication, ask and allow others to meet your needs, and take care of yourself as much as you take care of your loved ones.    What was wrong can often be made right:Problems can be used as lessons; we can choose to learn from them, and find a better way!           "
"       Happiness is not something you postpone for thefuture;&nbsp;it is something you design for the present.  Happiness is not an accident. Nor is it something youwish for. Happiness is something you design. The greatest source of unhappiness comes from inside.  Happiness is the art of learning how to get joy from your substance.   Lets take for example our relationships -   If your relationship doesn't have adestination, how will you know when and where you reach ?   Good relationships are no accident. Tough times can strike any relationship - family, professional or friendship. But deciding to be responsible and 'happy' in practical ways can result in relationships that are tougher than tough times.  Think about this. We see around many couples want to'fix' problems, but don't know how to reach it.  The most common and most fundamental thing these couples are lacking is the knowledge that - happy relationships is a decision. If you look at it from this perspective, you'd agree that love is not a feeling of a particular moment but it's a decision.  Love is waking up every day committed to honoring yourpartner for being with you. If you want to have a great relationship, it's up to you. If you want to be happy, it's up to you!          "
"       Its' the 26th of June 04...yet another day in everyone's life, but special in it's own way to each of our lives!  Today, after many days of controlling myself, I decided its' time to take courage and visit his blog and actually find out if he is posting stuff, or just reserving stuff for his 'better' half!&nbsp; Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was actually pouring his heart out into a blog, just like me.&nbsp;   Quite a funny thing happend then, I was actually planning to write a blog today on astrology and draw instances from predications made by astrologers, his and mine, and I found a blog on the same topic in his.&nbsp; Haha...I guess we always have been jinxed when it came to the thought process.  As I was going thro' the blog, there were a few thoughts which came to my mind, and thought hey, okay lets post some comments, but what do I see, his comments option aint working...hmm..so much for the best software solutions!&nbsp;   Anyway, so I thought okay, maybe its' done on purpose, anyway, which ever the case is, I thought I'd post my comments on this page itself, since most of it pertain to me....hahaha...the ghost of chennai! ;)  1.&nbsp; Pain has a beauty about it, it comes when you least want it, and when you cant take it the most!&nbsp; Its' when one survives thro' this pain that they become a greater human being!&nbsp; There seriously aint any fun in shying again from this pain!  2.&nbsp; Astrology:  Haha..this probably is the biggest irony.&nbsp; A few days ago I had a little bit of any insight into this first hand, and really one cant say if it works or not.&nbsp; Btw, his astrologer said that if he got married, it would be of his choice, yeah..obviously this can also be interpretated as, even if an arranged marriage it's really the girl and the guy who have the final say!&nbsp; Jokes apart, astrology has its own way of governing our lives, as much as we hate to believe it, some stuff comes true, some wrecks our lives, some bring us sweet memories, etc.&nbsp;   3.&nbsp; Me, the wrecker: This probably is the best compliment I have got for days about myself.&nbsp; Well, for whatever I did do to contribute towards messing things up, I have taken responsibility for that, but there is little or not reason which I see where others have taken responsibility and shown magnanimity to accepting the same.&nbsp; Each of my blogs have been steps which I have taken towards punishing myself for whatever mistakes I may have commited.&nbsp; I know myself, I have been true to myself always and forever!  4.&nbsp; Forgetting stuff....hahaha..this is probably the icing on the cake.&nbsp; I was planning to write a blog on friday on how ppl, especially guys seem to be able to walk away from relationships without having any feelings towards what has been lost.&nbsp; Infact, if I remember right, that was the day I spoke to a few of our common friends and discussed this issue.&nbsp; Quite surprising ...but yet another misconception!&nbsp; Anyway, one thing which is clear for me is that....my memories are ones which I will always cherish, its' god given stuff...I had some of the best times in my life....sweet memories can never be forgotten or ever erased!  5.&nbsp; Misconceptions:&nbsp; So much for thinking that the other person was out of it!!!! Hahahaha...nice joke....memories cant even fade away too easily....its a very tough job..and more than anything one needs something must more herculean to be able to battle past one's memories!&nbsp;   6.&nbsp; Second phase of life...Arranged marriage...hmm...commitment, oops...words a normal sagitarrian will shudder to even mention...but then as a human being, one has to say the words one day!  7.&nbsp; Big yet small world...we all live in a big world..and yet it is small coz everyone finds a way of relating to each other..and more than anything....time has it's own way of bringing ppl to terms with it's twisted sense of humour!&nbsp; Paths will cross, destiny's path is something which is decided, its more a matter of choosing to walk on the road or on the footpath!

"       This is a poem which was sent to me years ago...never actually figured out the meaning of this till&nbsp; this morning.... I sure do see a lot more meaning to this now...  Sometimes clouds cover the sun.&nbsp;  But when the go away, the sun is always there. Sometimes rain and storm cover the sun. Again, when the rain goes away, you see the sun. The sun is always there. Clouds, rain, storm, haze, whatever -- they come and go.  The sun is always there. Don't get attached to the clouds, the rain, the storm, the haze. They are temporary.&nbsp;  They don't last long.  They come and go. Detach yourself from these temporary inconveniences.  Free yourself of baggage, ghosts past, worries, fears, superstitions, prejudices, anger, jealousy. Free yourself. It's the sun that's permanent!          "
"       After a gap of two days, I thought this morning, hey, its' time to write my blog and etch into the history books what has happend to me...   Friday Morning.....  Woke up at 6 am, ran to the gym literally, wished everyone the best, gave my farewells to them and quite literally ran thro my workout.&nbsp; Reached home at 8, had a quick bath and got into my saree.&nbsp; Gosh, had it been ages or what since I wore one of these!&nbsp; Had taken a vow that I would not wear one of these, unless and until I dropped some weight...hehe...dropped a few kgs, so I guess this will count...;)&nbsp; Reached office at 9;10am, only to be hounded by one question, 'why saree?' and one comment, 'you look really very nice in one!' After a while, I think I kindof started to hear only this and it kept ringing in my head for hours together !&nbsp; Man, utter pain, I dont think I should ever wear a saree again to office.&nbsp; If for a simple purple saree people say this, wonder what they would say if I were to wear my black and red saree...hmm...food for thought I guess..hahaha!   Friday afternoon ....  This is where the entire trip began, took permission from office and began my trip down south.&nbsp; This was a trip with a difference since this time the reason was not me to drive down to my dad's native place, but my&nbsp;cousins and my dad.&nbsp; First stop was at Pondy, man, the hotels are getting reallly sad with their food or else my tongue has gone for a complete toss that I do not understand the taste of food any longer!&nbsp; Whichever the case, it was a rush and dash&nbsp; stop there.&nbsp; Once that completed, the drive down to Mayavaram began.&nbsp; We had promised one&nbsp; of the relatives that we would come down for a function at the temple, so this stopover.&nbsp; We reached Mayavaram at 7 that night, was all smoky instead the temple as the yagna had been in process for over 5 hours.&nbsp; Stopover here was a lot longer than me anticipated, from a planned 30 minutes stop it became a 1.5 hours stopover.&nbsp; My little cousins had come along from the native to join us here, so though the stop over was really long, I didnt really feel the pain of the time which elapsed.&nbsp; The dharshan at the temple was really good, though the smoke sure began to irritate my nose!&nbsp;   Then at 8:45pm, began the drive to my dad' native.&nbsp; Courtesy of the bridges being redone, a 40 minutes drive became a 1.5 hours drive, and with the complete lack of lighting on those roads, it was a complete nightmare.&nbsp; Slowly around 10:30 reached my dad's native.&nbsp; As I pulled myself out of the car,legs were totally cramped up coz of the long drive, I noticed that I had forgotten to bring my drawing notepad.&nbsp; Dinner was ready so after a quick wash it was a run to the dinner table.&nbsp; Dinner was followed by the first movie of the weekend.&nbsp; We started the movie at 11:30pm, a tamil movie called 'aetheree' and that went on till 1:30am.&nbsp; Good hilarious movie, simply didnt make too much of sense though...hahaha..but then, whats new to tamil movies, they never had story lines or any sense of connection. Once the movie was over, began the chatting session with my uncle, and that went on for over an hour, finally hit the sack at 3am.   Saturday....   Courtesy of the long night, I had to literally pull myself out of bed, as we had to visit a temple at 9.&nbsp; Once the usual cumbersome daily routine was over, the time to jump into a saree came again.&nbsp; I was kindof wondering which saree to wear, a red one or the deep blue.&nbsp; Both were quite sentimental sarees for me, red one had worn it to my grandpa's 80th birthday and the blue one was the one I wore to his sis's wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not able to decide coz both look really nice on me, so I asked my little cousin to pick a saree.&nbsp; He picked the red one, so it was the blue on for Sunday, for the drive back.&nbsp; I hurried into the red saree, almost tripped trying to fix it, was quite a hilarious moment on the road..hahaha.&nbsp; Today was electricity maintainene day, so no electricity from 9 am to 4pm.&nbsp; Man, wearing a saree and no current around is probably the worst thing which can ever happen!&nbsp; Anyway, got thro with that, visited the temples with my little cousins, two temples, Mudikondan and Sirupuliyur.&nbsp; Quite beautiful and quaint temples, of Lord Rama.&nbsp; Then it was lunch time, got back into town, had lunch at 2pm, and hit the sack for a while, actually for 15 minutes, only to be woken up by my little cousin stomping on my stomach.&nbsp;   Then began his entertainment time, I had to teach him, his sister and their friends origami.&nbsp; For the next 3 hours, all I did was teaching a bunch of kids who age ranged from 14 to 3, how to make water bombs, dragons, penguins, frogs, fish, butterflies and baskets.&nbsp; Man, it sure is one major pain to teach kids...god only knows how my mom does it so well!!!&nbsp; I guess Sagitarrians tend to be useless with kids...and should just leave that task to Cancerians!  At 6pm, my aunt and I decided to go shopping, but before we could actually leave the house, my dad decided that he wanted to go to another temple, so all plans got postponed.&nbsp; This temple we had to go was on the mayavaram road, and is a temple closely associated with our family.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the temple, my great grandpa used to do his pooja's at from the age of 5 and more than anything this is the temple at which my dad's star birthday was celebrate while my great grandpa was alive.&nbsp; The main deity in this temple is called Bhaktavatsala Perumal and looks so handsome.&nbsp; Even in the darkness, yep, no current yet again, his features were so beautifully highlighted that one could only but get lost his amazing eyes.  We finshed up with this temple by 8pm and just as I began to relax out my cousin arrived back from her tution class and she was completely determined&nbsp;to drag me out.&nbsp; I then quickly changed into something light and easy and went hunting for the driver.&nbsp; This was one useless exercise as the driver jsut did a major disappearing act.&nbsp; After 20 minutes of fruitless effort, I decided okay, just to adapt to the walk mode.&nbsp; At about 9pm, my cousin and my aunt began our walk to the shopping area.&nbsp; Narrow lanes, a zillion scooters, gawking bystanders, grrr...totally differnt experience.&nbsp; Reached the shopping center at 9:30pm only to be greeted by my uncle, who drags me across the counters to select some clothes for my parents and me.&nbsp; So much for my shopping!&nbsp; This exercise lasted for 50 odd minutes, not becoz there was so much of choice, but becoz there was so little!!!&nbsp; Was terribly&nbsp;nauseous at this point and needed something to drink atleast. We then headed to a bakery around the corner, was expecting&nbsp; a dingy hole, only to be presented with a shop with all the appearences of a Hot breads in a sleepy town of Tiruvarur! Had a drink here and settled my stomach&nbsp;a little, as my cousins tried their hands at a pizza.&nbsp; What a pizza they had,thepizza minus tomato, onion and capsicum...lol...yep, jus the base..hahaha!  By the time I reached home it was nearly 11pm, and that then the next movie began, Gilli.&nbsp; Electricity cuts,fluctuations, etc, did not deter me from checking this movie out and this ran on till 1:30.&nbsp; At the stroke of 12am, I wished my dad and was kindof a special occasion, coz this had never happend before.&nbsp; Never have I ever had the chance to wish him at the stroke of 12 on this birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the move was over, my uncle, aunt and I had a round of cards, and this game went on till 3:30am.&nbsp; Thats when sleep and tiredness began to over take me.&nbsp; Hit the sack at about 4am and was woken up at 6:30am the next day!&nbsp; So much for getting some sleep!  Sunday...  This was one of the most exciting days in this trip.&nbsp; After nearly 35 years, my dad's birthday was celebrated in his hometown.&nbsp; My, was he happy on what!&nbsp; We had arranged for a complete pooja at our temple and this was done with complete dedication.&nbsp; The pooja took some time and most of our plans were getting a touch disturbed due to the delay.&nbsp; Had our lunch at 10am, and then began our trip to my favourite temples with my uncles' family.  Another first which happend on this trip, visit to natchiyar koil on lord garuda' star birthday, yep, my dad and the lord share the same bday.&nbsp; To our surprise there was a major yagna happening there and it was quite a overwhelming time which we had here.&nbsp; The entire pooja took over 1.5 hours and by the time we were done here, it was almost 12:50pm.&nbsp; I was quite nervous that I would misss the next temple, Uppiliappan as it&nbsp; is one of the temples with which I have a very deep connection.&nbsp; We stepped into the temple at 1:05 and we greeted by the information that, since it was a sunday, the temple is kept open till 1:15pm.&nbsp; We made one dash to the main temple to be greeted by the priest who seems to have memorized my face courtesy of our 6 trips in the last 2 months.&nbsp;   Had an amazing dharshan here, upclose and personal, as they allowed my family to go right upto the main temple gate before the God.&nbsp; Suddenly, out of the blue, the priest came in front of me, and took some water&nbsp;and sprayed it onto me, and said, I understand what u've been thro', dont worry there's lots to go in life still.&nbsp; I dont know where than came up from , coz all he knows of me is a devotee who is a relative of one of the trustees in this temple.&nbsp; He then took out a garland from the deity and handed it to my mom saying, put this around her neck and ask her to go around the temple, the time has come!&nbsp; I was quite taken aback over this, coz I had no idea about whats going on, and neither did my parents.&nbsp;   We then tried to visit another temple, but found this place closed.&nbsp; Then my uncle and his family turned around and headed back home, while we headed back to Chennai.&nbsp; We had one more temple to visit on the way, one seriously long pending one.&nbsp; This was our visit to Srimushnam.&nbsp; One seriously amazing temple with regards to sculptures.&nbsp; This temple infact is supposed to have been a dance heritage and also is one of the 7-8 temples in the 108 divya deshams for which ppl believe that the deity appeared on its knows and no one has any idea of its history.  We finished up with this temple at 5:30pm and began the final lap of our journey.&nbsp; Gosh, one set of terrible roads, a drive which should have taken 20 minutes to get to a particular town, took over 90 minutes.&nbsp; The roads were a serious case of Rest in Pieces!!!&nbsp; From that junction, the journey to Chennai was quite taxing, heavy traffic, blarring lights, I just couldnt take it and fell asleep for 2 hours.&nbsp; All thro those 2 hours, all I could think was what the priest said...why, how ?&nbsp; As we reached Chennai, think about&nbsp;5 minutes or so to the toll gate, I then said to myself, dont ask questions, just take this at face value and accept stuff!&nbsp; As I took that decision and we crossed the toll gate, it began pouring heavily.&nbsp; We hardly had any visibility, road a quite slippery too! Slowly and steadily for the next 40 minutes, we drove into Chennai, at 11pm.  Was dead tired and jsut wanted to hit the sack, could feel the pain in my bones and my stomach was jsut about set to do a strike!&nbsp; Quickly heading into the house, gobbled up something to eat...and just hit the sack at 11:45pm.&nbsp;   This was what caught my imagination in the entire trip....Actually, after&nbsp;I completed two rounds of the temple, I went over and asked the priest what this was all about, since I was far too curious.&nbsp; All he said was, 'The time has come for you to make peace, believe in yourself and trust the future.&nbsp; Dont worry about the past, it will stay as memories for you always.&nbsp; There will be a time when all with make peace with each other, dont worry, have no fear over this!'  I dont know what made him say so, why he said so, etc, all I do know is that, Lord Uppiliappan is giving my life some direction now, and if it's his direction, so be it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the questions to which I wanted answers have been put at rest, I dont want to know anything more.&nbsp; Its' time for me to put my future in perspective and dream for my future now onwards!&nbsp;   Keeping this in mind, this morning I woke up at 6:30 am and prepared a list of things/ activities which I need to accomplish in the near future, max 6 months and began planning towards achieving them!   A few&nbsp;lessons I have learnt in this trip.....  1.&nbsp; Memories can never be washed/ locked away, its' always better to cherish them and smile over them, than treat it with disgust as a part of one's past. 2.&nbsp; You can try to change destiny, no harm in it, but destiny will always find its own way of bringing you back to the original path. 3.&nbsp; One needs to take responsibility of their own life, believe that life has a lot to offer them and not get bobbed down over the fact that someone else has something, or someone else is getting more out of life, or that you have lost something in a relationship which the other has not! 4.&nbsp; Our life is not a profit and loss story, its a cash flow statement, the profit as well as the loss, finds its own way of being ploughed in as an investment or getting marked in our lives as a Debt which needs to be adjusted somewhere else. 5.&nbsp; The human mind is a beautiful piece of architecture and mechanic, when you want to forget stuff it will see to that you remember and when you want to remember it will see to that you forget.&nbsp; You cant change it's nature, coz thats what we are made of!&nbsp; We are humans, and this is human nature.&nbsp; Blocking things/ memories/ running away, etc will never work, face the&nbsp; issue head on, thats when your mind and soul will be able to work in sync and allow you to find peace!  Life is a sine curve, sometimes your seated on the crest, sometimes on the trough!&nbsp;Life forces you to go thro' this sine curve only to test your strength in yourself & others!           "
"       This was a beautiful poem which was sent to me by a friend of mine....wanted to have it posted on friday itself, coz it reflected my mindset....  Kept myself educated and learned to train my mind...  So that one day my greatness would shine...  Too many people underestimated my ability and intellect...  That was no problem for me because I conquered every obstacle met...   Now faced with hardships unbearable to face...  Don't know how to rise again, so I just sat down and prayed... &nbsp;I knew that the day would come when I would surely fail... &nbsp;Never knew that I would sink this low and feel so frail...  After surviving all the years of hurt and pain...  My strength and determination would prevail through the rain...  Still difficult to climb that hill...  But my will is too great to stay still...   When all the dust settles and all the smoke clears...  I will emerge back on top higher than I have been inthe past years... For I have faith in myself and that's all one needs... To live in this world where it's difficult to succeed...   So when you feel like there's no hope and want to give up...  Fight with your heart, mind, and soul and I guarantee You will reach the top...          "
"       I think it's a disease for those single people to be all along over the weekends. This is quite an ironic situation with me, because technically I really have my hands full with work or some other activity, but my heart simply is not able to give a 100% to it yet.  No yoga classes for the weekend, so had to practise it at home.  This is one good thing which is happening in my life, brings a certain calmness to my life esp early in the morning.  After a really long time, think a good number of years, I woke up at 9:30am...but then courtesy of waking up so late, I have this headache which is totally irritating...hmm, this is the reason why its' said early to bed and rise & shine!   Dont know whether its early to bed or late to bed which really makes a difference, just feel that if I take more than the quota of 6-7 hours of sleep, I feel miserablly off!  My life appears to have become quite ironical.  There used to be a time when people used to pull my leg for going to sleep at 10pm, haha, and oflate my earliest nap time is infact 11:30/12....so much for being branded as an early bird.  So far the saturday has been a touch boring, just watched a hindi movie, Chalte Chalte, will have the movie review up in my movie blog soon.  Need to set up links to my other blogs from this one too, hmm, maybe a change in the look and feel...hmm.... wouldn't it be nice if one could change life's look and feel?            "
"       Well, finally after a gruelling 7 month period,after 7 months of seriously painful period of patience testing, carrot and stick treatment and begging and pleading sessions, one of my recruiters put in her papers today!   Man, am I a relieved soul or what!!! I have been literally begging the top management to relieve me from this pain for over 4 months, and its' finally happend!  I have had really my hearts content of misery with this recruiter, starting from mails, to arrogance, technical nonsense and even outright jumps in Authority!  On side there is happiness that I have been relieved from this pain and misery, and on the other side, there is unhappiness that it had to come down to this.   Now I will have to wait and watch as how she reacts to the entire situation, am quite sure that she is going to try and gather as much sympathy from everyone before she leaves and leave this place as a god's gift to resourcing!  God only knows if I am going to receive hate mail now...have had one round of it already, am I going to get another round!  Well,this is what I am going to do now...am going to pray that there is a smooth transistion and things pick up for my team!          "
"       Quite a strange thing to write about,but then, this is a reality dose for myself....After a lot of introspection this morning, and all thro' last evening, I did a lot of thinking and this is what I have come up with....  What makes Harini Smile... 1.  A warm hug from someone who I believe is a good friend and understands me! 2.  Sentimental mail about life, maybe a touch ironic, but yet realistic! 3.  A Smile on someone else's face because of what I did for them. 4.  A joke which has no hard feelings, yet light hearted enough to make me feel the warmth of the joke! 5. A pleasant surprise...!  So all those out there trying to bring a smile to my face, well, this is the way to go!           "

"       One thing which is a serious pain for a woman of 25yrs, in an indian society is to have people asking her when she is getting married, or for her to see all her friends around her getting married and settling down.  It's not as though that hurts her, but the way in which people then start to ask questions, and one suddenly begins to wonder if there is something wrong with themselves!  Painful a thought, but thats an insight into my life at the moment!  This morning, got a call from my schoolmate from Dubai, she's getting married this month, and wanted some help with regards to her makeup and jewellery etc.  I kindof was modest and told her that I exactly aint the right person to ask, coz I've never been thro' the routine to give expert opinions....odd, but thats the truth..as much as I am a good mix and matcher wth regards to stuff, when it comes to marriages, jewellery, makeup and sarees...hmm....dont think I'm up there still.  Nevertheless she insisted, and I said okay, and began to give her some pointers.  But then, since one cant exactly give a makeup routine or jewellery combination without knowing the sarees to be worn, I had to listen with great intent on the saree combinations too.  This was probably the worst thing which I needed to hear about!  I had to listen to saree combinations, for which occasion, who purchased them, etc.  Man, this was utterly painful, and completely ironic....I should have been in this position now, choosing stuff for myself...haha...and what do I get to do, I have the opportunity to instead do it for my friend and her to be sis in law.   Life can be ironic, but this is probably the worst thing I needed at the moment.  I really dont want to think about marriages, but all I have around me, people who remind me of the same, relatives who give proposals and unknown people asking questions to my parents as to why their 25 yr old beautiful daughter aint married!  This pain is something a little too unimaginable for me right now, I know what my parents are going thro'..but why cant people understand what I am going thro' before they keep jumping the gun, make statements & comments and open up my excessively bruised wounds!  This brings me to the question, which I have really been asking myself, Why is marriage such an important aspect for others with regards to me, but of absolute and complete hatred for me???

"       This is one song which has had a very powerful effect on my life for a longtime, actually ever since I heard it the first time in 1993!  Walk away if you want to. It’s ok, if you need to. Well, you can run, but you can never hide From the shadow that’s creepin’ up beside you.  And, there’s a magic runnin’ through your soul, But you can’t have it all. (whatever you do) Well, I’ll be two steps behind you (wherever you go) And I’ll be there to remind you That it only takes a minute of your precious time To turn around and I’ll be two steps behind.  Yeah, yeah. Take the time to think about it. Just walk the line, you know you just can’t fight it And take a look around, you’ll see what you can’t find, Like the fire that’s burnin’ up inside me.  Yeah, yeah. Oh. Yeah, baby. Two steps behind Oh, sugar, Two steps behind!         "
"       I probably had the worst start to my day after ages, this morning.  Got a call at 4am from my aunt, that one of my distant grandfathers' had passed away.  This grandfather was one of those cool grandparents I had, really cool guy, smart cookie and amazing in vedic maths.  He had been suffering with Spinal Cancer for over 1 year and really everyone knew his days were numbered.  Guess I just didnt want it to happen so fast!  Anyway, could hardly sleep after that.   Began my day with an hour of SS Music.  Was quite surprised, coz these guys too play some good music in the mornings.  Heard this song from Def leppord, been an age....kindof brought me to tears...probably my next post would have to be this song....'two steps behind'...one really moving song..and then heard songs from Micheal Bolton, 'when a man loves a woman', Rod stewart, Bryan adams, Sting, ' All for love', From the OST of Alladin, 'whole new world', George Micheal ' jesus to a child' & finally Duran Duran' ordinary World'.  Had to have some of the new medicines this morning, and man, are the terrible medicines or what, I almost feel as though I have morning sickness!!! Yuck..totally disgusting...!  This is the heights of non sense in my life, my eyes are burning like crazy because of the lack of sleep, my stomach is behaving like a rollacoaster, and I feel like I'm living in the theory of constraints!         "
"       Last evening, was quite strange to say the least. I was supposed to visit the hospital for a checkup, but was informed that the concerned doctor was coming in late, so it would be postponed.  But then, to my shock, the doctor called my grandpa and informed him that he had sent some tablets for me to consume for a month,and that he would do the evaluation based on the results, after a month.  This seriously ticked me off, coz no one is telling me really where the problem is, and instead just making me pump in more and more tablets.  Now the numbers are upto 9 tablets a day!  I hate tablets, its quite a painful thing to swallow so many of them!  Got a call at 6:30pm, from an old friend of mine, Vinay now working at Mphasis BFL, HR guy, sweet fellow.  Had completely lost touch with him for over 2.5 years, and was pleasantly surprised by his call.  He had got my numbers from a common friend of ours, working at Wipro, was quite surprised that that guy actually had my numbers..hahaha...Spoke to him for about 15-20 minutes, about work, relationships,singlehood, parties, studies, was quite nice.  Then suddenly towards the end of the conversation, he was, 'Harini, there is a friend of my boss who wants to talk to you, have given him your numbers, and probably he will be catching up with you at 7pm, he's a really nice guy, so dont rip him up!'  I was quite confused over what he said, and asked him, 'hey, dude what are u upto? 'And his reply, 'your single and available right?'  I was like, 'huh? what do u mean by that', and all he said was,' be patient...talk to you tomorrow...adios !'  The next 10 minutes waiting for this guys' called made me a complete nervous wreck, was left wonder what the hell was going on.  Then, at the sharp stroke of 7pm, he gave me a call, interesting deep voice,must say.  This chat happend over 3 breaks really, 7 to 8:15, 8:30 to 9:10, and then 9:20 to 10:10pm.   The first phase of the chat was a very general one, where he gave me an insight into work he does, hes' a HR person too, but refused to tell me where he worked.  Just said, will tell you about that later.  I was like,hmm...okay fine.  Then had a chat about my work, bosses or shall I say the lack them completely, work related problems in HR, etc.  The second phase was mainly on a person level, about my hobbies, his love for expensive suits, and then  the movie  HUM TUM, had a 15 minutes discussion about that movie, was quite interesting...then had this chat about European markets, the lifestyle, did a comparision to the indian markets, was quite an intellectual discussion for a change!  Quite a funny thing in this was that he was trying to sell Blore as a great city to me, which was where he was, the bazaars, the best of the hangouts, cosmopolitian life, etc.  The third phase was where things suddenly change, he began to ask me questions about my sensitive areas, my relationships, belief in relationships, relations at work, my weaknesses, etc.  This is where I suddenly became acutely aware that the discussion was heading in a very different direction.  So, up went my antennas' and began to carefully answer each of the questions from there on.   It was kindof getting late too, and at about 10am, I kindof drew the confidence from god only knows where, and asked him, so why you interviewing me....? He then replied, ' hmm, smart girl, thought I'd be able to get most of the information out of you and then drop the bomb.  Was a pleasure having a nice intellectual discussion with someone after ages, and with someone as talented as you, was especially a lot of fun.'  I then was quite shocked, and said, ' okay, so which firm do you work at?'  And then came the big one, ' Oh, me, I work for IBM at Blore.  We just happen to be hunting for a HR person and Vinay kindof gave you a very strong recommendation. Was quite curious to know why he was strongly recommending you, so decided hey, lets give you a call and check you out.  Was kindof in a good mood, so decided to first get to know you and then try to gather inputs on you. '  I was absolutely taken aback, coz I didnt know whether to be angry for being put on a wild goose chase like this, or give vinay a call and scream my guts at him...or thank this guy for the opportunity!  Was an absolutely hilarious situation to be in!  Best part of the entire deal was that, I never mentioned to anyone that I was thinking of a change, coz I really aint at this moment, too many commitments at home to comply with...god only know where such things come and fall on my lap!  Anyway, finally I thanked him for a seriously interesting and different interview...hahaha..man, will never forget this.  I then gave vinay a call, spoke to him for about 20 minutes, had a good laugh over stuff...and asked then headed to bed with memories of a seriously different day in my life flying across my mind!         "
"       Today I am going thro' this funny fear...I hate visiting hospitals, they give me a lot of bad memories, esp the ones related to my surgery I had on my knee.  Well, no choice really, need to visit the doctor today and check out whats really wrong with me.  I have this fear which is growing in me, dont know really how to put it.  Did a round of checkups yday, and was quite weird, well..hopefully I will get some answers today.  Need to run thro' the usual bunch of tests...dont even like the thought that I need to give blood....hate the sight of it..and the sight of needles, man, thats enough to freak me out completely!!!  Just hope this entire thing just blows over really fast, and I am perfectly back to normal health soon...dont want to look like a zombie on the move!          "
"       Looks like I have been cursed with regards to my weekends, something or another goes wrong with me here!  My saturday was quite disturbing to say the least.  Actually, most of this started off on Friday evening, when I kindof went into this lull and complete depression.  The birthday party brought back a whole lot of memories for me and that absolutely ripped thro' my soul, I could feel this agonizing pain run thro' my heart.  Friday evening, I needed a change desperately after the gloomy time I had at office, and headed to the beach for a walk.   Man, one weird thing, but somehow usually the beach tends to calm my nerves down and it did a good job, but the effects were only temporary.  I walked at the beach, one solid brisk walk for 30 minutes and then picked up my aunt and headed home.  Rest of the day was most uninteresting to say the least!  Saturday start was a touch dull and boring, but towards the afternoon the spice began.  No idea really what happend to me, all I do know ws that I was hit by a hurricane.  All the medicines which I had been consuming, with god only knows what else began to takes its toll on me.  It all started off with a headache, nagging one.  I thought okay, must be one of those pshyco things, picked up a few DVDs and headed back home.  Watched this movie called HUM TUM, hindi movie, which if literally translated means, We U...!  The movie was one really good one, and personally enjoyed it, due to two reasons, It gave me some relief from my thinking mode and two, It re instilled by faith that our life is a long one, one never knows when and where their paths with cross and with whom, the uncertainity is really what makes life interesting and not driven by pain.  As I was completing up with this movie,  my little cousin called me and informed me that a group of us were heading to Spidey 2 and tickets had been purchased for me too.  So it was spidey time, the movie was pretty well made, good and worthy sequel.  But then towards the end of the movie, my headache got really bad and from absolutely no where this feeling of naseua took over me.  I headed back home at 7pm, and hit the sack.  Think I slept for 15 mnutes, and the nxt thing I knew was tht I was feeling so absolutely queezy in life & was running between the loo and my bedroom, poppin medicines.  This was a horrible feeling for me, and the pain of being stuck in such a situation was miserable to say the least.  Then as though my probs were not bad enough, my body decided to play a nasty game with me, and I developed severe muscle cramps at about 9pm.     With no medicine having any effect on me, courtesy of throwing up stuff over and over, I headed to my grandpa, to seek some emotional strength.  The pain simply began to take over my senses completely and there was hardly a minute I could stay without thinking of my soulmate, he was always this person who wanted to be with me when I was sick and in pain...haha, when I needed him the most, he just couldnt be there for me.  So ironic....after all that has happend in my life off late, all the nasty stuff said, all the pain caused for people around, all the sadness which still fills my heart, and all the so called anger which I am to have towards him, I still couldnt stop thinking about him thro' every second of those 7 hours of pain!  7 hours of pain which ripped thro' me completely, so bad that the doctors at home are quite baffled with my body.    Anyway, this pain continued on and on, medicines were having no effect at all me.  Even my uncle who is a doctor came in at 3:30am in the morning to give me relief, but all went in vain. Finally with no choice left at all, I was given an injection, and that knocked me out at 4:30am.  All the pain seriously got to me and I couldnt even hold myself.  Couldnt tell my parents even that I had a blackout the previous day, coz then they would get seriously worried.   Should be heading to the hospital this evening to do a complete checkup, since I totally scared everyone out of their skins today.  God...why the hell am I being put thro this emotional and physical torture....its killing me....I've stopped asking questions, so why stil this emotional and physical turmoil for me!!!         "
"       For a long time, while watching serials like B&B, Santa Barabara, Dynasty, Young and restless,Neighbours, etc, I used to wonder when the reference used to be made about your 'First true love'!  Everytime, it used to be picturized as this feeling which was unmatchable, and something which could never die from your life!  I used to wonder, hey, its' just a person who comes into your life and then moves away, and you then move to the next person...so whats the big fuss all about?   But then, a few days ago, I began to take a different angle to this ideology and decided to do a little research on why it is said that ' true love is the purest form of love, and why one cant ever get over it for life! '  First and foremost, when does a person fall in love the first time?  Well, one can hardly say, coz true love is quite different from a crush or an infactuation, it's this feeling of weightlessness which overtakes a person and makes them feel that the entire world in which they exist is too perfect, when in reality, they know quite well that it's far from being called perfect!  When one falls in love for the first time, the emotions which conquer the heart and mind are quite unimaginable really, everything feels amazing, there is a complete halo aroud the person and things feel absolutely perfectly warm and  romantic!  When does this happen to people, well, can happen at the age of 10, 50 or even 80...one never knows when they'll find that first person for whom they will have such overwhelming feelings for....it just happens one fine day!  Everyone remembers their first love. Few experiences will ever be as intense and overwhelming as your first crush.When teenagers develop a sense of extraordinary closeness with another person, the experience has echoes of the close contact between mother and child in infancy. Falling in love as a teenager is more intense than the experience in adulthood. But these early relationships usually burn out quickly!   Falling in love for the first time is like taking your first go at cocane!  As funny as it sounds, the effects are very much the same, a heady mix of emotional and physical passion with your partner.  So how does one know that they are going thro' the process of falling in love for the first time?  Researchers have identified three phases of love. The initial physical response is 'lust'. The falling in love is called 'attraction'. The emotional commitment, required to make relationships last in the long term, is known as 'attachment'.  The first cuddle, the first kiss, first hug, first date and many firsts will always linger in your mind with all other special memories of your life!   So why is it so tough for people to get over something as your first love? Isnt it just an experience like another?  Its' not as though we dont fall in love and out of it again?   Well...the answer is quite simple, like all special things, its the first experience, the first of the addictions in your life...the first step towards maturing...the first step towards adulthood!  Can one ever forget their first love?  No way, its a part of your history, your life on this planet!  For any amount of pain which might have gone with this experience, its an experience worth cherishing for a life time...the first time you fall head over heals for a person and that person reciprocates the same feelings towards you!  Love is an addiction, you cant kick this habit without finding another addiction to get addicted to!          "
"       Now this one topic which has always got my attention, since I am just the type of person who is quite uncomfortable with the thought of making a commitment to someone whom I dont know well enough. This was a bit of a dormant topic, till yesterday, when I was watching this news cut on a news channel about Live relationships, and the gaining popularity of this concept among Indians.  I personally have always liked this concept essentially for the following reasons: 1.  Good check of compatibility under the same roof 2.  Easy transition to a commitment of marriage 3.  Better learning experience 4.  More quality time gets to be spent with your partner In all:  It gives you a chance to test out the waters before taking the Big plunge.  But then, are there negatives to this situation ??? Well, I can only think of the following: 1.  Things are taken for granted 2.  The relationship starts to be more driven by Sex, than that of an emotional commitment. 3.  People get into the mode where they take things for granted and forget to spend time with each other!  Funny but dont these negatives really sound more like the downsides of marriage? Hahaha...!  So whats the difference really! Well, as far as I'm concerned, Live In relationships is a commitment of a non legalised sense, essentially a marriage of two souls which aint on paper!  Well..some people can also see this in terms of Co habitation....kindof like a due diligence process which needs to be completed before the final jump!   Just curious but in this form of relationships...is the independent self maintained at all???          "
"       Was reading this interesting article online, and kindly did a little bit of analysis on where I could have gone wrong in this..and try to rectify next time around...  How prevalent is office romance? I did an unscientific survey among my colleagues and discovered not only had they had at least one office romance, some of them met their spouses at work. Other experts report that dating colleagues is indeed on the increase. And it’s no surprise. Employees spend a lot of time at work and many of them have no intention of spending their careers with one employer, so the potential of negative career impact has been blunted. The influx of younger workers has brought a more casual and accepting attitude, as well. And meeting a soul mate at work is more likely than at a singles bar or at an Internet site, since people already share common goals and interests.  Does that mean it’s accepted and a good idea?Not quite. While most CEOs I know admit that office romance, like office gossip, is impossible to legislate against, it doesn’t mean they have to like it. For example, they worry about sexual harassment lawsuits - by a jilted lover, or by someone else, who feels one of the parties is getting favored treatment. They also feel that productivity can be negatively affected. And what if one of them is transferred or fired? Sometimes it means both leave.  What are some of the negative ramifications of an office romance?Like it or not, you are now seen as a couple, rather than as an independent person. It can limit your job promotions and lateral movement, since companies don’t want a couple working together or reporting to one another. Other people are on guard and filter what they tell either member of the duo, anticipating that it will be cocktail conversation that evening. Colleagues assume the pair has lost their objectivity regarding the productivity and results of the other. If the relationship goes sour, and odds are it will, a nasty break up can wreak havoc on an office. The drama can be worse than reality TV.  Can’t a relationship be discrete and professional? It’s possible but it takes mature people who have clearly articulated the rules of engagement. Such as: Never date a married colleague.    Never date someone who reports to you, or who could have an impact on your work.   Don’t use the company email to send love notes or engage in excessive online chatting while at work. You don’t want to give the impression you are distracted (and email can be monitored).    Don’t drive to or from work together.   Don’t lunch at work or arrange to meet for breaks.   Refrain from “walk bys” (where one of you walks by the others desk just to chat or “drop something off”).  Arrive at company events separately and network separately. It’s important to maintain your individual identity with your colleagues.    Avoid traveling on business together. It looks unseemly and makes people wonder if you’re focused on the task or dating/vacationing on the company checkbook.    Don’t discuss your relationship with people at work. It will be telegraphed on the gossip hotline. Believe me, they will find out soon enough without you helping them.    Have a heart-to-heart discussion and get agreement about how you will handle a lovers’ quarrel or a break up. It’s not a romantic topic but it’s important to set some professional boundaries if you split.  There are two aspects to your success: your performance and how you’re perceived. Ideally, your private life should be private but it rarely is - especially if you date someone at work.          "
"       All these days I have been wondering about my relationships, how I went about each of them and what went wrong in each of them.  But till date, I never actually thought about what I learnt from each of them.  Thats pretty, coz as a HR person I should have actually found a reason behind the attraction towards each case...  Today while sitting at work, I was pondering over my nightmares which I have been getting for over 2 weeks on and off, and I figured, there is obviously a lack of completion in each case.  But what is it that was missing..then I realised, a lesson from them!  I think I can talk about two major learnings I have had, from all the relationships I have been involved in to date...  1.  Ethics : Every relationship is governed by certain ethics and values which bind us to our daily lives.  We cannot assume we are above or below those standards, never try to break away from those ethical standards, it will only conjure up painful moments where one will stand caught in between Morals, ethics & values on one hand vs. emotional tie ups/ commitmetns!  2.  Silence : Sometimes silence has this amazing power which can heal a lot of problems. Words said in haste, can only but wreck even small chances of fixing a pace maker to the heart of the relationship!  My sessions at yoga have made me realise this to a very good extent!  To tell you the truth, actually had a chat with a close friend of mine, who is now rocking the products world in Hyd.  He kindof made me think about a few things in my relationships, why I have been confused, why I am trying to drive at peace and not being able to reach my destination!          "
"       This was an article which I had read a few weeks ago....thought it kindof makes sense to me....actually lot more sense to me now...  'A person is limited only by the thoughts that he chooses.'  You are not limited to the life you now live. It has been accepted by you as the best you can do at this moment. Any time you're ready to go beyond the limitations currently in your life, you're capable of doing that by choosing different thoughts.  We each earn the income we do today because that is the amount we have limited ourselves to earn. We could easily earn 5, 10, 20 times more if we did not limit ourselves through the thoughts we maintain. Don't believe that's true? Surely you know people who earn much more than you who don't have your education, your skills, or your intelligence. So why do they earn more than you?  I love the story of George Dantzig that Cynthia Kersey wrote about in Unstoppable. As a college student, George studied very hard and always late  into the night. So late that he overslept one morning, arriving 20 minutes late for class. He quickly copied the two math problems on the board, assuming they were the homework assignment. It took him several days to work through the two problems, but finally he had a breakthrough and dropped the homework on the professor's desk the next day. Later, on a Sunday morning, George was awakened at 6 a.m. by his excited professor. Since George was late for class, he hadn't heard the professor announce that the two unsolvable equations on the board were mathematical  mind teasers that even Einstein hadn't been able to answer. But George Dantzig, working without any thoughts of limitation, had solved not one, but two problems that had stumped mathematicians for thousands of  years. Simply put, George solved the problems because he didn't know he couldn't.  Bob Proctor tells us to 'keep reminding yourself that you have tremendous reservoirs of potential within you, and therefore you are quite capable of doing anything you set your mind to”. All you must do is figure out how you can do it, not whether or not you can. And once you have made your mind up to do it, it's amazing how your mind  begins to figure out how.' And that's worth thinking about.          "
"       Yesterday I had to run thro a series of test, was a major pain, simply hate giving blood and running myself thro' tests.  After 45 minutes of that, I began to feel like a person who is totally sick and hardly has anything left in her system!  Anyway, the purpose of the tests was to give the doctors some direction on whether the medication is having any effect on my system, and they sure did get an answer....absolutely no change in the parameters.....totally depressing!  Looks like my system is getting immune to the medication too...hahaha...well, anyway, the docs now have decided to up the medication strength and check if atleast then I show any improvement.  God only knows whats up with my system, mind and soul aint in sync, that I know, but then, for how long is it going to go on like this???  It's getting too depressing for me to handle!  These medications are supposed to make me better, but somehow show no effects in a positive sense really.  These idiotic medicines are now promoting a weight increase, high levels of nausea, dizziness, grrr, what more can a people who is emotional disturbed want to complete the emotional rollacoaster!!!!           "
"       The day so far as been an interesting composition of unexpected stuff and expected stuff.   Been wondering about some stuff in my professional side, and kindof getting some answers on that quarter now.  Its' kindof like a point where you understand where you are heading to and what you really want in your career.  I think I have finally got some sense of direction on this now,guess I need to now let a few things roll out and then I guess I might be in a better position to access my progress in my plans.  Had a very interesting chat with an old school friend of mine, he had kindof run away from the US after a breakup and come to India recently.  He said this really interesting thing about breakups and healing, in the story oliver twist, after the breakup, an old and wise man said to Jenny, 'time will heal you', Later in the story Jenny says, 'yes, he said so, but never told me how long it would take!'  Well, as true as it may be to the 'T', thats the way love goes!  It's an addiction which can never be snapped out of, unless and until another addition overrides it!          "
"       This weekend probably was interesting in a different sense when compared to my last weekend.  The few things that were really there in common were, the 9 pills, which is now up to 10 plus some weird syrup which tastes like a cross of complan and bricks...the thinking mode for the weekend...and one injection...hahaha!  Well, things kindof got started on saturday when I watched this movie called Chalte Chalte, quite an ironic movie about this guy who seem to do everything wrong with this girl, she marries him, and he continues to let her down.  Whatever he did, he did it wrong and earns her anger and heartbreak.   The biggest joke is that the woman knows that he wont change and yet goes back to him just becoz he begs!  Man, this is the heights of stupidity!  Where is the sense of remorse or atleast a show of reason to change for your partner!  Anyway, movie apart this kindof set my thinking mode off.   I needed from fresh air and my parents were kindof busy, so I decided saturdays I will head to the park close by and do some serious work there....so it was for the next 1 hour, I headed to the park and did some thinking in the walk mode.  For that one hour I just analysed my life, where I stood, what I had lost, what I had gained, what I needed to do, what I needed to shed.  Ofcourse, before I realised it began to get dark and needed to head back home, so had my exercise for my mind and body really...Was supposed to head to the beach in the evening, but due to the arrival of my uncle and aunt, just headed the club.   At the club, my next level of thinking began, and there were just two questions which came to my mind.... 1.  What makes me a woman who can swing to any extremes to make people happy? 2.  What sort of a family situation will make me bring happiness to people around me?  To answer these questions, I took out a piece of paper and began to write a long open letter about these two areas.  The more I thought, the more the thoughts kept flowing.....and what do you know, before I knew it the stress began to go sky high and my legs started to go numb slowly.  Thank god for me, was heading back home by the hospital, so took a shot and then headed home.  Obviously, in this condition no one would allow me to sit and do anything, so was packed to bed at 9 pm...boohooo!  Sunday...hmm...different issue altogther, woke up at 9;30am, and decided I was gonna relax and totally chill off.  Spent some time with my uncle and aunt, initiated work on a few pending orders, and then headed to have an oil bath.  Gosh, never realised to what extent I am a 'hot' person..;)  hahaha...well, got the ordeal over with shikakaai....more in my eyes ..hahaha...and some sambarani......hair smells really odd now!!!  Then sat down for lunch at 2pm, boring lunch...hardly felt like eating, so skipped most of the stuff.  Then sat down with my parents and finalized the house plan and gave it to the architect for his expert comments.   Just hope this house comes out well, have done most of the design work in this...and should have one awesome room in the first floor, more like a studio for myself, with french windows and a painting area......and a nice bathtub to doze off hahahaha...with a good walk in wardrobe...hmm..that reminds me ..need to do some big time shopping....hardly been to spencers oflate....or maybe I should head to T Nagar or Pantheon road and pick some hip and low cost stuff up...hmm.....need to ponder over this one!  Seriously need to re stock my wardrobe....its got too boring..too many blues, greens and pinks...need to add some variety....maybe some reds, purples and browns...hmm.....maybe silver.......got this nice salwar from my uncle, a beautiful black with gold work.....looks gorgeous....need to re stitch some areas...too large for me...hahahaa!   Other than this, it  was one boring time with my aunt, hunting brides for my cousin..hahaa...had my grandparents bugging me to check out some guys...but I was like, hey, am the kid of the family, spare me....the queue is jammed in front..;)  Good joke, bu they refused to buy it..hahaha!  One thing is for sure, this weekend was quite an interesting one, very introspective, enriching for my mind and soul and more than anything, gave me a sense of direction for my artistic side!          "
"       This morning, as I was doing my yoga, I suddenly got this really interesting idea for a book or movie.  Its' quite a different line of thought...need to really now do some research on it and see it the basic idea behind it can click....  Keeping my fingers crossed...:)          "
"       This weekend wasnt exactly the most exciting of my life, was the run of the mill activity, for a few diversions really...  Saturday...  Woke up at 6am(heaven knows why I wake up so early even on holidays), did some light exercise and then sat down to my painting work by 7:30 am.  Kindof lost interest mid way and left the painting at about 10am.  This painting was due in feb 04,but I couldnt work on it coz I simply wasnt mentally atuned at that time.  I then sat down and watched Khakee.  This movie was a little too predictable for me, but nevertheless good acting across the board.  Had a very late lunch at 3pm, as I was unable to eat anything, effect of not exactly being able to digest my breakfast, stomach and eusophagus was a complete mess!   Evening was really spent at home, except for a visit to the eye doctor to check my eye sight and see if there are any issues.  Thinking of moving to contact lens in case the power doesnt stabilize and I cant do my LASIK. Courtesy of the medicine put in my eyes, hardly could watch the tv too!  Had a pretty stormy discussion with my dad on marriage.  He was pretty bugged to the max after having that chat with me, and kindof gave me a ' you just cant be corrected!' shrug at the end of the discussion!  Well, thats me, the woman who refuses to bite the bullet right now!  Sunday... Parents had to go out for a function, and granny wanted to visit our religious pontiff.  Since there was no one else to go along with her, I had to be her guide.  Had to hunt for a saree at 6am, lousy task esp since most of my mom's sarees are of rare colours!  Finally found some saree, wore it and rushed downstairs, almost tripped over.  Man, it could have been an interesting thought...sliding down the steps in a saree...rofl!Could have been a serious sight..hahaha!Anyway, the visit to the Ahobila Mutt was okay, heavy crowd since it was Independence Day and  a sunday. In all of that crowd the pontif took a few extra momemts..okay, not moments,  lot of extra moments...for me and my granny, got royally ragged by him over issues like what the mutt stood for, about my work and finally the one issue I simply hate talking about...marriage! After 20 minutes of a complete drill, I was short of running out of that place.  Reached home at 11:30am, to be greeted by my parents who were just leaving for the ceremony. I was feeling miserably down, stomach hasnt been doing too well, so decided to skip lunch.  Sat down and watched ' Addicted to love'...interesting movie must say, good and hilarious...had a good laugh over it and kindof began to feel a little better. Aunt wanted some lousy matrimonial stuff to be done, finished with that, and was once again left back in a lousy mood.  Had to shift thro' a zillion profiles, for my cousin bro and a cousin sis too!  It was miserable,as I had to go thro' guys profiles and my aunt and others would comment, we could check that for u,grrrr!  Man, I hate this marriage process....so lousy!  Anyway, in the process, also got to see the ad placed by my ex's parents.  Quite an interesting ad, must say, wonder who their target audience is!  Anyway, after a lousy matrimonial hunt session, I had something to eat as I was feeling dizzy.  Was around 4pm, then decided to watch  a movie, so checked out 'what a girl wants'.  Nice fairy tale, warm cuddly movie must say.  This was the moment where I began to feel my emptiness, so I had to go to the temple to smooten myself out.  I then headed to my favourite temple in town at Luz, drove past the beach....amazing cool wind was blowing across, but the minute I had a look a the crowd, I just turned and headed ot the club.  Club was its usual boring self, had dinner and headed home.  Once I was back home...hmm...had an interestingly noisy discussion with my mom on the favorite topic of the house...yep, marriage...I suddenly have this funny feeling of wanting to run away from home...jsut to avoid talking about this topic!  Man, this heat is getting too much for me to handle....might just a scoot from this place!           "

"       the third singapore kendo championships was held on sunday. i was tasked as an announcer for the competitors. the highlight of the event was the men's senior. never have i seen such spirit in people. their determination to win was amazing. in a year's time i hope that will be me.         "
"       i managed to survive wednesday's training despite me feeling the effects of the flu. i couldn't feel my arms as me muscles were already beyong fatigue. peter sensei gave us fifty jogeburi, shomenuchi, sayumen followed immediately with 200 hayasaburi without any break. i survived and was able to continue with the next portion of the training. miracalously the symptoms disappeared and i felt energized. kendo does wonderful things to the mind and also the body.          "
"       i'm down with flu today. actually it started on monday. the pain was like being on a rack. i took some aspirin and the pain subsided for a day. today the pain is back. i'm still going to training because there'll be a briefing on our duties for the competition on sunday but i still intend to train tonight. am i trying for sepupuku? will just have to see later how much my mental toughness can push my physical self.         "
"       we learnt san dan waza today. combination of  1)kote,men,men 2)men,men,men 3)kote,men,kote training as always is very tiring but the feeling at the end is satisfying. however today i felt as if we were not pushed as hard as wednesday and that is kind of unsatisfying. contradicting my statements aren't i. i have decided on a physical training system which will supplement my learning of kendo. hopefully at the end of a month, i will be fitter and will want more torturing session from peter sansei.         "
"       training was a killer today. we moved our training sessions to the court upstairs. knowing the humidity and heat, i was sweating buckets. one point during training i had to stop, ask peter sansei for permission to leave the dojo to vomit. he once said that training would be hard and if we needed to vomit we should do it outside the dojo. it would be a hassle and also disrespectful to do it in the dojo. i did exactly that, felt guilty of leaving the class momentarily.i vomited and then asked permission to join the class again. i felt better after relievinng myself so i joined in again and suffered more horrendous torture after that.         "
"       a group of us have been given the go ahead to purchase our bogu. we had to earn it. 100 jogeburi, 100 shomenuchi, 100 sayumen and 150 hayasuburi. our forms were scrutinised and those who met the criteria were allowed to order the bogu. the sweat and sore arms was definitely worth it.         "
"       sunday is training day. will have to learn several commands as i'm up for duty for the singapore national kendo championships. maybe i'll try to get a video camera so that i can have a personal copy of the event. will be very exciting. still waiting for the say sansei starts the nihonkendokata.         "
"       i felt very foreign with my shinai. must be the fact that i've not picked it up since sunday. read about a blog by a guy whose main goal is to do 1000 suburi every two days for a week. maybe i should try that. training was ok tiring but manageble. we practised men cuts with partners 'motodachi' no 'shidachi' as we are all beginners. will need to practise my kihon to perfect my shomenuchi jogeburi.         "
"       i've started pair work. hitting shinai's is much different than hitting air. almost missed my fellow kendoka's shinai. need more practise on this.         "
"       haya suburi can make you see stars. exactly what i experienced three training sessions ago. almost fainted, almost gave up, but i endured, ego not letting me do so. i will endure and make kendo an essential part or my life. good news, i've been given the ok to buy my bokken. nihonkendokata will be starting in another two or three weeks. only 6 so far out of 27 have been given the ok. i'm very proud of myself.         "
"       a month filled with kihon. footwork is essential. suburi is essential. all building blocks of life long kendo. as peter sansei would say 'when you step into the dojo, leave everything outside, instead after training take what you have learned out with you and make it part of your life.'         "
"       i had to go through a selection process. kiai was very critical to passing the selection. in the beginning i thought that race gender and physical conditioning would tip the balance of the selection and i would not get in. but peter sansei proved me wrong. the skc proved me wrong. it was one of those days that you were happy that you were wrong for once.         "
"       it has been exactly one month since i began my journey. the art of the living sword first took me in believe or not from a hollywood movie. the character played by ken watanabe was so powerful. a great man, an excellent actor. the potrayal of the culture of the people practising the art of the living sword was very well done. that movie made me look for it.           "
"       i have practice today. deep down in me i know that twice a week of training is inadequate. i need to train at home, but the low ceiling is a hindrance. i cannot even do men at home. i've asked the seniors for help, they advised me to cut a shinai so that it is adequate to clear my ceiling. i only have one shinai...i guess i need to get another. my target is my next pay day but i have a lot to save for and i hope i can squeeze my budget for an additional 40 dollars for a new shinai.         "
"       i wore the gi and hakama for the first time today. heavy and tight at the chest area. but very free at the legs. surprisingly it gave me very good posture and i felt more control in my suburi. well that is until before fatigue sets in. needs to strengthen my body and mind. well no more procrastinating my goal is to lose excess weight so that i can tie a bow knot at the back instead of a reef knot. tomorrow is day one of exercise and diet regime.         "
"       peter sensei returned after a two session hiatus. we have also two students who are singaporeans studying in australia. they have been doing kendo since january so they are slightly ahead of us. with peter sensei back, training sessions are now back to normal. disciplined, and very challenging. this is something which i prefer. traditional kendo is what i'm trying to find. ultimately before the end of this life i'll be able to find a sensei who is able to teach kenjutsu. anyway we have been given the go ahead to wear the gi and hakama the next session. unfortunately for me i'll be on an educational trip next session so i'll have to miss that training session though. will read up on how to wear it in ozawa's book, 'kendo the definitive guide'. i also did some maintenance on my shinai. it was becoming lose so i dismantled it, looked up shinai maintenance on the net and then followed the instructions.   1)  urlLink Shinai Maintenance homepage          "
"       peter sensei was absent today. michael sensei took over. he has a totally different teaching style and he was more forgiving than peter sensei. we hit actual men cuts on the advanced class today. finally getting the feeling of actually cutting an opponent wearing bogu. training was not that tiring. somehow or rather when peter sensei is around, we are pushed to our limits more. hopefully we will see him on sunday, no matter how dreadful our training session might end up.

"       my return to training has not been an easy one. i've lost the stamina that i had before the accident, my suburi is a total mess and i'm feeling the after effects of the accident every day. i'm physically slower, easily confused and light -headed frequently. i tried to keep up&nbsp;during last wednesday's training. despite the fact that it was easier, i was panting away. i need to get back into shape fast. maybe absolution is the key. during this sunday's east west tournament i totally disappointed myself and my team with my lacklustre suburi which was a random mess of poor coordination and bad tenouichi. i have to try harder.            "
"       watching kendo is not&nbsp;fun. for the past two weeks i've been at the dojo for every training session. with my injuries i could not join the class eventhough i wanted so much to be with them. i still cannot sit&nbsp;&nbsp;in seiza position and sonkyo is very painful. i've made my mind to start on wednesday and peter sensei was kind enough to allow me &nbsp;to seat cross legged during seiza. i will be with them wednesday and my kiai&nbsp;will echo&nbsp;in the dojo once again.&nbsp;            "
"       i met with a motorcycle accident on monday last. i was with my fiancee at that time.thank god, we escaped with abrasions from road burns. my bike was totalled...gone... and will need at least 10000 dollars in repair.i went down to kendo training with my injuries on wednesday and was given the green light from peter sensei to sit down and rest. my fiance was with me throughout the training session. she looks interested and she said she is confident in being able to do what the other female kendokas are doing. she thinks she might give it a try. well who knows i might be training with her soon? (the accident reminds me of director 'beat takeshi', who had a motorcycle accident too. director/actor zatoichi.)         "
"       i had comments from fellow kendokas from around the world. they gave me some ggod advice about how to cope with practicing suburi in low ceiling conditions. if not a shinai would have been sacrificed to a saw. thanks a million. we practised our fundamentals today. i enjoyed myself becauase training was hard. my kiai personally has also improved. i really think the way of the living sword is for me. with all this hardship, we learn humility, friendship, honor and most important respect for others and oneself. i will give it my all and not look back.

"                 So many things I could talk about today. Didn't get to talk to my Daddy, left him a message though. Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though. I think I will eat something really bad for me now so I can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!  Cheers!       "

He was going on about how they make good belts.

Holy molaaaaay I need more coffee or a brain or a Greek Belt?  Cheers      "

"                 Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along. The WB's Superstar USA, ooooh man I LOVE that show. An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his 'gah-dunk-a-dunk' that made him star material. (that means his butt for those not in the know **wink**) Mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school. Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there. I do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided. I missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and have tried to find more info on how the show went down. A few comments here and there online only to find that JAIME WON!!! UGHHHH!!! NOOOOOOO!!!! For gawd sakes do we NOT have enough female pop-TARTS out there these days?? Yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she can't sing. I think we needed someone like Mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants. Rosa well....yeah the worst singer but she didn't have the spark and she can't shake it like J-Lo and Aguilera. Jo-Jo was just too sweet I think, or too simple....I dunno one or the other. Apparently it works for a woman but not for a man. Yay Jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardom,but for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands!!!  Cheers!      "
"                 We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation, but how does that really affect us? All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's. A couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today. Always searching for the youth, the secret of eternal life....dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so...'Geriatrics' I love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age, she was born in 1918 the year Influenza B swept across North America and killed so many. Indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old. Grandma was sent to stay with Aunt Lizzie till her Ma was better. She managed to stay well through that. She also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids. In a house with no running water. I think about how my child will never know what it's like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchen(well those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe). My grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life....brought 4 kids into this world on Dairy Farms. Worked hard..watched her family grow...watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes. He passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man. Then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids, and most importantly her garden. That woman has more strength and courage than most of the people I know. And as I watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86...I find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life. We all will die one day. So I am not sure if I am more upset at the fact she will not be here forever...or the fact that I won't. I need coffee...Cheers!      "
"                 There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to. Sometimes my ideas seem profound, sometimes just plain funny....maybe getting it all out there and have someone stumble across them and maybe laugh, maybe cry, maybe learn something...might be a good idea. Or I can just pretend people actually are interested in my errant rantings now and then. So I raise a glass of....hrmm...water? and say Cheers!  Webi      "
"                 that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee. Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wienerrrrrrrr....everybody'd be in love with me.   I treated myself today to some dresses, I felt so gross the last week. I realized I had only one really 'pretty' dress..I am a girl I guess I can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like I have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure. I'd like to be able to look in the mirror and say 'Daaaamn I look GOOD!' and really think it. For all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks...I need to be less critical about what I think of them. I know the really good stuff is on the inside, I know how to love, I know how to care, I know how to make others feel appreciated...But I live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty. I did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations...dammit if I lived in the time of Reuben...I'd be a SuperModel...lol. We are taught young to find fault with ourselves...our lack of looking like that less than 1% of women who actually do model. I still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things. There would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model...or models chosen on the basis of their deeds...cause in the end it's how good you WERE not how good you LOOKED.   &nbsp;  I had more to say but I got distracted, so yeah then I guess I am done for now.   Cheers!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;          "
"                 that's all i want to say to youuuuu.  &nbsp;  Ok maybe not just that. I got a lot done today, fever seems to be almost gone. Had most of the day to myself which was kind of nice. Did some yard work,a lot of&nbsp;cleaning, some resting...then got a phone call that my precious was not comfy where she was having a sleep over and wanted to come home. That's ok though we can try another time.  &nbsp;  I'm a little nervous about going back to work, but I still have a bit more time. I will go back to needing to catch up on so much and take account for the time and targets I missed. I think it's going to be ok, I feel like i have a better sense of purpose now. Maybe I just need to get primal and kill that fear. Funny how a slight change in the way you perceive something can shift you to a whole other view.&nbsp; Although I don't think being painted up in tribal colors and jumping on the desks will go over well at work...ooooh wait that's right METAPHORICAL...lol  &nbsp;  Ok I am done..nothing else to say today.  &nbsp;  Cheers  &nbsp;         "
"                 I am a candle burning bright, to light your way on darkest nights Your path you choose, You take your steps I hold your hand along the way, and raise you up from broken wings You find your voice, You sing your song I hear your soul, and sing along &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  um yeah it was there waiting...now it is in words        "
"                 so much and so much and so much...  I am happy that I have started to take the time to learn more about why and how I react to things.  Accept a challenge now and then, learn from how I react to them too. And through all of it....remember I can do anything I set my mind to. I have felt like there were times in my life when I dragged myself with my finger nails to get through...but hey...whatta ya know?!?! I made it...and I will keep moving forward. I can feel the energy in the core of my being, maybe I should try to bask in it more often.   I have so many thoughts on so many different topics today. I can say this, BRING IT!   Cheers!       "
"                 I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago, thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though. Too bad it never found it's way to anyone who appreciated it though lol.  If Time was a River  If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd need someone steadfast to be on my crew And if I had get to choose, I plan to choose you   Ok that's not exactly the original but not bad if I do say so myself. I should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog...might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane.  I was actually missing work today, but know I am not ready to go back just yet. A couple more weeks and I should feel better able to face the world head on again. It's been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me, but then I think about all those people I am not getting to help. I sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my co-workers have...then again so many people in the world are apathetic. When I get to hear 'wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me?' or 'You are a dear you took all my worries away' at least I know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone, somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed. Someone told me I had too much to give one time, isn't that what it's about though?? You give of yourself to the right people...and they give back to you...not rocket science yannow? Or give the right things to the right people. I almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to...instead of feeling like you constantly are going to 'owe' something to someone.   Cheers!      "
"                 Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you. We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers      "

"       I'm at work eating lunch right now. A turkey scamich and a 'Courage' Sobe, those commies don't have Green Tea in the machine.   I have been thinking about writing another game but don't know what to write. I thought about doing a combat clone (like the old atari 2600 combat tank game) but that is a little too basic. A big problems I have with making games is my lark of a real artist. I gave up on my Rolling Thunder(tm) style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen.  I want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff, but that's probably because I've had Zelda on the brain recently. I wonder if the Zelda games are named specifically after Zelda Fitzgerald...I guess I'll never know.  I like top down shooters, maybe I'll make another one of those. Earth Defender B was kinda lame, though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects.   For the people reading what kind of 2D game would you like to see, maybe a puzzle game? I don't know.         "
"       Well,I just got out of my last class of the semester. The final wasn't that hard except for one problem that I didn't do because I didn't even know where to start. The only class I'm worried about is Linear Algebra, or as it should be called 'Hard ass shit that I'll never remember and barely understand in the first place'. Man, I thought Calc 2 was tough. I'll take problems dealing with the surface area of graphs rotated into 3-space any day over these problems.   I really hope I get a C or B in this class. If I did worse on the final than I though then I could get a D. If that happens then this semester is a total waste. I need so many more math classes than anything else that to not pass one puts off my graduation by one more semester. The fact that I can't take any math classes this summer semester is, for me, a total travisty. Add to that the fact that I can't take ANY classes this summer and I'm pretty bummed about that. I was hoping to at least be able to take another yoga class or a programming class, or an art class. But no, nothing fits my work schedual.   I feel like I should want to party because I'm done with school for a little while but I really don't. As much as I can't stand individual people I like to be around people in general and school is a great way to do this. Now I'll have nothing to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I guess I could look for another job for the summer, but that would be lame too. OHH SHIT!! I got it, I can try being a dealer at a casino,I've always wanted to do that. Man that would be so sweet, I would be standing there and be all like 'Sir would you like to hit or stand...' and he would say 'Hit me' and I would give him another card and then I would probably say 'Ohh Sorry sir, I guess you shouldn't have hit' and then I'll take his money.  The only problem is that the only casino within driving distance (for me) is Casino San Pablo and playing blackjack there is like playnig golf underwater, it doesn't work the way it's supposed to and it just isn't fun.   Well, now I don't have anything to do for several hours. Ohh well, maybe I should just be depressed about it or something...         "
"       I can't believe that no one has commented on my Zelda post. Surely I'm not the only one that sees not only one, but the prospect of TWO new Zelda games as momentous news. Hmm...there is indeed something wrong with this world.   I was much later for work than normal today, my alarm clock may be broke or something. It better wake my ass on time for my comparitive politics final tomorrow.   I brought home a broken Palm m515 (or some similar model number) from work today with high hopes to take it apart and finally get a part I need to fix my Palm Zire 71. After 30 minutes of using various tools to break apart the Palm I finally extracted the tiny ribbon cable that I needed only to find that the connector on one end is different. What a bunch of damn communazi jerks. I was so let down. I wasn't even mad (at first). Oh well, it's not like I'll die without a PDA.          "
"       Yesterday I was driving somewhere and Mongolia crossed my mind. I realized that I knew nothing at all about the country. I have a vague notion that at one point in history mongol hordes swept across the land killing a bunch of people and stuff, but after they got beat back did they just become hermits? When was the last time you rememberanything happeneing there, or them doing anything at all in the world? Never.   After Mongolia I started thinking about Portugal. You never hear anything about Portugal either. I can understand Mongolia, it's way the hell out of the way near Siberia. It may even be part of Russia or China these days. But Portugal, man they're right there on the edge of Europe. I never hear anything, and I mean anything about portugal. I remember talking about WWII in school. We leraned that Spain was neutral during the war, we knew about how pretty much every European country stood, every one aside from Portugal. What happened to them, did they just vanish after the age of exploration....has anyone bothered to check!!! Since I'm obviously on the internet right now I know that I  could  just read about these places, but that would be too easy.   I think it's time that T.V. started informing us about countries that it doesn't really talk about already. We need to hear about Mongolia, Portugal, Estonia, and others I don't know that name of because I never hear about them. STOP THE GEOGRAPHICAL ELITISM.         "
"       I've just checked out the page for the new  Zelda  game and I have to say that I can't wait for it to come out. After the big pile of dog poo that was the Ledgend of the Windwaker I'm so glad that they decided to make the Zelda game that people want, not try to reinvent the series as a cartoon that you play.   At first, when looking at the screenshots, I was a little confused. I thought 'Hey, these are screenshots of 'A link to the past''. Then I realized that there wern't four Links in that game. However this game does indeed use many of the same graphics that were used in 'Link to the Past'. Hopefully it will also include the dark world and stuff, though this game looks prettty triforce free. Well, I guess you can't have everything, even though I really really would like to have the Triforce of wisdom....hint hint...   Oh yeah, stuff has happened in my life since yesterday, but it hardly seems worth talking about considering this Zelda news.   UPDATE: I have learned that there is another Zelda game  in the works . This one is 3D and looks like it will give little kinds and grown-ups alike nightmares that will put them off sleep for days. Just check out the screenshots, the one with Link fighting the GIANT ASS DEMON looked scarey as hell. I saw that guy and figured it had to be all over for Link, I really don't see how the little guy can pull off a victory aginst what looks like a 5 story building of a demon. Ohh man, I can't wait for this shit.....I wish I could freeze myself in carbonite or something untill this shit comes out.         "
"        Read this and rejoice (unless you live in South Carolina)   That's right folks, coming soon to a South Carolina near you, Christian Fundamentalism!!! They plan to break away from the nation to form an independant christian country, lets all pray that they get it. I'm sick of my federal tax dollars going to other states and having them still look down on California, it's like 'Hey assholes, we may have a screwy economy but we're still the piggy bank of the nation, where do you think you get your farm subsidies? Stalin Claus?'. Shit, we're (California) like the ugly step-child of the US, we give all our money and get back insults in return. Well it's time to rejoice that one of the other jerk states is going to bail. As an added bonus they are supposedly taking 50,000 nutjobs away from other states. Woohoo! You're going to stop taking our money and remove a bunch of nutjob chiristian fundamentalists...man...can I donate to your cause?         "
"       Well, I guess I lied. I have been updating this blog, more even than the others I know with blogs update theirs. I guess I should have called it 'Don't read my boring ass blog that has bad spelling and doesn't have any updates you will care to read because I never really do anything important anyways.', but that title seems a bit long.  Before I forget I'd like to give a big shoutout to  Isabella Wunder  for linking to me, though she could have used slightly better link text than 'Boring Ass' but I guess you have to take it how it comes. I'd also like to give a big shout out to  Miss Macy  and  Ember  I guess the Benicia crew is in da house or off the hook something.   Reguarding my dreams, it seems that my sunconscious picked up on my distaste for my recent dreams and game me a little treat last night. I had a dream I was playing a dope ass team based FPS similar to Tribes but with really good graphics and you could control players with your mind. However it wasn't all good, I had to put the game system together before I could play the game and even then my step dad was watching the whole time grunting about wanting to watch tv. Damn...don't get any peace anywhere...         "
"       Lately I've been having the more boring lame dreams ever. Being stuck trying to turn right at a country road stopsign, trying to play pool but not being able to find a pool que, arguing with someone about the use of mercenaries in the war in Iraq.  While I'm sure that all this is just dripping with deep meaning and insight both into my own mind and into the true nature of human society I just with that the way this insight were conveyed was a little more interesting or exciting. Why can't I have dreams where I'm superman or something and I just fly around and save people....that would be so rad.  Anyways, my subconscious mind aparently wants me to know that hiring mercenaries in Iraq is cheaper than sending our own troops because we don't have to pay for six months of training, during which time we have no extra troops. I hadn't thought about this point before having it told to me in a dream, odd that a part of me is spending time thinging about arguemnts to support things I'm against. What a jerk.         "
"       Sometimes I fancy myself as a fiction writer. And since fiction is more interesting than describing  the fact that I took some test yesterday or that I talked to someone the I hadn't seen in a while I  guess I can write some here and have almost no one read it anyway.   I removed the story I was writing, it was leaving the realm of bloggable short story and entering the realm of longish tale. Plus it was boring and uninspired. I still like the idea of the story with only really reflects the experiances I've had in office work.   It's funny how you got to places and everything seems to run smoothly, but then you get a job there and you realize that it's like one big balancing act and it's amazing that everything doesn't come crashing down all the time. My favorite was when I work in customer service. Man, I didn't know crap about the products people were asking me about, no one did. Ohh well.          "
"       I just read this story and I have to say that I don't normally get this pissed of at the sad state of affairs anymore, but this one really got me going. It seems that this principal fancies hiseld as the thought police for the school. One person wrote a poem he doesn't agree with and not only does he call the student un-American, fires the teacher that sponsers the poetry club, terminates the teaching of poetry in the school but also removes all student art from the walls of the school and doesn't renew the contracts of teachers that leave art in their classrooms. I can't believe that this commie has the nerve to call someone un-American.          "
"       Unluckily for you you have somehow landed here, on my blog. I fail to grasp why one would want to read my blog, however I have to admit that I don't exactly have the most favorable view of blogs that can be had. I have been known to say, and still say that they are one of the biggest wastes of time known to man, and one that offers the fewest rewards. So, why then am I posting this? Well, for two reasons; one, I wanted to post comments on another blog that doesn't allow anonymous comments, and two, I'm the one wasting your time. I have to think about my life anyways, now I'm making you do it too.....ha ha, sucker.           "
"       After reading  this  news story I knew I had to write about it for a couple different reasons. First off, as long as she isn't butt ugly I doubt many boys were very thrown by this punishment. I know I know, it damages them physomindaly or something but come on, how many boys alreay have little fantasys about their teachers and now they have one asked if then want to be caned or to suck on her breasts. Man, some guys would shoot their loads just thinking about that setup.   All joking aside it always irks me how little attention is payed to woman on boy sexual abuse. I know this took place in another country but it happens here and it never gets the same kind of media coverage or reaction than when the perpetrator is male.         "
"       It's strange to think that every person is like a walking universe. Every person sees things through their own perspective and with their own thoughts coloring what they see. You would think that with all this uniqueness of thought and perspective going around there would be many different personalities and a real sense of individualism to go with it, but there's not. For as far as people have gone group affiliation still seems to be a driving force in society. It's like once we stopped living in tribes and towns got too large for everyone to know everyone else we had to create tribes of our own, and in order for these tribes to have meaning and consistency in our large society each member of these neo-tribes must conform to an even stricter set of guidelines than would be necessary in an average tribal society.   It's funny how every group seems to think that they are unique and that they are true individuals, however most members of a group almost always dress the same, or at least very similarly. I swear to god that if I see one more of those 'You laugh at me because I am different, I laugh at you because you're all the same' shirts I'm going to barf all over the person wearing it and them that I'm laughing at them because they think they're 'different' while wearing a shirt that could have it's own wearers convention I've seen so many people wearing it.   Every person has the capacity to have so many interests it's not funny, sometimes I think I bore people to death talking about my own, but I've noticed that many people never seem to have any real interests. It's almost like people are afraid of being kicked out of their neo-tribe if they express an interest in something that none of the others like. Each group has it's own safe area it could be literature, music, clothes, style, whatever, and you will often hear people talking about those things, but not so much about other things.   I think it's important to note that I'm not talking about friends, there is a difference between a group like the neo-tribe that I'm talking about, and a group of friends. It's also important to note that my friends kick ass and that I'm not talking about any of them.  However, I am talking about many people I do to school with at DVC. It's strange to walk around campus and hear people talking about the dumbest most meaningless shit. It's even stranger to try to talk with people and try to talk about meaningful things, not like the meaning of life or anything just about things that actually interest people (what they plan to do after school, where they grew up, hobbies...), and have them get all uncomfortable and leave. I don't know if people think I'm hitting on them or what but almost every time I talk to someone like an adult with full comprehension abilities rather than talk to them like they are children (how are you? I like your hat? the sky is nice...) they end up looking at me like I'm nuts.  The other end of that spectrum are people that try to talk about the craziest thing they can to prove how different they are. Somehow these people annoy me even more than people that talk about nothing because it just seems that they are forcing something that isn't there. It would be as if I talked about the goatse man with everyone I met.           "
"       This is kind of a continuation of a previos story line in my blog and has to do with my job. If my readers will remember I have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when I came to work today to find a 'Spirit Award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? The best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and I got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was I surprised.          "
"       I've been working on my new game for a little while now it's coming along okay. I have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code. Recently I've been working on implementing a 2D SDL based particle engine. I've had a few problems because unless I use single pixels for particles I can't figure out how to color them. So I would have to have different particles drawn in each color I would want , or have all particles be the same color. It's so much easier to do in OpenGL. Half the game effects I have planned are particle effects so if I can't figure out how to do them in SDL I may have to do the partiels in OpenGL, I know there is a way to use OpenGL with an SDL window, I just han't read up on how yet.   Right now I'm working on this game less than any others I have worked on in the past. By this point in time on my missile command clone I had already finished an OpenGl particle engine and setup all the particle effects I would use in that game. My lack of work is mostly because I spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else, aside from sleeping and 'working'.   I need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds, that way I could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere. But it's too much work shuffeling code around all the time, and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files. If the USB on my home computer actually worked I guess I could just use a thumb drive to move things around. But alas it does not work. ASUS makes some great boards, but this one isn't exactly the greatest. Maybe I should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system. Hmmmm....my birthday is coming and a nice new ASUS board with a gig of RAM would look mighty fine under the tree. With a nice P4, ohh man, that would be so sweet. The only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with TWO nice P4s nad TWO gigs of RAM and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive.   Well, time to go play some pool I guess.  At least I did write a few lines of code today.         "
"       Yesterday was, all in all, a pretty good day. Even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didn't give me money for gas or the bridge. I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date.   I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end. I woke up, went to Kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament. I ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of $35. Not too shabby considering that I got lucky in quite a few games. But that's just the way it goes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you...I guess I got it last night, but it wont be long before it gets me back. What a jerk.   I ended the night be getting a sticky Sobe from Wolves and talking to Miss Macy for a little bit. I went home, played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep, something which I failed miserably at. It's now the morning of today and I got about one or two hours of sleep. I guess the bear did get me back...while I was in bed, he is a jerk!         "
"       Well, today is my last day of forced vacation from work and I'm kinda glad to go back because the heat is killing me. I wanted to do more with the past week then just hand out like normal. But It's hard to find people that want to get out and do stuff early in the day, especially when you're not so sure you want to yourself. Is it getting hotter!!! It's 4:00pm, I figured it would start cooling off but my house defies me again and shows it self for the oven that it is. Roasted griffenjam is on the menu tonight.   I got the new Zelda game, Four Swords Adventures, last week. It came with a free shirt and I'm wearing it now, for the third time this week, I did wash it yesterday though so that is no excuse to stay away  from me. The game is alot like the new Harry Potter movie. It's really good for what it is, but don't try to compare it to anything else in the series (or in the movies case the book) because it just wont live up. In practice it's very much like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Which was the worst Final Fantasy game ever. The thing I hat...dislike the most is that you cant just walk around the world at your leisure. You have to select a specific are to go to, then select an available section, and clear it to move on to the next area. I don't like games that are too controlling, let me do my own thing dammit.   A Link to the Past kicks this games ass so hard the bruises may never go away, but like I said, it's fun for what it is.    My, and Isabella's, birthday is coming up soon. I'm wondering if my dad will call, I doubt he will but I hope he does. It's normally pretty easy to milk an absent parent for good gifts or cash, as long as they feel bad about being absent. However I didn't even get a card for Christmas so I think that I may be out of luck. I wonder what the etiquette is with crappy dads when it comes to the rest of the family. My Grandmother, his mom, is having everyone at her house for her birthday soon and I was invited. I want to go, but I don't know. I always get the feeling that I'm a little set apart from them, except for Grandma.   For example, I'm the only liberal in a very conservative family, I'm also the only non-baptized one. I also know that if I go I'll just get even more mad at my dad than I already am. Like last time I went up. Some cousins and I were playing softball and then one of them said something about playing softball with my dad recently. This was funny because my dad lives in Arizona and she doesn't. That means that my dad came to California and at some point played softball with her (something he hasn't done with me) and never even called me. Before that day I thought it was the entire family that he ignored but during that trip I found out that it was just me. Everyone kept asking me about what I thought about things he's been up to or have happened to him. All of it was news to me. Ohh well, what can I do, but if he thinks he's getting my liver or any other organ someday he can think again.           "
"       I don't want to make a habit of posting news stories but  this  is one I felt I just had to share. It would seem that in the year 2003, the second full year of our all out war on terrorism, the amount of terrorism used in the world actually increased. They tried to lie about it and say that the level of terrorism had dropped lower than it has been in 34 years, but someone called them on it and now they look pretty dumb.   This is exactly what I have been saying will happen. A war on terrorism will only increase the number of people that are willing to use it to acheive their aims.          "
"       Okay. So, in my last post I said I had a meeting with my boss that I thought was going to be bad. It was. Due to my non-stop lateness and over the top internet useage I've been suspended for two days. While I think that suspension was a little harsh I could use a little time off. The only thing that bugs me is that I'm not the only one in my department that does this stuff. I'm just the most obvious one. Hell one person plays flash games all day. Another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work. Ohh well, I guess that's what it means to be low man on the totem pole.   Enough about that, now it's time to tell about me being hasseled by the man. The other night I was driving home from playing some pool and I see a cop driving around, I say to Isabella, 'He's going to pull me over'. Low and behold he does. I wasn't doing anything wrong, nothing at all. He tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired. Just to make it totally clear, I had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the DMV computers right in their car I find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired. He eventually lets me go.  Last night, just two nights after the first incident, after leaving a pool tournament (which I didn't win) I see a cop, and he sees me walking to my car. He pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me, then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight. He's out of sight for all of five seconds and I see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute. The second I drive off he's on my ass. I  LOVE  it when cops tailgate me! So I try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end I kinda do. I'm at a red light and and I see a car coming but it looks far enough away that I think I can safely turn right. The cop didn't agree. He pulled me over and asked for my license. This piqued my interest because he didn't ask for my registration. I would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it, but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didn't ask for it. He just told me to yeild next time and let me go.   God I love the cops in Benicia. I live in Vallejo and drive around that city all the time, at all hours but never get pulled over there. I go one town over and it happens quite often.          "
"       I have a meeting with my boss in about 10 minutes. I always hate meeting with authority figures. I have a feeling that this will be bad. It's a follow up to a meeting I had previously with her when we discussed how late I always am, I've been late alot lately. In my defense I've been sick lately and it's harder to get up and around early when you're sick. I don't know how to tell her that without sounding like I'm just making excuses, which is something I really don't want to do. I guess it doesn't matter really. This place isn't known for handing out raises so it's not like I'm going to miss a chance at a raise because I'm a bad employee, and I don't think I'm quite fireable yet. Though that would really suck. I'd hate to have to turn to selling my body to pay rent.         "
"       It's funny how much time can change you without you realizing it. When I was 17 I had the world figured out; I was the person I really wanted to be and couldn't imagine ever wanting to change. I was going race people on the feeway with my VW Bug for the rest of my life. I was going to do other things too, but I was sure that racing my bug was going to be a big part of my life forever. Well, two accudent later I no longer had a bug to race and it's really hard to look like a straigt up hardcore pimp driving a Bonneville (and it was so easy in a VW Bug!).   Now that I have a car that can race I find that I never actually want to do it. Maybe I'm just afraid that I'll get in a wreck and die, I mean how fast could I really go in a VW Bug?    Heh, actually it's funny for how much one changes, how much of them stays the same. I remember when I was young, maybe in third grade, I used to be afraid that when I grew older I would turn into someone else. That somehow the voice inside my head would be different and not connected to the one I had at that time. I was afraid of being older, like 15 or 16, I didn't know how to do it then. It all seemed very scarey. I would be expected to do things and know things about the world. Like how to pay taxes and register cars. I would be expected to know how to SPELL!!! Well, I guess I can't get everything right. When I made it to 15 the last thing I wanted was to be 18. There were breif moments when I wanted the freedom that being 18 would bring but those moments didn't last long. I didn't have a large college fund, $1000 doesn't even go far at community college, and I knew that none of my parents would be kicking down the many thousands that it would take to send me to school. I also knew that my grades weren't good enough to merrit and kind of scholership worth talking about. This all ment that I would have to work for a living when I turned 18 (which actually turned out to be when I was 16) and even thought I hadn't done it yet I knew one thing anout work, it was for suckers. Ten jobs later I have only confirmed that, work really is for suckers.   I know that a blog is supposed to be like a diary. A log of events in your life, but I find my typical day to be too mundane to talk about. I don't mean to diminish the importance I place on hanging out with my friends thought. I saw a few of my friends yesterday and last night and I really enjoy it every time I'm around my friends. Whether it's going to the mall and getting a bit to eat or sitting around shooting pool and trying to win stuffen animals the time I spend with my friends is the most important time in my life. That is something that has never changed about me and I hope that it never does.         "
"       I just got back from see the new Harry Potter movie and I guess I'll say some words about it. I wont try to spoil anything but if your looking to be surprised then dont read this post (like anyone reads these posts anyways).   Overall I thought the movie was good for what it was however it pays the book absolutely no service at all. Some events are out of order, happen in entirely different places, or are completely missing. Unless it was after the credits the trainride home wasn't even in the movie and that means that pidwidgen (spelling?) wasn't either, sorry Ron I guess Errol will have to do for now.   Quiddich was completely forgotten about after the first match, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to seeing Harry's patronus run down Malfoy. Actually many things arn't in the movie at all, which I was expecting but it seems that too much is missing.   Time also seems to move very quickly. Before you know it it's christmas time, but strangely enough it never actually is christmas. It seems that opening presants on christmas is a feature of every book, but it didn't make it into the movie. Sorry guys, no sweaters from Mrs. Weasley or any  other preasents .   One thing I was sorry wasn't in the movie was the lack of normal interaction. You never really see the students in class unless there is a major event in that class. The books deal not only with the main story line but also with the life of Harry and his friends in school, this is something that is completely missing from the movie.   I still liked it none the less.         "
"       All my life I've had lucid dreams, dreams which you can control, however when I have them it's fairly rare that I realize that I'm dreaming at the time. Ladt night is a perfect example. I had a dream that I was arrested for some reason and thrown into jail, this was a lucid dream, however it's hard to take control when you don't realize that you have any; I thought it was real. I was totally freaking out, wondering what the hell was happening. However it was that bad because every time I wanted anything I would find it right away. I was a little thirsty and instantly found a coke machine, I wanted something to do and found a rec-room filled with pool tables. I wanted something to eat and I just all of a sidden had food, I don't even know where it came from. After a little while it turned out that I was in the coolest jail ever. Somehow I missed that fact that there was a surprisingly small number guys in this jail and the majoiry of the population was filled with hot girls. How did I not reailze that I was dreaming.   I'm staying home from work today, my sickness I mentioned before has not gone away and I figure that if I have to deal with it for a while I may as well take a day of work. This sucks more than is immedatly apperent to anyone that doesn't work for communists. At the hospital I for at your sick time and your paid vacation all come out of the same bucket. The time I'm taking now is subtracting from my paid vacation time....that is so lame it makes me even sicker. It's actually a very bad policy to have in a hospital. I wonder how many people, in order to conserve vacation time, go to work sick....in a hospital...go to work sick...sick...to their work....their work which is where tons of people are that shouldn't be around anyone that is sick that they don't have to be. Ohh well, I don't make the rules, I just try my best to not follow them.   I saved some of the best news for last. Last night I won a pool tournament. Brought in a wooping $69. Woohoo! Actually I got quite lucky, and you can believe me when I say that because I think false modesty is one of the fakest things since McDonalds cheeseburgers. It really rips me up when I know that someone is trying to be modest and saying things I know they really don't think.  Well, I have to go, I told Isabella and MaterialGirl that I would come hang with them.  Don't do anything I wouldn't do....and if you do call me first so I can come and watch...         "
"       As you may have noticed by the fact that it is plainly stated above, I am in a bad mood. I couldn't sleep at all last night and when I did drift off for a short period of time I had a strange dream about  Optimus Prime and I hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital I work in. It seemed that most of the Autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us. Optimus wasn't in high spirits and neither was I.   So, I'm tired and cranky and I have a sore throat and so when I got to work I decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day. Budget cuts at school have now hit home for me. There is a greatly decreased number of Tuesday/Thursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arn't teaching the classes I need to take, which is okay because the classes arn't at time I can take them anyways.   Why is it patriotic to blindly support every war Bush takes us into but it's okay to let education funding slide. Wanna talk about patriotism, how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change. Our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that don't care about funding education.   I was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but I just got blindsided by my bad day. I need to talk to a counselor about what classes I can take for my major now that I can't take the math class I need or the programming class I need.          "
"           Last sunday was the anniversary of the day of my birth. It's not a global holiday yet, but I'm working on it. I had a pretty good time. I had gone to Lake Tahoe with my parents, my sister and her husband. I won some money on the first night I was there, that was pretty cool. We went to Nevada and saw some sights, including the town that Bonanza was filmed in. Then we came back and went out on a dinner cruise in the lake. It was pretty cool. The food was alright except for the fact that no matter how anyone ordered the steak it came out medium well. But considering that it also came out within five minutes of ordering it I have an inkeling that it may have been already cooked and would have been hard to uncook it a little to make it med. rare.         The boat sports a small glass bottom that is too small to be of any use to anyone that isn't just trying to check on the color of the water under the boat.  But it was a nicvee trip altogether and I enjoyed the views of the lake. I took lots of pictures, as people normally do in that kind of setting, then in five years I'll probably do what countless others have done, I'll look at those pictures and wonder where the hell they were taken and what exactly I was taking a picture of, because aside from trees and water there is nothing remarkable in the pictures.         After we got back we all went gambling. The idea was to go together but we ended up going our seperate ways after long. I did well but wasn't making the millions I wanted to so I quit and walked to a pub that sports a pool table and figured I'd shoot a couple games. This was a great decision it turns out, because I met two very nice girls from Oakland in the pub. We shot a few games then decided to go gamble a little, but on the way to the casino stopped off at a club called the Cabo Yabo or something or other. Now, I don't drink, smoke, or have sex with everyone I meet so the clubs have never really been my thing but we were having a good time none-the-less. I turned 26 standing in that club. We stayed there for a little over an hour then went to do some gambling. I lost a little money ($6.50). And at 2:30am figured that it was time to go to bed. I bid my new friends farewell and left for the warm, if not lsightly stiff, embrace of my bed in my temporary home. I should have gotten their numbers but I didn't. Ohh well, maybe I'll see them again.          In the morning I went to a breakfast buffet with my family and had a pretty good breakfast. After that we gambled a little more, I lost thirty dollars. Then everyone left, one group at a time, with me leaving last. I came home ans went out with some friends to a local bar. Aparentally I spent the whole night muggin' (staring in a menacing way) people, or so I was told, repeatadly.            "
"       For those that don't know, and since everyone that reads this knows me I'm talking to no one that's likely to see this, I play in a pool tournament every thursday night. Last week I did pretty bad, the word dismal comes to mind. Losing is one thing, but missing a bunch of easy shots is another. To put it plainly; I just plain sucked.  However this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because I came out swinging this time and I was dropping fools like that's what they were made for.  Well, I guess I could remember it that way if I were drinking or doing some heavy drugs. In reality I got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person I was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave.  My luck ran out in the last two games. This is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket. This means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket, which is exactly what happened, with a little help from me. For me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game.  The eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and I had a clear shot at it. I took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that I didn't follow it into the side pocket and took my shot. I had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner.  Ohh well, it happens. Sometimes I feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways.  And that's all I have to say about that.           "
"           So, today I did stupid shit like waking up and going to work and coming home and stuff, then I did something pretty cool. I went to see some bands play at Blakes in Berkeley.  I ended up going by myself which is cool with me, but stuff like this is always more fun with friends. Ohh well, at least no one I know saw me jogging down telegraph trying to find a place with a public bathroom I could take a crap in and not die from some disease five minutes later.         I got there rather early and the show started rather late, which ment that I did alot of standing around outside by myself before the show started. Yet again, I don't mind being alone. My dislike for humanity as a whole compells me to no talk to most other people and since I'm a pretty momentumy person my non-talkingness carries over to pretty much everyone, even people I might like to meet. However this doesn't stop crazy people from talking to me and telling me about how they think that Kurt Cobain was alot like Earnest Hemmingway because both blow their brains out. But figuring that you just have to take it as it comes I just smile and say something like 'Wow, I never saw it that way.'.         The bartender at blakes, the girl that works on the main level, has a very strange thing going on. I normally have a pretty good feeling about what people are like, what kind of person they are and so on, and this girl game me a really strange feeling, but in a good way, kind of like the Buddah or something. I wanted to ask her a bunch of questions and try to figure her out but I figured that some creapy guy in a green hat asking where she grew up and what her favorite color is might seem at best like I'm some creapy guy that is hitting on her, and at worst like some creapy loser that is wearing a strange hat and hitting on her.  She was also cute and smiled alot, I like people that smile at people they don't know, I do it all the time but rarely get one in return.         The first band that played was pretty good. There were from the East Coast and played something that sounded very much like L.A. ska. I don't remember their name though and I didn't care to get their CD I kinda had the feeling that they were jerks. This was confirmed when I saw them mocking the band that played after them, Sputter Doll. Sputter Doll played a great set, I really loved it. I felt kind of bad though because all the other bands were pretty much straight ska bands and here they were playing punk. I  got the feeling that most of the people there weren't really digging on them too much, which is too bad because they sounded great. I wanted to get their new CD but they packed up and left before the band after them finished their set. Which brings me to Warsaw. I got a Warsaw Cd back in '97 and thought they were pretty cool. I had no idea they were still around untill today. They played a great set with a bunch of original sounding ska, and even had someone playing a conch shell in one song. It was great to see all the people dancing and haveing a good time, I know I was. However I really had been hoping to hear some of the songs on the CD I have, but they only played recent stuff.  Ohh well. Like I said, gotta take it like it comes, no use complaining about it.        After they were done I left, I didn't really care to stick around for the next band. I drove to the Pastime to play a little pool. Which is exactly what I did, play a little pool; two games to be exact. Once I got there I realized that I was too tired to stay for long. I played and them came home, sucessfully getting out of Benicia without getting pulled over.              "
"       Last night I was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago, just over ten years ago in fact. It's about the first time I fell in love, or at least thought I did. I'll leave out many of the boring details because I'm told that they, rather than adding depth and interest, just make my stories long and drawn out. I was a youngster staying at a hotel/casino with a parent. This meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever I didn't have shit to do. However I was a horny youngster so I went to hand out by the pool, I didn't have a swimsuit, but I figured that girls probably did. Well, while sitting by the pool I noticed a girl around my age, who actually turned out to be a couple years younger, sitting with her grandparents. She was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way; I couldn't really put my finger on it or figure out why I thought she was so attractive but you don't really questions those things too much do you, if you think someone is hot you don't really care why. Well, being a little wuss I knew that I wouldn't talk to her, especially no in front of her grandparents, so I didn't really think about it. Now, it becomes important to point out that I am, and always have been, a big ice eater. In my earlier years it wasn't uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while, something that I did at exactly this point in my story. I got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down. About five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well, on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was. This shocked the hell out of me because at that point, and to a certain degree to this day, I had the feeling that I was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless I walked into someone or something.   At that moment nothing more came of that. Her grandparents and her eventually got up and left, I had nothing to do so stayed there for a while. There was a view of the river nearby from the pool area, so I checked that out for a while. I eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere. I left the pool area and hit the elevator button, which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area, when I heard someone say hi to me from behind. It was that girl, we talked for a little bit (untill the elevator got there). It turned out she was waiting for her grandparents. When the elevator arrived I really wished I could keep talking to her but I didn't know if I would look crazy if I called up an elevator and didn't get into it so I left. I kicked myself all the way to whereever I went after that.  I did something, ate dinner, blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed. I told my parent that I wanted to go for a walk, which was true. I was told to be back by 10pm. I went back to the pool, mostly because I wanted to see the girl, but also because I enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars, even to this day I can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored. When I got there I found that I was the only one there, I sat down and thought about things for a while, then a door opened and she came out. We talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff. I found out that she was from Seattle and her grandparents lived in Sacramento. I can't remember her name (I'm terrible with names) and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address.  When midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms. I was happy that I had met such a cool person but sad because I knew I would never see her again. I was actually depressed about this for a few days. I wrote in a journal at this time in my life and I'll repete here the advice I wrote in my journal.   If you take the time to get to know the perfect person, at least make sure to get her address.         "
"       Well, I've been working on my new game, Earth Defender C, for the past few weeks. I do it a little at a time, I'm not a very hardcore developer these days. Think I got this far with Earth Defender B within the first two or three days. But this game is going to be better developed and have a special quality that Earth Defender B didn't quite have, this game will be fun to play. Since I don't do much artistically that I can share with others I figure all I really have right now is my games so I'm going to post a screenshot so all can see my fledgeling game in all its glory. Before you start dissing my game, or me, remember this is still very early on and that I'm not an artist. Also the map isn't exactly laid out for looks right now.l..blaa...blaaa, here is the pic.            "
"       Well, I'm trying to sign up for classes and I'm having some problems. It seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes I want are at times I can't take them. I can accept this, for now. So I'm thinking that I will talk to a counselor and see what classes I need that are in times I can take them. So I call up and try to make an appointment. This was my big mistake. I expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense (give advice to students before a semester starts). I was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes. So in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and don't really need help. I was told that I couldn't make an appointment until school actually started, and even then I can only make the appointment once school starts, it would be weeks before I could actually see one.   WTF!!! So they only counsel people that have already made mistakes. Hey, glad you made an appointment to come see me, ohh look at this,  you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester, should have talked to someone before signing up for these, but now it's too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week...  THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! Why only help people after it's too late for the help to do any good! Why are there no sections of Calculus III at a time when I can take them, not only at DVC but also at Contra Costa Community College, Solano college, and Napa College. Are there any others I can try?   And I'm tired of people that use its when they mean it's, if you want to say it is use IT'S DAMNIT!!! The same goes with your, and you're. And what's with Yellow Cabs anyways, so what if it's yellow, doesn't have to be in the damn name does it!         "
"       I just read  this  and found it pretty sad. This kid wants to go kill Muslims. That's it, kill Muslims. God I hope they don't let him into any branch of the armed forces, just what we need, some kid with his own Muslim killing agenda. This is sad on so many levels it's not even funny.   Normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it. Normally fear that these people aren't actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can. How many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems...not alot, because they know they are secure in their job and aren't afraid that someone that isn't acclimated to the culture and can't speak the language well is going to come and take their job away. As far as I'm concerned if you can be replaced by someone that can't speak English and only just got here then you probably didn't deserve your job in the first place.   I also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals. I'm sorry but you can't go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next. Illegals work harder for less money than most of this country, they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place. They embody free market capitalism, they risk everything for a shot at a better life, and they are willing to work hard for it. And because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables. I don't hear anyone complaining about that, you never hear anyone say 'Damn those illegals, these oranges should cost 10 times this much!!!'.   The funny part of it is that we, as a country, support the illegals every day. If you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it. Do you shop at Walmart? Guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals.   Just like my answer to anything you don't like in our society, if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott. If you don't like illegals then don't buy anything they pick, shop anywhere they clean, or pay them for anything. Personally I don't care about illegals, like I said, I know they aren't taking my job. And I'm pretty secure in knowing that most Americans are too lazy, stupid, and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal 'problem' so all they will keep doing is talking shit.   Another thing I love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on Earth just because they are born here. I'm sorry, but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they don't deserve to live here. I've got news for you kid, no one born deserves to live here, some of us are just lucky. And before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party I have to ask you, what have you done to make this country great? People go on and on about how great this country is, and I don't disagree, this is a great country, but it's not through their actions that it's great. It's thanks to people like Thomas Edison, The Wright brothers, and, thought I REALLY hate to say it Henry Ford that this country is great. It has nothing to do with John Q. Asshole that does alot of talking but doesn't do shit worth talking about, every country has those. Until you do something worth talking about I don't really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldn't because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the U.S. to maintain it's dominance in the world. It always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them.         "
"       As the title suggests I had a great weekend, I'm just sorry that it had to end. I wont go into all the specifics but I hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw La Plebe play at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of Oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, Charlotte, is starting to like me but Maggie still seems pretty wary of me.   I got to see two parades this year, Vallejo and Benicia's. I think I can say without too much hometown bias that Vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that Benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in Vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat Vallejo's handsdown though. In Vallejo the Vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In Benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that Benicia is missing and that is a Ducky Durby. I know I bought a duck from a person in Vallejo's parade, thought I didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, I don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address.   Well, this was a great weekend and I'm glad that I got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because I would know that I had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to.

"       I know no one care about this, but I will post about it anyways.  I have been working on my game and it's going somewhat well. Since I posted that screenshot I have added such wonderfull and awe inspireing things as bullets, and one enemy that doesn't have the ability to fire at you yet, which is okay because it's mostly just a flying bomb itself, it has been named a spin-drone. Mostly because it's a drone, and it spins, or it should. Right now it just looks like a tweeker robot thing that is makeing strange movements that don't really resemble spinning at all.   I am such a bad pixel artist it isn't even funny. Well, for other people it's funny, and I guess I do laugh sometimes at my own crappy art, so I guess I should say that i'm such a bad pixel artist that it's only occasionally funny, and most time the horrors oof my art are beyond humor. Maybe I'm going over the top a little, but I don't think so.   I'd post another screenshot but I'm lazy and no one would care so why bother. Plus the game isn't that visually different yet. I need to work on the HUD a little more and take all the debugging text of the screen, and add another enemy or two, then I'll post another screenie for you all to ignore.  BTW if anyone that may be reading this is a pixel artist and wants to have their name in the credits of this game post your e-mail addy and I'll get back to you.   A large chunk of the coding for this game is done, everything I have do has been done with the idea of code re-use in mind. All I have to do is add support for a few things and the buld of the game will be finished, so if an artist were to join up now if would be quick easy game credits to show their art in action. So, after all I'm really the one helping you out, not the other way around.         "
"            So this week I took a break from doing absolutely nothing with my life to go to Linuxworld and try to waste my time getting cheap Linux related junk that will collect dust in my house. It was a great success. On Tuesday LoveLostLibra came with my and we made the rounds hitting up every booth we could, gaining information and looking for cheap crap like it were the holy grail. Some products I had a real interest in, Blackduck had a pretty cool app for programming teams, and others that I couldn't care less about, ahem...veritas..., but only talked to to get the cheap crap.   LLL and I had a pretty good time, I think (maybe he's really plotting to get back at me for boring him to tears for bringing to a Linux trade show, who knows), Intel threw a pretty nice after-party that had some great food and a pretty cool 80's cover band. They also had a bunch of free-to-play pool tables. We all had great fun and ate and drank and were merry and stuff. Then we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit, it's a train) back to where I parked earlier. Let me tell you that was the longest BART ride I ever had. I had to pee so bad my teeth were swimming in it. I ended up having to go in the women's restroom because there was someone in the men's room and there was no time for politeness for formality. If the women's had been locked I would have been peeing into a trashcan or something.   Thursday I went back to Linux world on a solo mission of justice. I had been cheated of a great bounty of cheap shit the previous trip and I was coming back to clean house, and clean house I did. Four T-shirts, a bank, a mini-USB hub, enough mints and pens to make Mr. T cry. I especially liked the end of the conference on this, the last, day. The roles were reversed, vendors were practically begging people to take their stuff so they wouldn't have any left over. I can't think of one piece of swag that I missed.  There was no after party however, ohh well. Can't win em all ehh? For lunch I ate at a 'Mexican' restaurant in the Metreon. I had a chicken quesadilla and a Sobe, it came to just over $9.00. While eating I was forced to think about the Mexican place I recently ate at in the Mission. This food was bland and almost tasteless, and very expensive, while the food server just a couple miles away was authentic, real, and not very expensive at all. It made me sad to think that things would be so watered down for the people ate at this place. What mostly made me sad was how much I paid for this crappy food. How lame...            "
"       I was telling Miss Macy about my idea that the Smurfs were communist propaganda and she told me to write it in my blog, so here it goes...  First off you have Papa smurf. He takes care of all the smurfs and coordinates the resources of the entire village. He also wears a RED hat, what a fucking commie. All of the smurfs have names that denote what they do in the village. Handy smurf, Heafty, Brainy (?), ect. They all do something, even if it's only just stand there and look good and no matter what they do they all get the same reward for their work. They all have the same house, the same food, and they all want to get some from smurfette but she aint givin' up to any of them. I don't know what that has to do with communism, but it still sucks all the same.  Now this brings us to Gargamel. This is where it gets deep. Gargamel is a capitalist that is always trying to make some cash by turning the smurfs into gold. Or to put it more simply, he wants to make money off of the hard working smurfs. If that doesn't scream bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat I don't know what does.   I don't know what the hell those two prince kids represented, but I'm sure it's something communist.          "

"           This blogging is a new thing for me, although writing is not.  I am blogging out of a need to expel my creativity from myself and share it with others, and my horoscope told me to 'Take a chance at creating something in an old or new medium,' so here I am, creating something in a new medium.  I like to be able to say what I want to, about things that I don't like, things that I like, and to be able to share thoughts, ideas,my life and opinions with others, and these days blogging seems to be the way to do that.    So, here I am, trying my hand at sharing everything I can think of with everyone that is interested, read on and enjoy, or not! I really just want to write, write, write, and hope to do at least some every day.   Catcha later! Critter Keeper          "
"           Have you ever noticed how many people use terms of endearment, just out of habit?  Personally, I don't use any terms of endearment, even with my own family.  I don't call my husband 'dear' or 'honey', and I don't call my children 'sweetheart' or 'sugar' or anything else that comes to mind.    I work at a long term care facility, and everyone I work with has their own special names that they call the folks they work with, residents and staff alike.  I have found during my long stay at the facility where I work that the residents don't always like to be called 'hon' or 'sweetie' or even 'dear'. But, people continue to call them just that. There are a lot of pet names out there, and frankly I think that it really makes people uncomfortable when others don't call them what they like to be called.  And it makes people uncomfortable when others assume that they should accept it when they use terms of endearment.   I do know that it makes me uncomfortable when I go to Church and instead of addressing me as my own real name, people call me 'honey' and 'dear' and 'sugar' and 'sweetheart', when I feel that these people don't know me well enough to assume that those names are what I want to be called.    So then, the big question would be, why does it make me uncomfortable? and maybe I should be asking why don't I use terms of endearment myself??  The answer to that would be: I really don't know. I just know that I don't assign names to anyone, and it makes me uncomfortable when people assign names other than my own to me. Perhaps someone out there might know what could be the reasons.           "
"           So here I am, listening to my neighbor's son's band, jamming in their garage, and watching Monsters,Inc., and blogging right along.  And the question of this day is....... Catnip? Is it the drug of choice for your cats, or do you, like a few others think that we shouldn't be drugging our kitties??  I give my cat(the monster Worf) catnip so he will stay quiet and not bother my other cat (Abby), and so that the house can rest from his antics. Abby on the other hand does not get catnip because she goes in heat which really bothers the little man cat Worf.  He then chases noisy Abby around and makes a lot of noise himself.  They both like to roll in it when I rub it on toys and on the carpet.  And Worf tends to slobber a lot when he eats the fresh catnip. I consider it a drug, and it is an herb, like marijuana, but I don't think the local law enforcement would approve of me growing the latter herb in my yard.( I will admit that I like the smell of marijuana, and it would make a wonderful incense.)But alas, it is still an illegal herb, and I really don't need the trouble that would go along with growing it, and using it.  Meanwhile, and back to the catnip, I can grow that legally, even though it is a drug for my cats, and I myself have been known to eat a leaf to relieve the occasional stomach ache (and it does the trick for me) with the added side effect of causing me a bit of drowsiness, so if I really needed it I suppose I could use it to help me to sleep at night, which is an ongoing problem (not sleeping). I think this year, besides drying it for the kitties, I will be drying some for tea, to relieve my stomach when it is being unruly.  And another question...Since marijuana is a drug, is catnip a drug too??          "

"           some things that people do that really peeve me:  Tell me something that they think I should know, but I don't, and act like I am the idiot because I didn't know it Tell me something that I do know that doesn't bear repeating Tell me something that I don't know, but don't want to know Tell me something that they know that is none of my business Think that they are God's Gift to Mankind Act like they think they are GGtoM Think that I give a rat's patootie about their financial problems, when I have more than my share of my own Tell people that they shouldn't be telling personal problems that 1st person couldn't do a thing about Subject me or others to their own preferences, without maybe taking a moment to consult for an opinion 35-40 year old women who sit at work and act like 13 year old boys, making obsene noises and laughing about it (immature to the max) People that don't do their work, slough it off on others then can't understand why people don't like them, and can't understand why they never accomplish anything worth while People that dress inappropriately for their work, or for the places they go Inappropriate displays of affection in public (remember there are children out there and we wouldn't want our own children seeing other people doing those things) People that don't teach their children values, hobbies and how to respect other people and their property People that think it is cute to teach their children to cuss (we're really teaching them to use their english properly) Asking the elderly for financial help, when most of the elderly have enough of their own financial problems Mistreating other people, and animals People that live where it is cold, by choice and constantly whine and complain about the cold People that jump to conclusions People that interrupt conversations just to hear themselves People that think they have to compete with everyone for the most friends, you know, he who has the most friends wins People that think the whole day at work is just a competition People that think they have to control all situations People that can't work together as a team, by puttins aside problems People that bring home to work, and the attitudes they get from things that happen at home People with a bad attitude People that never smile and finally People that whine about anything and everything  Well, I gotta go!  Well then, that was a list worth writing, at least to me!         "
"           so,what do I think about...... about food, and why I eat or don't eat what   I can eat pork liver, but not beef liver because it smells pissy to my. I realize that liver can't be the best anyhow because it is the body's filter, and organ meat isn't good for your heart.  I don't like the smell of eggs and ketchup together. My husband likes to eat scrambled eggs with ketchup on them, yucky!  I can eat ketchup, but it is not my favorite thing.  Peanut butter and bologna sandwiches just don't taste right, and peanut butter and dill pickles aren't too great either.  I love to eat bread with peanut butter along with a bowl of chili, and I do know some other people who like the same.  Things with a lot of vinegar give me heartburn  Miracle whip is not mayonnaise.  Really rich and sweet stuff turns my stomach, I think it is in fact the richness of it and not the sweetness.  I know someone that won't eat anything that doesn't 'look good', I eat most things, looking good or not, and I never refuse free food.  I also know someone that won't eat mushrooms because they grow in manure, if she only knew how many things are grown in manure, she would probably starve to death. I believe she drinks, and most things with alcohol are the result of yeast eating the sugars, the alcohol is like the yeast's excrement, a by product of the yeast (little living creatures) after it has digested the sugars, it's waste, so to speak.  Personally I am game to try anything, once. If I don't like it, then I may not eat it again.  I did try head cheese, and didn't like it, something about the texture, I gave it to my cat and he didn't like it either. Later in life I worked in a deli, and used to slice head cheese, did you know that because of the rubbery texture it actually squeals on the slicer. And it smells bad.  I had a customer how she wanted the head cheese sliced, once upon a time, she said about an inch thick, so I had to ask her how she could eat it, she said she liked it with lots of salt.    And I don't eat salt on much of anything, because I feel that you can't taste what you are eating if you use salt.    Eggs are great with a soft yolk, a little bit of 'snot', (unofficially still clear albumen), along side toast (almost burnt) with butter and a lot of crispy bacon.  I do think that anything, if prepared right is good, and I will eat anything that is tasty. I really prefer things that aren't sweet, I like meats, vegetables, breads, cereals, anything to drink, chocolate, and fruits.  so what do you like??? input would be appreciated.............

"             Yesterday while shooping for my husband, i am usually very nice and polite and try to use as much German as possible. But I always don't have the write words or i just don't know the language that well to come up with a solution to my conversation. Anyway I went to this store here called,'Budnikowsky'. It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time,even on Mondays, I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier, she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag, meaning Hello back. My total was 1,98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1,98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her. Like she was telling me you stupid idiot dont you understand and if you dont you dont belong in my line. Well of course after that gester and after dealing with my sick daughter all day shopping i had all I could take of the day and promptly recieved my change and replied to her, 'You know yo can eat shit!!'. From the look on her face i can tell she understood everything i said even in english. After that i felt great for the rest of the day. I find if you are nice to these workers they run all over you until you are nasty like them back and then they are your best friend.  Viki C.          "

"   although i will probably denounce everything written here within a few days - will see how the immovable posting sits there on my screen and betrays me - i think i'll be posting here frequently. what is beautiful about drafts is that they are never finished, always boiling just below the skin, but never your skin. never you. i love going through old drafts. most remain as drafts, and are always there to give you a fresh point of departure. there's a certain amount of power in that, at least for a profession such as this, where powerlessness is nearly all of the time and contemplation the only respite.  you see the thing is is that i stole my roommate maya aravind's chair while she's away for the week, so i have an excuse to be typing here as much as possible. the arm rests are a perfect height. plain pine, but they curve inward slightly. with my elbows propped upon them, my fingers meet about an inch below the chin, and to do any contemplating i really have to hunch. rodin's statue is precise because with the chin rested firmly at the end of a hunch, on some knuckles, one's thoughts sink right down into the mouth.   at Nussbaum & Wu this afternoon, Broadway and 113, i saw a hungry baby offered a french fry by his mother from off of the father’s plate.  instead of letting the baby bite off the piece of fry slipped into her mouth, the mother pulls it back at the last second.  the baby gets only the oily and salty taste from off the air-cooled fry.  like any creature of common sense, the child extends her hand toward the father’s plate, beyond the mother entirely, toward that universally tantalizing taste.  broadway and 113 is as good a place as any in New York to watch, for brief moments and in teased out performances, beautiful women. in any other city the pace of life would slow us all to a parade lingering too long on the eye. this is uncomfortable for the voyeur at any other pace.  the voyeur would begin to isolate the intricate flaws of the women walking by. i suppose an argument can be made that a voyeur perceives slower in other cities, and that the speed of the women walking is relative to his skill for ignoring the obvious and celebrating the ideal. i suppose an argument could be made that New York has the most beautiful women and the best admirers of them. i would personally find it a difficult point to argue. if anything, they certainly walk faster here than anywhere else women have some place to go. where exactly they're going, i have no idea. it ain't toward me.

"   i seem to have signed up for a blog. my intention was to post a comment after seeing my name used in some kind of article on a blog entitled http://dontyouhatepants.blogspot.com.. i know now it was written by an old friend named nicholas 'zach morris' mcdowell, but at first glance (from a link on the schroek blog) i thought i was being fooled by some kind of cookie-manipulating, sarcasm-generating cyborg joke site. i seem to have been half right. anyway, i might as well tell you about my week and mention that if you visit the 'hate pants' site you'll see i made some comment about cowing out. cowing out? i've never known a soul who would  store such a phrase in their vocabulary. i felt i needed to respond and now i've got a fucking blog. i do however use the word 'anywho.'  my week.  anywho last saturday was a trip to one of the half dozen fabulous cinemas on houston st, the sunshine, for a first-time viewing of the princess bride. i went with max oglesbee, his sister phoebe (13 yo), and her friend abby. they were practically hyperventilating at the midnight showing of one of their favorite movies, and it was as fun to watch them as it was to watch the movie itself. we met tara lorenzen for a brief minute before the movie. she was at the sidewalk cafe on avenue a (gorgeous phrase right?) and carried her beer out with her in her purse. tara and i went into the ace bar on 5th street, watched pat moynihan botch a game of pool, introduced tara to rob, then walked her to the train and went to see the movie. highlight of the evening was the after-film piss with max, where my comment on mark knopfler's soundtrack got a surprising chuckle out of the urinal between us, a man who later commented that the rainbow colored rainboots we used to sneak beer into the movie theatre were 'the kind of shit i'm talking about!' whatever-in-the-living fuck that meant. seriously, that hombre was 'cowed out.'  sunday i worked at my part-time 2-day a week for a free membership job at the 92nd street Y. its a cultural center more than a gym, and you can learn more about it at http://www.92ndsty.org.   monday i was invited by a dear friend mr. josh peskowitz to a fader magazine/cornerstone party at a gallery space on 18th street betwixt 9th and 10th. free beers provided by red stripe and harp, a free show of ted leo/the pharmacists and the libertines. the libertines were great looking, and ted leo was great sounding. at least to me. i'm not sure if max o. and jersey walz, my friends in attendance, enjoyed, but i certainly did. a vague head-nod and hello to a mr. james iha, in attendance; who ten years ago would have made me crawl across the floor to gush unscripted professions of adoration. nice to see he's still... turning japanese. i really think so. the after party at the maritime hotel was more of a before party. max and i left before it seemed to really get off the ground.  tuesday i was at the gym again and at the evening took a phone call from danielle florio to hear about the last phish show. despite not being a fan, i was enthralled at the experiences she encountered and couldn't help the mild pangs of jealousy i felt at missing what seemed a pretty historic event. slept well for the first time in all of august i think, drifting to sleep with images of vermont dancing vicariously through my head.  wednesday at the libraries all day, researching and editing an old piece of nonfiction. et ceteras...  thursday i had lunch with jersey walz, a brief stop at her father's lawyer's apartment on 72nd and central park west. had her homemade granola for the first time since the day she left for italy last summer. with rice milk. i gave her 12 blues songs on a cd-r, and she gave me a bag of granola to go. saw her new portrait camera ( a knockout ), some of her mother's antartica photos, and then hailed her a cab outside the building on the way to port authority. workers were tearing up the sidewalk out in front of the dakota, where 24 years ago john lennon was shot. i'm sure its been replaced several times since, but i had to wonder. rode with her bags and waited with her till she got on her bus to boston. she's staying at kurt vonnegut's house in barnstable mass this week, and will probably have some extraordinary photographs of the author and the ocean when she returns. you'd think in such a situation a man who pretends to be mildly intellectual could've figured out a way to get hisself invited along, but i was too stunned to even think of it.   and then afterwards i went to r.a.w. cuts barber shop next door to my building for a haircut. only white face in the premises. normally i can get by in these kinds of situations; talk hip-hop, talk jazz, talk r&b, talk movies. these particular guys just weren't havin' it. listened to my barber anthony tell me about the finer points of black pussy, asian women, and the barbershop basketball league. my big white irish face reflected off two mirrors, and a deep sadness that i could not, after all, 'hang.' but after the cut (45 minute cut for $12 bones, unbelievable), they invited me back to chill out front and have some beers. anthony's brother stanley told one of the best stories i've ever heard. one of those classics where nothing really happens, and its all in the telling (and unlike this one you're reading), but damn!  friday was a gem. worked the Y in the morning, tutored a 4th grader in math in the bronx after lunch, a college student in queens (requiring a 1.75 hour train ride through brooklyn to richmond hill), and then back to another student's on the lower east side. in all, four boroughs before dinner. danielle florio took the train in from westchester and met me on 125th street. i showed her my new harlem apartment, which she loved more than i ever will. we had a beer in the living room and then dined at the quintessential soul food restaurant, charles' southern fried chicken on 152nd and 8th avenue. the world's best fried chicken, in case you were wondering. the ribs, collards, sweet potatoes, and pulled pork are also in the world's top ten. took a stroll through one of my favorite neighborhoods in all of new york, the well-preserved and oft-overlooked hamilton heights. i love taking people over there and talking my usual over-factual conversation through these near-silent, immaculate streets. its about convent avenue from 145th to 135th, with a stroll down hamilton terrace at 143rd to see the house used by wes anderson in the royal tenenbaums. at 141st the preserved former house of alexander hamilton, where he lived from 1802-04, when he was killed in a duel in... of all places...hoboken.... saw a sign across from hamilton's crib stating 'apartments $1000-1600,' prompting me to speculate ways to get out of my lease.  and so we're only at 10pm on friday. waited at the D train stop on 125th, at a popeyes, for danielle's new boyfriend peter atlas. a very sweet and overwhelmingly laid back cat from middletown ny, who accompanied us back to my place while i took a shower. while i was in the shower, six gunshots rang out from a guy going by on a motorcycle. i didn't hear it at all, but the hip couple in my living room swore it was true. lenox ave was shut down right outside my window, and our ride to the evening's party was mildly rerouted.  the evening's party was at the yankee ferry, a boat parked on pier 23 in tribeca, at the end of north moore st. to be brief, which i haven't been, its a boat owned by a friend of a friend. a 1909 former staten island ferry, its the only boat in manhattan you can live on, and since the owners were gone for the weekend, max o. was in charge. which meant a very rare opportunity for a small gathering on the upper deck, surrounded by the financial district, the holland tunnel ventilation towers, abandoned piers, and the warehouses of tribeca. out in the hudson, a gorgeous, humid evening, with a collective of great folks celebrating morgan whirledge's 21st birthday. a well-timed joint created a blur of wildly nonsensical topics of conversation, one of them being the heaven better than the heaven from stairway to heaven. I know you're thinking 'stairway to better heaven,' but actually we preferred to call it 'stairway to uber-heaven.' max described this particular heaven in these quotes below, which i scrawled on an atm receipt in my pocket and deciphered this morning.  'stairway to uber-heaven, the eiffel 94 supersonic master plan! the relative major of the tonic brigade! did i say tunnel bridge? you can't have a tunnel that's a bridge, that's impossible.'  after this, we calmed down slightly, and max told morgan and i another one of the best stories i've ever heard: the entire history of the yankee ferry. it included trips through both world wars, decades-long tours as a staten and block island ferry, and its last ten years as a historical landmark and a controversial eyesore in the new york harbor. a completely fascinating story, including how the boat got its water, electricity, and its docking privileges. it wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it wasn't in constant threat of sinking or being removed from the pier by the ny/nj port authority.   on the pier at around three (vagueness starting to settle in), we took off from the boat and ran through the sand of the beach volleyball courts on the adjoining pier. soft sand between the toes is a luxury rarely known by the city resident, while the drunk city resident ponders the beauty of lying down in it and never getting up again.  and so that brings me to tonight. just returned from a relaxing evening spent at a party in the building on the fourth floor. played three vicious games of spades at the card table in the kitchen, where despite a rusty start, finished the last two games with my teammate julio in the victory collumn. the last game went to a third tie-breaker, all bets wagered, a crowd of onlookers and four spades left in my hand for the final rounds. won the last two hands for a meager ten points victory. risked it all and came out huge. could have spent the evening hitting on the pretty peruvian girl celia who came into my apartment hours before looking for one of my roommates, and instead i played cards with a harlem local, a brooklyn native, and a spaniard. and a white boy from upstate new york who has a lot more game with a stack of cards then with the ladies.   so that's my week. i wanted to post it and then maybe someday i can come back to it and seen what i did mid-august of 2004. i'm not much into the blogging thing. the reason the post is so long is because well, i can see this being the one and only post of this site. i've had better weeks and plan to have better ones still, but its nice every once in a while to capture this shit and have it the way it was when i remembered it freshly, and not out of some haze of a few years on. who knows. hope you enjoyed.

"   It's a well-established personal rule that I only inhabit dance clubs if (a) I get in free. (b) I get to stand and drink beer in a VIP area and (c) there's a kick-ass DJ.  In other words, I don't club-hop often.  But last night I had a connection to a hot show at the Avalon in Hollywood, where the rapidly-developing-a-cult-following  urlLink D.J. Wolfie  was spinning.  But the highlight of the evening was  urlLink The Mutaytor , a percussion-stunt-dance ensemble that puts on a high-energy performance art-techno show.  Think Blue Man Group meets Cirque du Soleil.  Anyway, they have a bunch of shows coming up on the West Coast and I highly recommend them if you're in the area.   The Wolfie/Mutaytor bill sold out the 1,200-capacity Avalon, and 300 people were turned away.  So if you didn't have a VIP pass, it was a typical stand-all-night-in-line Hollywood evening.  I felt a little special...;) Oh, and I met one the girls from Survivor, but I've never seen Survivor so the brush with celebrity was completely lost on me until my date told me it was the girl from Survivor.  Whew.   "
"   so this man who writes this blog thinks american soldiers are heroes?  when they come home in a box and their mommies and daddies cry and and they have a big funeral their president doesn't attend?    i won't be throwing out that image of paul johnson.  the severed head will burn in my head as a symbol of the consequences of wanton murder and thievery, as it should for every american.  i came to the united states in 1998, to study religious studies on full scholarship at ucla.  i spoke not a word of english, and the americans looked down at me like i was their pet dog, running for a stupid stick in the park.  if you don't understand what song the stupid girl on american idol sings, they hate you.    after 9/11 i was persecuted for the color of my skin.  they didn't like brown folks.  i was held by homeland security when my phone records were traced to iraq.  they did full body cavity search.  and you americans think pain is rinsing your mouth too long with the listerine.    you heard it right.  i was born in iraq.  my parents still live there.  they'd love to join in this blog, but they've never used a computer.  i only lived in iraq until i was nine.  then i went to live with an uncle in england.  one brother came with me, two other brothers stayed in iraq.  they were killed by u.s. troops in this past year's fighting.  but i had not spoken to either of them in 17 years so it wasn't a crushing thing.  i did not stay in bed for 6 months and cry like a little baby and make people feel sorry for me like americans do when someone dies.  i only tracked my parents again in 1999.  i talk to them about monthly.  my father owned a store before the occupation.  now he has nothing.    was that so bad, blaine?  you were so afraid of a few empty threats...like americans who hide in their basements when they here the 2000 bug will destroy them.  i knew you would soil yourself at the mere thought of iraqi redemption.  but i am benevolent, not the opposite.  i live in los angeles and i lead a simple life, selling computer hardware. if blaine allows, and you all want, i will tell more.

"   So I got an e-mail regarding my first  urlLink post.   And I must admit, I was quite disturbed.  I never though this blogging thing would make my palms sweat and conjure thoughts of calling my parents to outline my funeral wishes ('H' by Tool during interment, for the record.)    I know, I know.  I'm anonymous.  There's nothing to be afraid of. Unless he secretly works for blogspot.     This goofball did, however, ask to write a guest blog.    Now, this proposal wedged me betweeen my desire to be heard and my desire to ignore frightening people who 'hope (I) lock up tight and get police protection, cuz (he) knows (I'm) in the L.A. area and (he) will find (me) if (he) has to knock on 5 million doors.'  Not a comfortable place.  But I gave in to the warm-and-fuzzies that accompanied the first time I saw 'guest blog' and 'Blaine's' in the same sentence.   I want this to be an open forum for the excahange of ideas, even if the first return salvo is some wacko fantasizing about all the ways he'd like to 'skin (me) while I sleep, then toss (my) bones in with (his) morning broth'.  Faris ('not like the lazy infidel bueller' he stresses) will make his Blaine's Hospitable Habitat debut some time in the next day or two.    I apologize in advance.  I encourage you all to ramp up the discourse here so that Blaine's may be home to less malevolent voices in the future.     "

"   Get ready for a week of Paul Johnson still shots, superimposed by waving-in-slow-motion video of Old Glory. On some stations, they'll probably play God Bless America or The Star-Spangled Banner for effect.  In Dub-Ya's home state, they might play 'Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American).'  A vaporous war has a new object of affection.  The masses will now be told to rally behind the headless body of Paul Johnson, images of which were downloaded today across corporate America like Paris Hilton tape stills.    I won't go the way of the heartless Reagan bashers and decry Paul Johnson's life's work.  I have too much respect for a human being and his grieving family.  But he worked for Lockheed-Martin, a central cog in the military-industrial complex that spurred America's push into Iraq, which spurred today's events.   Decide for yourself whether Paul Johnson was an American hero.  Don't let the faux-grievous news anchors make your mind up for you.  But before you choose to place this man on a pedestal and shake your fist toward the Middle East in his name, ask yourself:  was Ken Ballard a hero?  Bumrok Lee?  Todd Bolding?  Cody Calavan?  Bradli Coleman?  Daniel Eggers?  Aaron Elandt?  Benjamin Gonzalez?  Joseph Jeffries?  Markus Johnson?  Robert Mogensen?  Dominique Nicolas?  Charles Odums II?  Brian Ouellette?  Robert Scheetz Jr?  Dustin Sides?  Michael Wiesemann?  Nicholaus Zimmer?  Rafael Reynosa?  If you don't recognize any of these names, check out the June 6, 2004 obituaries in the  Los Angeles Times .  I'll tell you two things up front:  none of these men were older than 28.  And none of these men earned serving their country what Paul Johnson collected working for Lockheed-Martin.     I'm still waiting for their pictures on CNN, with nice digitally-rendered yellow ribbons tied around them. "
"   So I socialized today.&nbsp; And yesterday.&nbsp; I got a couple e-mails inviting me to interesting little grad student and young professional things—a foreign film screening and a networking event—so I got in my car and I drove there, like millions of people in L.A. do when a friend calls and tells them, hey, dude there’s a neat screening of this really twisted Russian film, or hey, co-worker I have an occasional beer with after work, guess what, I heard about this get-together among people who work their ass off 40-50 hours a week at the same type of job we have and let’s go commiserate and talk about how much we hate our bosses and the petulance of the well-to-do American executive and hey, we might even make a good friend.&nbsp; Imagine that. &nbsp;A good friend.&nbsp; A new friend.  &nbsp;  I get to the foreign film screening and no one is in the theater.&nbsp; Great, I think.&nbsp; Drove up here for nothing.&nbsp; Wasted all this gas.&nbsp; So glad I decided to socialize.&nbsp; Then I walk outside and see the grad students, playing a sun-splashed game of croquet on the University quad.&nbsp; They’re all tan and sweaty and red-faced on this dry-hot day, because dry-hot is the only way they can get hot and sweaty playing croquet.&nbsp; They’re also chasing each other around, playing flirtatious games with the croquet mallot.&nbsp; My good friend in the Dodger hat slides the nub in the performance artist girl’s butt-cleavage.&nbsp; Hysterical laughter ensues, and the faces get redder and everyone’s having a great time and let’s reach in the big red cooler and get another beer and isn’t it gosh-darn lovely to be 25 and still have care-free summers?&nbsp; And who the hell is this guy in the chinos and discount Kohl’s dress shirt?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Dude, aren’t you hot?” offers my Dodger fan friend, barely recognizable, having grown a pillowy tuft of hair since I last saw him three months ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I grin sheepishly, nodding at the crooked wickets.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Looks like something you do in the summer.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nobody gets my ironic attempt at humor.&nbsp; Yeah, dipshit, they all think, it does look like something you do in the summer.&nbsp; That’s why we’re doing it.&nbsp; Go back to your cubicle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The foreign film is indulgent, like the moderator said it would be, and afterward everyone pairs off into the summer romances that have blossomed, and everyone asks me when I’m graduating.&nbsp; Like they can’t wait to get rid of me.&nbsp; Like they never had me.&nbsp; But then, how could they have ever had me?&nbsp; I sit behind a desk all day.&nbsp; I was lucky to make it to this screening on time at 7 p.m.&nbsp; They run in the park and wallow in the shade of California green tall spiky trees and feed each other grapes and wine and Miller Lite.&nbsp; They enjoy life.&nbsp; And I can’t be their friends.&nbsp; Not unless they’ll carry a Blackberry around and check it regularly for the latest off-color e-mail forward, anyway.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I socialized and had a crappy time and felt like a dad showing up early to pick his 13-year-old son from a testosterone-drenched sleep-over, one with Playboys and Ultimate Fighting and Hustlers and Bench Press Contests and Barely Legals. I was a stuffed-shirt spoiler.&nbsp; Maybe I needed to hang out with my element: work-a-holic twenty-somethings.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So the next evening I get in my good-times-mobile and head north again.&nbsp; I feel like a mouse in a maze trying to park in the cramped little beach town, but I finally slide into a curbside without red markings.&nbsp; On the way to the meeting place, I break a twenty at a dive bar and pound a Red Stripe, at once an attempt to avoid awkwardness in a group pay-for-the-check situation and an attempt to get a little buzz going before meeting a bunch of strangers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But from the moment I shake Heidi’s hand, I know letting beer slip through my lips was akin to chugging a 40-ouncer before a basketball game.&nbsp; Networking is an endurance event, a discipline worth mastering.&nbsp; Drinking will throw you from your game.&nbsp; Heidi would know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “I’ve been networking and networking and networking,” Heidi says.&nbsp; “You have to do it so hard-core.&nbsp; And here in L.A? &nbsp;Please.&nbsp; It’s all about who you know.&nbsp; It’s never merit.&nbsp; And believe me, I have merit.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Berkeley grad.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Held a mid-management slot in San Francisco.&nbsp; And these people are trying to look at me for entry-level work?&nbsp; Are they kidding me?”  &nbsp;  Nobody else is any different, except a lovely undersized couple from a head-hunting firm literally trying to sell me.&nbsp; Everyone gripes about their current job and about how their tenacious networking has yet to pay off.&nbsp; My networking has yet to advance beyond hooking my DSL line up to the hub, so I guess I’m in trouble.&nbsp; I wanted to have a few laughs, pick up some job leads, maybe, find a way out of my current hell-in-a-cubicle.&nbsp; All I got was a sales pitch and a twenty-minute sermon on forging connections and collecting as many business cards as you can from a girl who apparently didn’t deem me worthy, because she left without requesting a business card.&nbsp; And then there was the girl I remembered from the last networking event I went to a year ago, who didn’t remember me and seemed freaked out when I greeted her by name.&nbsp; Then she politely told me to take a hike, “Go talk to Larry and Davida….they can help you find a better job.”&nbsp; In other words, go walk into a sales pitch.&nbsp; You’re scaring me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So after two days of flaunting my formidable social graces, it’s time for a consolation prize: a 40 of Mickey’s.&nbsp; I pull into the Liquor store near home.&nbsp; It’s an easy summer night and the tall, lean Armenian attendant I know too well stands outside.&nbsp; Must be slow in there.&nbsp; I feel a little uneasy walking past him, making him go back to work, becoming the only man in an empty temple of booze.&nbsp; But soon I have company.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Hey-ah, Dood, whasssup?”  &nbsp;  It’s a stumbling drunk in a blue hockey jersey.&nbsp; He’s heading for the same cooler I am.&nbsp; I grab my Mickey’s, expecting to hear a “Good call, dude,” but instead:  &nbsp;  “Ah, it’s Sarmuch, boy.&nbsp; Sarmush, how ya doin’?&nbsp; Back here now, huh?”  &nbsp;  Sarmuch the Armenian attendant nods politely, then walks towards the register to check me out.  &nbsp;  “They usually got you over on 4th and Ximeno now, huh?” hockey guy bellows, loud enough to crack a mini-bottle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don’t care how Sarmuch responds.&nbsp; I am in the liquor store, joining a man, who so frequents the local liquor stores he notices when folks shift from site to site, in buying a 40-ouncer.&nbsp; Maybe  he’s  my kind of guy.&nbsp;   "
"   Like Joe Pesci mulling over his mom’s Red Riding Hood painting, I’m taking a long look like at the world and putting my own spin on things. &nbsp;Is this an original thing to do?&nbsp; Hardly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But I can’t help but look around.&nbsp; Granted, my view is considerably impeded by my cubicle.&nbsp; So I’m really doing a lot of introspection.&nbsp; Which is what I believe what Pesci was doing in that very underrated scene. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why am I such a hard guy to get along with?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why does my roommate and best friend piss me off when he leaves cans and dirty plates out, when my room looks like a landfill the week after Christmas?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why have I only cared about five women in the last four years?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why have I met all of them on the Internet?  &nbsp;  Why have none of the five women I’ve slept with in the last four years been any of the ones I’ve cared about?  &nbsp;  Why did I meet all of them on the Internet?  &nbsp;  Am I losing touch with reality?  &nbsp;  Do I care about my job too much?  &nbsp;  Then why do I feel like showering every evening when I cease my soulless desk-jockeying?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Do I care about writing too much?  &nbsp;  Then why haven’t I ever spent an entire eight hour day working on a piece?  &nbsp;  Ever!  &nbsp;  And I’m borderline professional, people!&nbsp; Been published in newspapers and magazines and shit!  &nbsp;  Whatever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I’m done.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Faris still wants to say something, but I gotta get a few posts up first.&nbsp; Hey, it’s my goddamn blog.&nbsp;   "

"       Listening to:  Stevie  by Yesterdays New Quintet  I had a dream about Mama the other night.  She was bedridden; her body wasnt whole.  She was sickly looking, wasting away, her head covered with peach fuzz that couldnt grow back any thicker.  She looked very much the way she did in the last few weeks she was still alive, but in my dream she was just a torso and head, no arms or legs.  In my dream she said to me, Kiss  ko ,  anak ko  (Kiss me, my child).    Before Mama went unconscious [her body took weeks to shut down, little by little], she said to me, Kiss  ko , baby  ko  whenever she was aware that I was by her side.  Whenever I sat by her, she told me she loved me and I told her I loved herI never left her without saying it because I was always afraid it would be the last time for me to say it to her or to hear it from her.  The day after Mama went into her coma, Daddy called me, crying, telling me to go to Bakersfield.  He said the night before Mama's condition got even worse (to the point where she was just barely holding on), he and my Auntie Thelma were praying with her and she said something, but he couldn't make it out.  He said after she repeated it a couple of times, he realized she was calling for me.  I drove for four hours to be by Mama's side, early the next morning; the second I walked through the door and went to her, she focused her eyes on me for a bit.  Then they rolled back into her head; I slept on the floor next to her that night.  The following evening she passed away.   Sigh.   A couple days ago I also dreamed about my boss.  Her father passed away from cancer also; he died about a week ago.  My friend Ks father also passed away from cancer a couple of months ago.  K didnt know my mom passed away til last week, when we talked a little bit about our experiences.  Mel mentioned to me that a new Hyphen staffer on the edit team's mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (my mom had breast cancer).  Crazy.    Ive been toying around with putting together a fundraiser.  I know I want to have a big joint birthday party with Adrienne in September, so maybe that could be it?  Charge like $5 at the door and donate all the proceeds to the American Cancer Society in my moms memory.  Well see.  Anyhow. Sorry to go on about cancer and death so early in the morning.  Hmmm  This morning is the exception, but generally I have this routine of watching the news as I get ready.  I watch local news on Channel 3 and NBCs Today Show.  Yes, I loves me some Matt Lauer.  Um, is it bad that I find Scott Peterson to be attractive?  I mean he's got that tall, dark, handsome, brooding thing going on.  But then again, that whole dark/brooding thing could just be my own personal bias from all the trial coverage Ive seen.  Really, though, hes a good-looking man.  Once I glossed over the cover of a tabloid paper while at the grocery store and the picture of him made me do a double take.  From the angle, I thought he looked like my old USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  They look similar, but my USSCs face isnt so angular and his eyes are more Asian looking (my [old] USSC is hapa/ mestizo /half Asian).  And how about the hot 23-year old teacher who had sex with one of her students?  So Mary Kay Letorneau.  Sounds like the average adolescent males fantasy to me, no?  I thought about itand go ahead and think Im screwed upbut if Mr. Rapp (my 8th grade history teacher) or Mr. Davis (my 12th grade AP History teacher) wanted to seduce me when I was younger  HOLLA!  But its not like at 13 or 16 I wouldve really known what was going on.  Like, Why is your thing all big and sticking straight out?  It looks funny...  You wanna put it in my what?   WHAT!?    Ay naku .  For real.  Yikes.  Aiight, I gotta get back to Hatty about this e-flyer design for the Hyphen event.  And search for these last 11 publications on Bacon's for a big media mailing on Tuesday.  My work is never done.    Have a happy holiday weekend.  Drive safe, eat lots of barbecue, dont use illegal fireworks and blow your hand off, and all that good stuff.  Im spending time with my dad and my crazy aunties (my dads younger sisters) in Milpitas, so you know its ON with the Filipino food!  NUMMIES for me!    "
"       One Week, One Week!  Hello from Kinko's.  I only worked from 11 AM to 3 PM at Panache today; afterwards I headed downtown to the Mother Jones office to drop off six boxes of Hyphen magazines to Yuki (the publisher).  The past three issues, I was the one to pick them up and drop them off to Yuki.  Yuki has the funniest reaction when she sees the magazine for the first time, after it comes back from the printer.  As she turns the pages, her eyes get bigger and bigger and she'll be like, 'Yes!'  The 'yes!' gets louder and louder--I liken it to an orgasm.  With that said: one week til the Hyphen one-year anniversary party!  One week!  One week!  I'm so excited!  Oliver and Mike are spinning!  They're my favorites!  In my old Diaryland I used to refer to Oliver (O-Dub) as 'myyyyy heeerrroooo!'  At Directions In Sound, back in March, he did the best set.  He played Alicia Keys over this rocksteady-reggae sample.  I almost died, it was so good!  And Mike?  Mike's like  kuya  (big brother).  He DJs every event I've ever put together, just about.  I owe him lots of big fat kisses and hugs and dinner and drinks (and more money).  I guess that's why he's called Mike Nice, huh?  Me being me, I'm also worried about numbers (attendance).  I'm always worried about turnout, even if I have a good feeling.  (Like for Hyphen's launch party last year, I knew around 600 heads would turn out, and did.  But I still stressed on it.)  But I think I'm doing better with the worrying--I know everything's locked down.  As far as logistics go, all details are taken care of (or will be).  I meet Adrienne in about forty minutes; we'll do all the decoration shopping at Party City (or whatever it's called) in Daly City.  Adrienne and I are the Dynamic Pinay Duo at Hyphen!  But no more Hyphen talk.  All I ever talk about is work.  Let's talk about  BOYS .  I have a new crush.  I shall think up a good secret name for him, so I can refer to him in my blog, without his knowing.  (You know, just in case he ever reads my blog.)  When I was on Diaryland I referred to my old crush as USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  I had a crush on him for like 5 years (seriously).  I still sort of have a crush on him, but I am open to new crushes (that I might actually do something about).  My new crush is a cutie.  *Swoon!*  I think I might have the guts to flirt with him and be more forward, but sometimes I get too in my head thinking he wouldn't be interested in me.  We're different in a lot of ways, though our circles overlap.  He's older, too.  I'm probably too wannabe ghettofabulous and young for him.  But we could have cute babies, I tell you!  (Oh, who am I kidding?  I'm having lots of fun just swooning, so imagine how I'd react if sex factored into the equation.  Mwahaha!)  Anyhow.  I should go eat before I meet Adrienne.  I've been dying to try Quizno's.  Am I the last person in the world to eat at Quizno's?  I need to eat before I drive out to Daly City and get lost in the rice cooker fog.    "
"       A day of wasting time at work...  Two blogs in one day?      For the past hour or two I've been doing Hyphen stuff and just messing around on this website: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml   Try it out.  Everyone in Hyphen made little icons of themselves.  I didn't get a chance til now.  I dunno if the icon really looks like me, but I tried.  I will figure out how to get my icon on here.  F*** a real picture, it's all about an Audrey gif!  Ha!  Okay.  More media mapping and data entry to do.  I'm here til 6 PM unfortunately.  Boo.    "
"       'Bow-wow'  Listening to: Zero 7 on iTunes Eating: Spinach and cheese crepe.  (Will be washed down with Tums and a bottle of water.)  A lunchtime post, as I am on a break at one of my jobs.  (That's right--ONE of my jobs.  I'm all 'Hey Mon' Jamaican [no offense to Jamaicans] like that skit from In Living Color.)  Some-freaking-body keeps calling my cell from an 'unavailable' number.  I have this policy of not answering such calls unless I'm expecting someone with a blocked # to call me (like Nam).  This person has been calling me the past week, not ONCE leaving a message.  It's getting on my last nerve.  I check my voicemail, dammit!  Leave a message, motherfucker!  Okay.  Rant over.  Everyone involved with Hyphen complains (from time to time) about not being paid for what they do.  I'm totally guilty of this also.  But I realized today, as I spent TWO HOURS emailing press releases (to people who gave in-kind donations, community co-presenters, performers, event posting sites), that I use the Internet at my legit jobs for Hyphen...  It's like I'm getting paid by another company to do Hyphen work.  I need a tshirt that says something like, 'Hyphen Magazine: Keeping it gangsta!'  But only I can wear it.  Because I said so.  So, this morning I drove in to work.  I turned the music up super-loud so I wouldn't have to hear how the tires make a grinding noise when I slow down/stop, because the brake pads are thin.  Yeah, that's pathetic (and probably even 'ghetto'), but so what?  My car is six-years old and it's got almost 200,000 miles on it from all the driving back and forth between Bakersfield/LA and the Bay Area the past four years Mama was doing chemotherapy.  I hope to replace the old green Turtle Mobile SUV with a smaller hybrid Ford Escape (when those finally come out).  (I grew up in the suburbs; I'm all about driving a bigger car since I learned how to drive in a soccer mom minivan.)  Walking to the office, I passed by a wall with a ripped up movie poster on it advertising that Johnson Family Vacation (or whatever) film on it.  I had to laugh because it had Lil Bow-wow on it.  I didn't laugh because of Lil Bow-wow trying to be an actor, but some weird word association thing that comes to mind whenever I hear 'bow-wow' now.  Two weekends ago I was in Milpitas at my Auntie Baby's house (every Filipino has an Auntie Baby).  My Auntie Aurea (like Oreo with an 'a' at the end) was trying to be all cool and tell dirty jokes to us youngsters (my younger cousins and I).  She was telling a joke about 69, but calling it 'bow-wow.'  She sat down on the floor, stuffed animal in her clutches, demonstrating this 'bow-wow' phenomenon.  She bowed her neck so her face was buried in the poor teddy bear's butt/crotch (that's the 'bow' part), then she was like, 'Wow!'  I guess you had to be there to see it and think it was funny.  My cousins and I were laughing hysterically.  My stomach hurt from all the laughing.  Auren (my cousin), Auntie Aurea's daughter, was like, 'MOTHER!'  Yeah.  'Bow-wow.'  All my Ednalino aunties are seriously  bastos  (nasty).  My mom had a bawdy sense of humor too, so I guess I get it from both sides of the family.  Mama's old co-workers used to call her Hot Mama because of it.  There were instances when I was younger, when I would pretend to not understand Tagalog, so I could listen in on the things all the adults would say.  And I had a hard time keeping a straight face during all those ' ay, ka tigas-tigas /Oh, it's so hard!' and  buhok /hair in the  pancit  (noodle dish) jokes.  Ai-ya.    "
"       Listening to: Bittersweeet - DJ Neil Armstrong  Wah!  I'm super-hungry.  (No.  Make that 'hongry!')  I haven't eaten anything at all today; I only drank a cup of coffee.  It's been  that  kind of a day.  Yes.  Busy me.  What did I do today?  So much.  I was at the Panache office today, working my little PR gig.  Working at Panache Communications is pretty fun; definitely a ton of work.  It's high tech PR, so it's totally different than what I'm used to doing with Hyphen or Directions In Sound (music and film) publicity.  Last week I started work on a last minute project, researching media for the Internet media arm of a big (can't name drop--I signed a contract that doesn't allow it) advertising company that just completed the Spanish and Chinese language sites for a major airline (again, can't name drop).  The other week I did analyst research on the wireless/GPS industry, for MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators--think Boost Mobile or Virgin Mobile).  My next project is to write copy for a DM (direct mail) for the Panache PR Pearls e-newsletter.  I am trying to get into high tech/investor relations PR, to compare it with entertainment PR.  Two extremes, I know, but I can't quite figure out what it is I want to do with the skills and experience I have.  Enough PR shop talk.  I know it must be boring to read about.  So...  Earlier this afternoon (after I got off work from Panache), I picked up issue 4 of Hyphen magazine from the printer in South City (that's South San Francisco, for all y'all non-locals).  All 22 boxes fit into my car (back seats pushed down, of course).  My car was so laden down with excess weight, I had to drive like an old lady to my place and drop of 6 boxes before driving to Oakland to drop another 6 boxes off at Melissa's.   Poor green Turtle Power Mobile.  I love you.  You've been so good to me.   Don't worry.  You're getting new tires and break pads this weekend.  :)  Anyhow.  Hyphen issue 4 looks DAMN good, let me tell you.  Vivid colors, nice paper stock, great content.  Oh, and didja know there's gonna be a par-tay on the 9th?  Yeah, stay tuned.  I'll be plug-plugging away...once I get the freaking final draft of the press release done.  (Tonight, I promise!)  I've just been in a strange mood all day.  Mad impatient.  I actually bitched out this car/driver in front of me in traffic today.  I was pissed that I was riding his ass when all of a sudden he decides to parallel park.  I had to wait til all the cars in the lane on my right passed by til I could switch.  Grrr!    I'm sure part of my having a short fuse today has to do with not eating all day, but also just that I woke up early, all annoyed at my landlord's dog.  The damned dog just doesn't know when to shut up.  He (his name is Gino) starts barking, and then the dog next door starts barking...  Sheesh.  When I was unloading boxes of magazines into my storage space this afternoon, Gino started barking at me.  I was about to get my neck-roll on, for real.  Just start swearing at Gino in Taglish: 'Shut the f*** up, Gino!   Lutuin kita, ha /I'll cook you!'  Sometimes I want to grab that dog by the ears and tell him he'll be  adobong na aso  (dog adobo).  Mmmm.  Adobo.  I am so hungry.   Sigh.     "
"        Listening to: So Much Soul (Volume 2) by Vinroc   So I've been pretty busy the past month or so.  Just one thing after another.  Not a bad busy, though.  Today was my day off.  I had a day off last week--the 40th day of mourning since Mama passed away.  I don't know if the 40th day thing is a Filipino or Catholic thing, but I took the day off to reflect on my own, since I'm not Catholic.  I realized last Wednesday that although I still miss Mama terribly, lately (because I've had so much work to do, and have been busying myself by hanging out with my friends) it doesn't  hurt  to miss Mama.  I am still wearing her wedding and engagement rings to remind me of her.  I don't know when I'll be taking them off, but for now I like having the reminder--like she's always with me.  I went to see Fahrenheit 911 today at the Metreon, by myself.  My eyes teared up a few times.    The first instance was in the beginning, before the shots of 9/11 came on, before Michael Moore showed reactions of people watching the planes fly into the WTC.  It brought me back to the trauma of that day, how surreal and scary it was for me, even though I was far removed from it all.  I was grateful Moore didn't show any footage of the planes actually flying into the buildings.  I remember that day--I was at school, watching a TV in the library, and I started crying as I watched people jumping out of windows in the WTC.  The second time I started tearing up during the film was when Moore showed Iraqis condemning American troops and President Bush for killing civilians.  There was an older woman lamenting the senseless death of her brother and the bombing of his home.  It was like she had the same exact words to convey how I feel about the loss of my mom, even though my loss is a result of something different.  Cancer, war--both senseless losses to me.  Mama was a beautiful person who fought for a long time.  I'm still trying to make sense of why she was taken from me.  Yeah, walking out of Fahrenheit 911, I felt really disturbed about American politics/government.  I'm pretty apathetic about politics, but I do my best to stay informed so my opinions aren't half-assed.  During the film was the first time in a long time that I felt really compelled to  do something .  Anyhow.  I just spoke to Daddy today; he's coming up to the Bay Area for the 4th of July holiday weekend.  It will be the first time for him to visit me here since I was a freshman living in the dorm.  Even then, we didn't get to spend time together.  I just remember getting a random call from him that he was in town for a few days.  He came by my dorm and dropped off a TV and VCR for me, gave me some pocket change--and he was gone.    I'm excited--this time I hope to take him out to eat, walk around, whatever.  I didn't get to spend time with him when I was in San Diego at the beginning of the month.  Daddy's not very adventurous about food, and lots of things are  bawal  for him (not good for him to eat; can trigger his gout).  But maybe Daddy will like real Thai food (there's no real Thai food in Bakersfield), or even Burma Superstar?    We'll see.    "
"       My 4th of July weekend got off to a crazy start.  I was supposed to go to work Friday, and make a stop in Millbrae to pick up a newspaper for Eelynn (one of the account supervisors at Panache).  But when I exited onto Highway 1, right by my house, I felt my car jerk and saw the brake light turn red, so I pulled over on the side of the freeway to assess the situation.  When I tried to stop, I had to coast for a bit, and then my brakes were grinding til I completely stopped.  I was on the side of the highway, cars zooming past.  My dad was going to go with me to a mechanic the next day to get new tires and brake pads.  (Does that constitute irony?)  I called AAA to come tow my ass home or to the closest auto shop.  While waiting, some CHP (California Highway Patrol, for those who didn't grow up watching CHiPs) pig rolled up behind me, beeping at me.  Like I was dangerous or some shit, he's all, 'Ma'am, get back in your car, please.'  (I was walking around my car to see if I could tell anything was wrong, fixable.)  I was on the passenger side and sat down in the passenger seat.  Then the cop came up and made this motion, meaning he wanted me to roll down my window and talk to me.  The way I was sitting was awkward, because there were things at the foot of the passenger side, so I had to twist in a funny way to face the officer.  I could tell he was all looking down my blouse.  I was thinking, 'This cop's trying to scope out my titties!'  So I sort of arched my back so my cleavage would be more prominent, thinking, 'Maybe if I give him an innocent look-see, he'll be more efficient and helpful.'  Didn't happen.  I ended up telling the cop that I had already called AAA and someone was coming to tow my shit away within the hour.  The tow truck took me to the closest Firestone, then Firestone told me it would cost over $600 to fix my brakes because my right brake pad fell out and the right rotor (whatever that is) was grinding on metal, so theres a chance they wouldnt have to replace just the rotor on the right side, but the caliper (whatever that is), too.  I called Eugene (my landlord), to see if he could come pick me up, and as we talked more about my car problems, he told me to have my car towed back to the house and his friend would work on it this weekend and only charge me for parts.  (Filipinos always trying to be thrifty and use hook-ups.)  So I had AAA tow my car back (Im a Southern Cali member, so I get more tow mileage allowance), and Eugene had his mechanic friend order new brake pads and rotors for my car (he said it will only cost me $400 even) but  Its Tuesday and my car still has yet to be fixed.  But I fly down to San Diego for a few days tomorrow anyhow.  Doesnt matter.  Ill be back in time (Thursday) to prep for the Hyphen One-Year event at Lamia, and Ill just rent a car for a day or two.  I told Eugene my car HAS to be fixed on Saturday.  Anyhow, Daddy and his two  kumpares  (friends) drove up from Auntie Babys house in Milpitas to pick me up on Saturday morning (they slept at Auntie Babys for the holiday weekend).  They drove me to Milpitas and I got to eat  halo-halo  (hadnt had that in yearsit was so yummy!), crab, lots of pork (cant be Filipino and not eat pork!),  dinuguan  (chocolate meat) and  daing  (fish marinated in vinegar and then deep fried or grilled).  I got annoyed with my aunties because they were telling my dad to tell me to stop wearing my moms engagement and wedding rings.  Theyre concerned about some guy seeing me wearing the rings (on the wrong hand!) and thinking Im married.  But I really dont care about any cock-block action.  No guy (that I would bother looking at twice) has tried to holla at me in the past 6 months anyhow, so Im not tripping.  My minds not even there, really (on guys).  Its definitely not priority.  My aunties are probably worried that Im a lesbian or will become a spinster who forsakes love for career, or something.  (They nag me like, Youre going to be 26 and you dont have a boyfriend?  When are you planning on getting married?  Mama and Daddy brought me up to not to worry about living my life according to some schedule.)  When Im around my aunties I just wont wear the rings.  Aside from these two pictures Ive tucked away in my wallet, they are the only travel sized reminders of Mama that I can take along with me on a daily basis.  In any case, I have a pretty busy week since Ill be in San Diego for a few days and then the Hyphen event is Friday night.  Im going down to San Diego because my dad finally got work orders to go to Japan (my dad works for the Department of DefenseMilitary Sealift Command [hes also retired Navy]), and he leaves for port on Saturday.  I want to spend as much time with him as I can; I wont see him again for another 4-6 months (til around Christmas).  I probably wont be able to communicate with him much except random 3 AM phone calls once or twice a month, and brief emails written in all caps every other week.  When Daddys at work, Ill have nobody to claim toIll be alone in the world  It really makes me miss Mama to think about it that way.   Sigh .  Okay, write again soon.  Hyphen meeting tonight to discuss last minute logistics for our anniversary event and label/package mags to send out to subscribers, then I gotta get home and pack!  Byeeee!    "
"       Where is the Love?  &nbsp;  I was watching the news this morning and so I have some things to comment on:  &nbsp;  Martha Stewart is going to jail for five months.&nbsp; She got an easy sentence for insider trading.&nbsp; Dont get me started on the race/celebrity thing.&nbsp; I could go off on a rambling diatribe, citing OJ Simpson and R Kelly along the way.  &nbsp;  The Philippines is pulling out of Iraq.&nbsp; All 50-some troops.&nbsp; (Yes, Im taking a sarcastic tone.)&nbsp; The Filipino hostage, from what Ive been hearing on the local news, has family in Pacifica (where I live).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Im all in my little bubble, concerned about paying off student loans, moving into a new apartment and furnishing it, buying a new Mac laptop and iPod, turning 26, switching gym memberships, finding a good place to get my hair cut at and bikini waxed&nbsp; Im wondering when my new health insurance will kick in so I can go get my wisdom teeth pulled out&nbsp; My little life is so shallow in comparison to all the other things going on in this world, but it stresses me out nonetheless.  &nbsp;  Sigh.  &nbsp;  Yesterday Eugene (my landlord) was like, Are you really moving out?&nbsp; You havent started packing yet&nbsp; I was like, I dont move til the 28th or 29th and I dont have very much to pack (my room is so small, half my shit has remained packed and stashed away in this storage crawl space beneath my closet).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugenes upset that hes losing a tenant who never seems to be home, keeps to herself, doesnt make a lot of noise and pays her rent/utilities on time.&nbsp; (Yeah, and being Filipino is sometimes a good enough pass with  kababayan  [other Filipinos] for them to trust/favor you.)  &nbsp;  When I moved to Pacifica in April, I put an ad for myself in the seeking a room listings on Craigslist.&nbsp; Adrienne recommended it.&nbsp; She said it would be a lot more efficient because all I had to do was write about how fabulous I am and people would respond, thus Id have the pick of the crop (as far as living situation options).&nbsp; The only places I really liked, that were in my price range, were in Pacifica.&nbsp; I actually wanted to move into a 2-bedroom with another girl my own age (she had a little aquarium with a turtle in it in the living room) just up the street (across from Kenkoyswhere I get Filipino food on the regular), but she took too long to decide and I ended up moving into Eugenes house.  &nbsp;  It hasnt been bad, except once in a while Gino (Eugenes dog) gets on my nerves.&nbsp; And Ive had to totally change my eating habits because I dont have kitchen access (but Eugene provided me a mini fridge and a microwave).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugene and my little Pacifica room served me well for the time I was here.&nbsp; I was gone most of April and May anyhowI was in Bakersfield for like 5 weeks when Mama got sicker and passed away.&nbsp; Although I will miss the free cable, I wont miss the stupid dryer that still didnt dry my clothes after a one-hour permanent press cycle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; I woke up this morning, to a Black Eyed Peas video on VH1.&nbsp; (Id fallen asleep watching TVVH1s I love the 90s series.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me want to rip my ears off--'Hey Mama!'&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; Am I the only Filipino who doesnt think theyre that great just because one of the members if half-Pinoy?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; Last night I finished reading  Sex, Drugs &amp; Cocoa Puffs , so Im open to suggestions for additional reading material.&nbsp; I got started on  The Fall of Advertising &amp; The Rise of PR , but Im off to a slow start because its not as captivating as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Last month I read this self-help book about daughters whose mothers have passed away, and this book by Danzy Senna (she wrote  Caucasia ) called  Symptomatic .&nbsp; Even though I watch a lot of TV and movies, I make sure to&nbsp;read a lot.&nbsp; Must be balanced that way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Speaking of film&nbsp; I was pondering over  Before Sunset , which I saw yesterday after work.&nbsp; Its that film with Ethan Hawke, where he meets up (ten years later) with a woman he met on a train (and spent a night with) in Europe.&nbsp; A lot of the dialogue made me think of my old Ultimate Super Secret Crush (the crush I obsessed over for about 5 years).&nbsp; I started thinking what it might be like if he and I randomly met and hung out in like 5 or 10 years (after no contact for those 5-10 years)what would we talk about?&nbsp; Would being in his presence conjure up all my old crush feelings?  &nbsp;  Crushes suck.&nbsp; When theres a crush situation, usually one person has the upper handnamely the object of the crush, who most likely doesnt have reciprocal feelings.&nbsp; Im always the one with the crush; Ive always felt like this is a handicap, even though Im not one to wear my heart on my sleeve.  &nbsp;  I hope I dont ever speak to, hear from or run into my old USSC.&nbsp; I cant even stand to hear/say his name nowadaysit makes me sad and a bit hurt (angry/bitter).&nbsp; Id much rather hate him now than remember how full of stupidity and hope I was, when I thought I was in (unrequited) love with him or that there was a slight chance he (at one time) might have been interested in me.&nbsp; Hell always be the one that got away, the unresolved unrequited crush, I suppose.  &nbsp;  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&nbsp; I hope you miss me.

"       Sex, Drugs &amp; Shopping Therapy  &nbsp;  Listening to: Tommy Guerrero, yeah!  &nbsp; There's a cute Filipino boy who works at Kinko's, but I have a feeling I'm&nbsp;too old for him.&nbsp; Watch him be like 19 or&nbsp;20 or&nbsp;something.&nbsp; I see him whenever I go&nbsp;to Kinko's in Colma.&nbsp;  Holla! &nbsp; (Yeah, right.) &nbsp; Anyhoo.&nbsp; I had this revelation about 'star-fuckers.'&nbsp; Having worked film festivals the past 5 years, I encounter a lot of people who hope to meet actors and directors--star-fuckers.&nbsp; But me?&nbsp; I've never been starstruck.&nbsp; Not when I met Qbert, not when I met Wayne Wang, not when I met Sandra Oh...&nbsp; However, I recently had a little dose of it.&nbsp; I helped out with the Frameline Film Festival last month (the SF Int'l Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Fest) and the Opening Night film was Touch of Pink.&nbsp; I was working the press line and had to be one girl in a human blockade to prevent starfuckers from trying to ask autographs from Jimmy Mistri and Kyle McLachlan.&nbsp; When Kyle McLachlan stepped out of the limo I was like, 'Wow, he's really tall.&nbsp; He's really handsome.'&nbsp; I thought he looked so regal.&nbsp; I was starstruck for about 15 minutes.&nbsp; And then this weekend Mel and I took my cousins to Amoeba in Berkeley and once I walked in I saw Lyrics Born at the cashier, paying for some CDs.&nbsp; I walked up to him and said, 'Hi, Tom.'&nbsp; Not that I expected him to remember that I used to intern at Quannum in 1998, or this exchange we had about me jocking his 'Palm P.' But... &nbsp; I forget what my point is.&nbsp; Let's move on. &nbsp; I&nbsp;have been watching lots of movies this&nbsp;week (it's only Thursday), going after work (because I get off early enough to catch matinees).&nbsp; So far this week I've seen Anchorman, Saved! and today I saw Before Sunset.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realized that my whole movie kick is because I'm feeling down. &nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I've been super-tired since&nbsp;this week started.&nbsp; Like all the hectic Hyphen stuff is over, my dad arrived in Japan on Sunday night--there's nothing more for me to really focus&nbsp;all my energy on anymore, for me to avoid feeling sad again about my mom.&nbsp; I know I'm depressed when I eat shitty foods and all I want to do is sleep (or my sleeping habits&nbsp;change--I've been falling asleep at 10:30 PM the past few nights,&nbsp;and waking up at 2 or 3 AM, then going back to sleep til abouta 7 AM) or shop. &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; It'll surpass, I know.&nbsp; Just takes time... &nbsp; I feel&nbsp;a strange tickle in my throat, indicating the onset of a cold.&nbsp; You know that feeling, when it hurts to swallow?&nbsp; Sometimes I think thats worse than actually having a cold.  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; Some retard tried to talk to me at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Colma yesterday.&nbsp; I was walking around the magazine section, trying to find Fast Company, and lo and behold an IT-looking white guy (you know what Im talking about) locks me on his Pinay Radar.&nbsp;  Why does it always have to be skanky, greasy-haired, IT-looking white guys who like Filipinas?&nbsp;  WHY?    &nbsp;  Acting cool and oblivious, I took my stack of magazines and sat down in Starbucks with an iced soy mocha.&nbsp; The guy sat down at an empty table across from me and struck up a conversation.&nbsp; The guy mentioned something about how hes totally into CHRIS ISAAK.&nbsp; How he used to be an avid watcher of The Chris Isaak Show on HBO, how Chris Isaak is considered geeky because hes misunderstood and people only remember that video he did with Helena Christensen.&nbsp; I wasnt sure if I was being testedwas this guy being for real?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didnt want to find out.&nbsp; I was like, Peace out, dude.&nbsp; I was outta there with the quickness.  &nbsp;  HOW is it that the guys who try to talk to me are always dorky, desperate, socially inept white IT-looking guys?&nbsp; Oh, and lets not forget homelesshomeless men love harassing me.&nbsp; One time on Haight Street, I walked by this homeless guy who was like, Come on baby, Ill show you a good time.&nbsp; He made these air-humping gestures, flicking his tongue out in that lascivious (I wanna eat you out) sort of way, chanting, Pussy!&nbsp; Pussy!&nbsp; Ugh.  &nbsp;  So back to my pining: Why cant the guys I find attractive be attracted to me?&nbsp; Why cant I get chatted up by guys who have all their teeth, who dont look like greasy IT guys with Filipina fetishes, or guys who look like a crackhead/pimp character from a Dave Chapelle skit?&nbsp; Why are the guys I like not interested in me, only want to be my friend, already attached, or gay?&nbsp; Ive been asking myself these questions for 25 years now.  &nbsp;  About nine months ago I was talking to this guy from Virginia who I met really randomly (translation: online/Friendster).&nbsp; He was totally different than mehe listened to mainstream alternative (think Hoobastank and Incubus) and worked for some tech company based in SF that always had him out in the field (Dallas for two weeks, London for one week, etc., etc.).&nbsp; He was a Good Southern Boy who was in a frat in collegea frat where he had lots of Filipino pledge brothers, and so he developed a thing for hot, petite Pinay girls.&nbsp; He would tell me, in mangled Tagalog,  Maganda ka /Youre pretty.  Can you say GROSS!?  &nbsp;  Ben (that was his name) tried to sway me to be more understanding; accused me of being REVERSE RACIST.&nbsp; I was like, First of all, you cant talk race or racism with methats what my whole college experience was about.&nbsp; And second of all, Im not racist, Im CAUTIOUS.&nbsp; I mean, if you were me and some white guy found out what ethnicity you were, then reacted like, Oh my God, youre Filipina?&nbsp; Filipinas are totally HOT! wouldnt you be freaked out, too?&nbsp; I mean, could you be more obvious about being excited to dabble in Otherness?&nbsp; I want someone to like me because they like ME and not my Filipino-ness.&nbsp; (I should mention that it didnt help when Ben admitted to me, after I asked him if hed ever dated any Asian/Filipina girls, that he hadnt because theyd all prefer to be his friend.&nbsp; Gee, I wonder why.)  &nbsp;  Where oh where is a cute, smart, ambitious, hip, self-deprecating Asian or hapa guy for moi?&nbsp; Someone who finds my neuroses amusing?&nbsp; Someone who can hold his own when introduced to my crazy family (that sounds so  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , I know)?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I want cute little Asian babies, like the one Angelina Jolie adopted.&nbsp; Can I specifically ask for Asian sperm if I opt for artificial insemination because nobody likes me?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sometimes I fear that Im doomed to be single the rest of my life.&nbsp; (Thats not necessarily a bad thing, I knowall my aunties think if I end up single its because Im some career-minded Type A bitch.)&nbsp; For Valentines Day next year, while all my friends are out on dates, Im going to have to go to that one gay male strip club my friend told me about where you can grab on The D for $30 admission.&nbsp; I think its called Knob Hill or its in Nob Hill, or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Okay, Im totally babbling right now.&nbsp; I've been writing so much lately; I need to stop. &nbsp; Sigh.

"       Pimp My Ride, Just Like Jessica Simpson  This weekend I got sized for a new bra at Victorias Secret.  I was rocking out in the fitting room with all the bras the sales girls handed to me to try on, living out my wannabe video girl fantasies.  They were playing Justin Timberlake (Like I Love You with The Clipse) and Beyonce (Naughty Girl), so you can imagine all the solo dance routines and lip-synching that ensued in front of my dressing room mirror.  But more on that later  I went to see Anchorman yesterday afternoon.  I dunno how I feel about Will Ferrell.  Im not sure if I think hes funny or stupid, but I was in the mood to laugh.  The film was worth the $6.75 for a matinee.  I held back from seeing Spiderman 2 because Yvette and I made plans to see it this Saturday.    Blah.  Countdown, peoples!  Two and a half weeks before I move out of my little Pacifica room, to a Lake Merritt (Lake Merritt is near downtown Oakland) walk-up with hardwood floors and lots of closet space.  Im moving in with Melissa (the editor of Hyphen and fellow Turtle Lover).  Im so excited!  Ill be an East Bay Area-n again!  Mel and I are both turtle girls, and anal retentive about cleanliness and organization, so I think were a good match.  I have a feeling well be talking (bitching) a lot about Hyphen, not to mention harboring tons of Hyphen crap in our big hallway closet, but  I finally get to live in a really nice place, with someone I am friends with (as opposed to strangers I found/who found me on Craigslist).  J  Most importantly, I get to cook again!  Ive gone the past three months living off of take out, so Im dying to cook adobo, garlic fried rice and spamsilog (spam and eggs over rice)!  Yay!  Anyhow.  Im enjoying my new bras.  HA! This weekend my cousins were visiting from San Diego, so I took them down to Valley Fair mall in Santa Clarathe upscale mall where they have Coach and Tiffanys.  I got fitted for a bra, which Id never bothered to do before.  I highly recommend that every woman does ityou might find that youre not the size youve been buying all these years.  The past 18 months my weight has gone(mostly) up and down and Ive fluctuated from a 34B up to a 36C.  I was starting to feel cinched in by my bra; when I got sized this weekend, I was told that I am now a 36D.  (Holla!)  I was thinking, 36D?  You mean I have Jessica Simpson boobies?  (I only know what bra size she wears because I read too many trashy Cosmo type mags.)  I think the letter D just freaks me outthe boobage seems excessive.  When I look down at my chest, I dont think my boobs look  that  big.  Ive never been flat and Im not ever going to have Pamela Anderson super-tits, but a C sounds more like me than a D.  Maybe I should rethink this gotta drop some weight before my brothers wedding thing?  Im just trippin off girl stuff.  Scuse me.  Somewhere in this world someone will worship my breastesses (B, C or D cup) and appreciate that I pay top dollar for my bras.  And hey, at least Im all natural!  (Mwahaha!)  Moving on  The Hyphen party.  Sigh.  Me having the experience of putting on all sorts of events, I am always prepared for last minute everything to go wrong.  And everything DID go wrong, but the party went onand I looked cute (cuteness is all that matters, right?) in my new outfit.  I was tugging at my top all night, but at least my boobs (it's all about my boobs, isn't it?) looked good, and Adrienne did my makeup.  Talk about hotness on Hyphen staff--all of us (staff is like 90% female) were cute.  At least I felt cute for a little bit.  Whether or not I really was cute, is relative.  But I think I shall invest in my own DJ set-up so I can not only mess around with records, but have my own equipment for DJ emergencies (to avoid all the last minute calling of DJs to bring needles or slipmats because the club didnt provide that shit).  But enough of that.  Blah.  I drove my cousins Johanna, Jamie and Jeremy back to San Diego on Sunday (I flew back to SF late Sunday night).  It was my first time to do that drive (as the driver) from the Bay Area.  I did the drive in 7 hours, doing like 85-90 (at times 95).  The three youngsters slept in the car the whole trip.  I drank an energy drink (I forget what it was called, but it was half the size of a Red Bull, and tasted like a Sprite), a cup of coffee, and then (later on) half a Red Bull.  Didnt feel tired at all during the drive, though at times I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my chest.  I stopped in Bakersfield, to visit Mamas grave.  It was my first time to be back in Bakersfield since her ashes were buried in May.  I bought her a card and two bouquets of flowers.  I had barely spotted the headstone to her grave and I started bawling.  It was like at the mortuary chapel when we had her Last Mass/viewingmy cousins and I were the first ones to arrive and I only made it halfway down the aisle towards Mamas open casket, when I started bawling.  For some reason I cant talk to Mama out loud, like what I have to say to her is private (not that talking to her out loud or in general makes me feel silly).  I talk to Mama in my head and hope that she hears me.  I sat next to her grave, brushing the dirt off the headstone and arranging the flowers, talking to her in my head.  It really got to me that on the headstone, next to her name was my dads.  I dont want to have to think about another death for at least 15 years.  In any case, I was all spoiled from Thursday to Sunday.  I had a rental car, because my car didnt get fixed til Sunday.  My cousins and I were mobbing around in a white Chevy Trailblazer.  I thought itd be about the same size as my Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but it was HUGE.  Im really proud that I was able to maneuver the Trailblazer and its 270-horse power engine.  I truly felt like a shrimpy Asian girl who could barely see over the dashboard (Im just a centimeter shy of 53)driving a big-ass car is like my Napoleon complex or some shit.  I like SUVs, even though I know theyre not gas efficient.  I grew up in white suburbia and my first car was my moms minivan, so anything smaller than a Toyota Camry just wont do for moi.  Driving the rental car made me realize how old and uncool my car is, even though its a 1998 model.  I was like, Keyless entry?  DOPE!  CD player?  OhmyfreakingGOD!  My car doesnt even have power locks or windows, because I was cheap and got standard everything.  But now standard  IS  keyless entry, power locks/windows, a CD player, etc.  Yeah, I cannot wait to get a new car.  I have other bills to take care of first.  Enough babble.  This girls got work to do.  Ugh.    "
"       My Neck, My Back   (7/14 note: I wrote this yesterday afternoon, with the intention of uploading it right away, but I got distracted and ended up saving it as a draft.)   Sheesh.  The fact that I am still recovering from my weekend (make that my whole week) must be a testament to how old Im getting.  I know Im only 25 (going on 26, come September), but  Shit.  My back and neck still hurt, though not as bad as on Sunday.  Lately Ive been having neck and back painif that doesnt scream old, then I dont know what does.  I dont know if the cause is any of the following: bigger boobs (from weight gain), bad posture, or sleeping in a bad position.  But the pain can be seriously debilitating.  When its really bad, Ill feel sore for 2-4 days and I cant lean forward more than a 45-degree angle, I cant turn my head, and sudden, jerky movements cause me pain.   Aray ko , for real.    Anyhow.  Flew down to San Diego out of SFO early Wednesday morning (last week).  Got picked up by my cousin Aurens boyfriend and then dropped off at Auntie Erlings and Uncle Johnnys.  I got fed, watched TFC (The Filipino Channel) variety shows for a bit, and napped for like 2 hours, cozy in clean linens that used to be mine.  When Im at Auntie Erlings, Auntie Tetens, or Auntie Babys houseI always spot some knick-knack, blanket/throw pillow, or piece of furniture that used to belong to my family (my mom).  When my dad and I were preparing for Mamas death, we agreed that although I would inherit the house, my brother would move in and live there until he got married next year.  So Daddy and I put stuff into storage.  The things I didnt want/need, I gave to my aunties.  Whenever I visit any of my aunties Im always thinking, Hey, I recognize that!  When I was younger, all my cousins got my hand-me-downs (like this pink Huffy banana seat bike I used to love), so in a way Im glad all of Mamas things are still in the family (didnt get thrown away).  I spent a little time with my dad at Auntie Tetens before he went back to his hotel (when youre old like my dad, and its not basketball season anymore, you dont bother to stay up past 9:30 PM).  We ate  sinigang  (a seafood stew flavored with tamarind) and my dad lectured me for like 10 minutes about emailing him, or calling my aunties if I need anything while hes in Japan. Afterwards, my cousins (Jamie and Johanna) and I went over to our other cousin (Warren)s house in Chula Vista.  I should call him  Kuya  (big brother) Warren, huh?  (I hope Warren doesnt mind that I dont call him  kuya .)  Anyhow.  Warrens mom and my dad are cousins, so I dunno what that makes Warren and me, but Ill say cousins to keep it simple.  Its all Ednalino blood.  Warrens actually closer to my brothers age (early 30s) and his younger brother (Dave) and I used to play together when our families were stationed in Virginia Beach in the mid-80s.  I remember we used to watch Captain Caveman and He Man on the USA Cartoon Express, and his mom (my Auntie Nenet) got me hooked on Bar None candy bars (I wish they still made those).  So yeah, if you havent figured it out already, I have a freaking huge family.  ON BOTH SIDES!  My dad is like the fourth oldest of ten; my mom was the oldest of (I think) 8.  Unfortunately I dont know my Pasig (moms) side very well, so when I talk about my cousins, I mean all my Ednalino cousins (in Cali [San Diego and Milpitas]; I have some cousins in Hawaii and Australia).    Because some of my cousins have kids, and some of their kids are starting to have kids, I think Im like a great aunt already.  Is that right?  Ive never been able to figure out how all that lineage stuff works.  For example, is Robby, my  Kuya  Dongs 19-year old son (an older cousin of mine), my nephew, or is he my second cousin?  Regardless, all the youngsters address me as  ate /big sister (ah-teh) anyhow.  Heaven forbid anyone calls ME auntie anytime soon.  Hell-fucking-no.  I didnt grow up close to my family on either side.  Partly because when my dad was in the Navy, we got transferred around a lot, but mostly because my mom didnt get along with her inlaws.  I saw my dads side every couple of years, after we moved back to California from Virginia in like 1989.  Before Mama passed away, the last time Id seen my dads side of the family was when I was 19when my  lola  (grandmother) died.  The last six weeks or so that Mama got really sick, up until she passed away, my dads family came by every weekend for almost a month straight.  Now were getting re-acquainted.  I feel like Im making up for lost time.    Sometimes I say thought-prayers in my head to Mama and I tell her that although I know she didnt get along with daddys sisters, I hope she isnt mad at me for turning to them in her absence.  I am always loyal, but I love my aunties too.  It literally takes all of them to equal one of her.  Considering the tumultuous relationship Mama had with her inlaws, I think Mama would find it funny and ironic to hear me admit this.  But its true, and I know she would agree.  I have cousins I havent met yet, and cousins whose names Im still trying to keep straight.  I have cousins nearing 50, and cousins still under 15.  Its weird for me to have to address people as  kuya  (big brother) and  ate  (big sister), and to be addressed as  Ate  Audrey.  When my cousin Auren called me  Ate  a few months ago, I didnt respond to her.  I didnt think she was talking to me because Im not used to being called that.  But now I like it.  Ednalino to me was always just my dad, my mom, my brother and me.  But now its this greater network of aunties and uncles and cousins, and being called  ate  makes me feel like I belong to a club.  I have crazy, loud aunties who cackle when they laugh, who have  bastos  (dirty) senses of humor; my uncles all kick it in the backyard, next to the barbecue grill, smoking too many cigarettes, drinking beer and Hennessey while eating  pulutan  (snacks); most of my younger cousins are girls and theyre all so HOT, Im jealous.  Anyhow, I have things to do, so until next time!  I am going to look at all the Hyphen anniversary pics online and I won't forward you the links because I am so not photogenic (but I swear I was cute that night!).    "
"       How cute.&nbsp; One of my former students, Fam Seng, IM'd me.&nbsp; She just got her first cell phone.&nbsp; (I was her mentor/tutor when she was 13.&nbsp; She'll be starting her senior year of high school in the fall.)&nbsp; I told her I'm moving back to the East Bay next week and she's excited like, 'Can we have sleepovers again?'&nbsp; (I used to have all my girls over for sleepovers--that's probably the only reason they liked me.)&nbsp; She's got her driver's permit and she claims she's taller than me now.  Makes me feel so old!  Last night I gave Yuki a ride home after the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; After I dropped her off she called me, telling me she left her phone in her car.&nbsp; To be sure, I called it and I heard the chime/ring, but it took me forever to figure out where in my car it was because it fell inbetween the passenger seat and the middle console.&nbsp; I met&nbsp;Yuki downtown&nbsp;and dropped her phone off earlier this afternoon.  After last night's meeting I had a quick talk with Donna, to touch base on what her next project/s will be and what kinds of things she'd like to work on.&nbsp; Donna was just recently voted onto staff, after being a 'fellow' (intern) for three/four months.&nbsp; She originally wanted to be on the Edit Team, but her background is in marketing, so she had a better 'fit' with Business Team.&nbsp; She was officially voted on as my 'assistant' (at least as far as marketing/publicity goes).&nbsp; It's strange--I've never had to manage anyone (not like this, at least).&nbsp; I tend to be a Control Freak who, as a result of her control-neuroses, spreads herself too thin.&nbsp; What I need to do, is give Donna the benefit of the doubt that she can complete whatever tasks I assign to her, and do them on deadline.&nbsp; I wear two hats for Hyphen, so when I'm busy with event crap, I need an assistant to pick up the slack with administrative duties for marketing/publicity projects.&nbsp; I should take Donna out for dinner/drinks every so often, so she doesn't feel like I'm just a Micro-Managing Taskmaster...  Blah.  I wrote Mel two checks last night--one to pay out the deposit to her outgoing roommate Barbara, and one for August rent made out to our landlord.&nbsp; It  hurt  me to part with that money; I kissed my two checks before I handed them to Mel.&nbsp; Like, 'Bye-bye money!'&nbsp; But a week from now I am out of Pacifica!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp;  Tomorrow night&nbsp;a bunch of us will be hanging out with C.Fan (Chris Fan).&nbsp; Chris used to be with Hyphen, then&nbsp;he left for NYC for grad school.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;when I drink tomorrow, I don't feel all funky like I did at Milk Wednesday.&nbsp;  Okay, have a good weekend.&nbsp;     "
"        White Men Cant Dance    &nbsp;  Trebuchet MS is my favorite font.&nbsp; Do normal people have favorite fonts?&nbsp; It used to be Verdana, but now I think it's too wide.&nbsp; I'm a dork.    &nbsp;  Hyphen freaking general meeting tonight.&nbsp; Do you KNOW how much I HATE general meetings?&nbsp; (At least we don't have much&nbsp;of a biz team anymore, so we&nbsp;haven't had a biz team meeting in months.)&nbsp; I wanted to ditch tonight&nbsp;and go to Alameda--to hang out with Tim, Geraldine, Nina, Rachel and Steve (I used to call them the '594 Kids'), to ride around in Tim's new boat.&nbsp; I hadn't kicked it with all those kids (as a group--I always see everyone separately) in a loooong time.    &nbsp;  But I realized that tonight is our 'post-mortem' (we go over and analyze) of our anniversary event and how can the Event Planner miss that?&nbsp; And then I also realized that I'm going to be moving in with the Editor In Chief next Thursday--there will be no missing of meetings or lying about something to do (when it's really just goofing off) from here on out.&nbsp; Mel will kick my ass, she's so hardcore!&nbsp; You don't wanna make her mad...&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; (Love ya, Mel!)    &nbsp;  Sigh.    &nbsp;  Anyhoo.    &nbsp;  Yesterday started out a bad day and ended with a fabulous Girls Night Out.  I checked my messages at the right time yesterday, because I got an email from my friend Marky about a party (his crew) Massive Selector was throwing at Milk for The Roots album release of  Tipping Point .&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasnt going to go; I was planning on going to this bar called Hush Hush tonight (after the Hyphen meeting), where Marky and my other friend Ren would be spinning.&nbsp; Then I thought, Why not go to Milk?&nbsp; So I called Adrienne and we were like, Are you going?&nbsp; Do you want to go?&nbsp; Then we were like, If you go, Ill go.&nbsp; So we both went.&nbsp; And Hatty came with.&nbsp;   It was good.&nbsp; I got to touch base with Erik (the owner of Milk), who Id been meaning to talk to forever, since Directions in Sound (it was at Milk this year).&nbsp; Right after the NAATA film festival ended, the following week I was in Bakersfield off and on til mid-May, so I never got to debrief with Erik about how he/we felt Directions In Sound went at Milk.&nbsp; And I want to talk to him about doing a birthday party/fundraiser in early October, too.  Erik was walking out and I was like, Hey! He stopped, smiled at me and said, Give me a hug!&nbsp; Hatty and Adrienne were like, Whoa, Audrey!&nbsp; You go, mama!&nbsp; (Eriks totally fly, but hes married with child.)&nbsp; Erik and I had a cigarette outside and we chatted a bit.&nbsp; He told me it was his birthday and I was like, Happy Birthday!&nbsp; How old are you?&nbsp; 30?&nbsp; 32?&nbsp; He was like, 33&nbsp; And so I said, The same age Jesus was when he was crucified.&nbsp; Erik was like, See, thats what Im talking about.&nbsp; It was such a random conversation that somehow ended up making sense.  Ade, Hatty and I started off the night with a round of Purple Hooters shots, on me.&nbsp; Then we posted in a booth along the wall, checking everyone out and grooving in our seats.&nbsp; Adrienne was like, If you see anyone cute, point them out and Ill rate them.&nbsp; The only guy I thought was sort of cute/interesting, was this stocky Filipino guy wearing a Zoo York shirt and a neat hat, who was really grooving/singing along to the reggae/dancehall that Rob was spinning.&nbsp; Adrienne gave him a 7 and then said, He looks like a nice person.&nbsp; He looks like he loves his mom very much.&nbsp; More randomness.  Hatty bought Ade and I Long Island Iced Teas.&nbsp; She didnt get a drink for herself because she saw the bartender grab like ten different liquors to make one Long Island, and it freaked her out.&nbsp; For good reason, toothat drink fucked me up.&nbsp; I was barely half-way when I started feeling like it was hard to breathe and my heart was beating faster.&nbsp; But I drank more and then stepped out to have a cigarette (fresh air).&nbsp; My tolerance is definitely not what it was just three or four months ago.  This band, I think they were called Alphabet Soup, played live and had two emcees and a DJ accompanying them.&nbsp; They were dope.&nbsp; They started playing when Ade, Hatty and I were in the ladies room, and I thought it was actually The Roots CD, but it was the bandthey were that good.&nbsp;   There was this weird South Asian (maybe Middle Eastern) guy who was trying to infiltrate our dancing threesome all night.&nbsp; Ade, Hatty and I started out dancing where the bar turns into the dancefloor.&nbsp; We moved closer to the stage and were just grooving, and this strange guy (holding a beer and exclaiming, Heeeeey!) tries to freak me from behind.&nbsp; When I turn towards Hatty, he then tries to freak Adrienne.&nbsp; Basically, whenever he came close to our group, hed try to freak all of us (one by one), or get in the middle of our dancing circle.&nbsp; At one point in the night, he was all, Heeey! and had one hand on mine and Hattys headsI thought he was going to like stroke our hair or pat us on the heads like puppies.&nbsp; RANDOM.&nbsp; The guy tried to freak all three of us when Ades friend Alex was watching, and so he started laughing and walking away.&nbsp; Adrienne grabbed his arm and made him stand by us.&nbsp; He was like, Thats why you need to bring someone to cock-block.&nbsp; I was joking around like, Thats my jobIm protecting these two, and he was like, You?&nbsp; Suuuure.&nbsp; Then he walked away again, leaving us near the crazy Heeeey! guy.&nbsp; So we went back to our original booth and sat there til we went home.  So like, whats up with all the seriously OLD WHITE GUYS who were in attendance?&nbsp; Adrienne says the event was posted up on Craigslist, so maybe thats a factor, but&nbsp; It was Play that funky music, whiteboy night or some shit.&nbsp; White men cant dance, Im sorry.    Geez.&nbsp; When I finish this, that means I'm off to my meeting.&nbsp; I don't wanna go...      "
"        Adjustment Period     &nbsp;   Since my weekend post about karaoke, I've been having this great exchange over email with Todd about fun songs to sing.&nbsp; All I have to say is, 'We like the cars, the cars that go boom!'     &nbsp;   I almost forgot to mention that when Mel, Sorcha, Vette and I did karaoke last weekend, I tried my hand at 'I Just Wanna Love Ya' by Jay-Z.&nbsp; Yes, folks, I tried to be both Jay-Z and Pharrell in the same song.&nbsp; It's quite hard when you have to be all, '...only if you ride nice dick' and then be all, 'Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff.'     &nbsp;   Anyhow.     &nbsp;   It's only Wednesday, but I've been having a hard week.&nbsp; I noticed today, as I drove around running errands after work, that I really just wanted to cry.&nbsp; I was in rush hour traffic and all I wanted to do was stop my car, get out and sit in the backseat and cry in the privacy of tinted windows.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was thinking about this joke Daddy played on Mama a few months ago.&nbsp; He was crouched down, tying her shoe for her, and he started doing the 'ocho-ocho' dance.&nbsp; Unless you're Filipino, that's probably not funny.&nbsp; So far every day this week I've felt like crying because I miss Mama--because I think of something about her that I miss.     &nbsp;   I'm really scared for my birthday to come.&nbsp; Mama was always the first one to call me up and greet me.&nbsp; Mama's birthday card was always the first to arrive.&nbsp; I'm scared for Christmas to come--I'm still beating myself up over not spending Christmas in Bakersfield last year.&nbsp; I feel so guilty that Mama spent Christmas alone (with my  lola /grandmother) and I had an orphan's Christmas with my friends, because I figured I'd go home for New Year's anyhow.     &nbsp;   Everyone keeps telling me that this first year without Mama will be all about adjusting to her absence.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to adjust period.

"       Golden  &nbsp;  Woke up this morning to the TV blaring, because I feel asleep with it on last night.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; For some reason the TV was on ESPN (what&nbsp;did I watch last night?) and it was some final series for pool at a casino/resort&nbsp;in Connecticut.&nbsp; The two dueling it out, to move on to the final round, were both Filipino.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't have my glasses on, but I heard the names Efren and Bustamante and I&nbsp;shot up in bed to see if my Filipino Radar is still on point.&nbsp;  Of course it is.   &nbsp;  Anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the best moment Friday afternoon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After work I decided to treat myself to an ice cream cone.&nbsp; I was just sitting on a stool, watching people walk by, when the new Jill Scott song Golden comes on.&nbsp; Im licking up my ice cream, grooving along, and then I bite into the coneit tasted like fried chicken.  &nbsp;  I dont know why, but I thought that was such a profound moment.&nbsp;  My ice cream cone tasted like fried chicken. &nbsp; Every once in a while I have my own strange semi-  American Beauty , plastic-bag-twirling-around-in-the-wind sort of moments that I think are really profound in their silliness.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   You're one weird-ass girl, Audrey.   &nbsp;  I got a call from Uncle Johnny this weekend.&nbsp; Now that Mama is gone and Daddy is in another country, I feel pretty lonely at times.&nbsp; It was nice of Uncle Johnny to call, just to say Hi.&nbsp; He put Auntie Erling on the phone and she addressed me as Audeng (sounds like awww dang!).&nbsp; My parents used to call me thatmostly Mama did.&nbsp; It makes me sad to think that Mamas not here to call me that nickname anymore.  &nbsp;  There are a lot of things about Mama that I miss.&nbsp; I still cant believe that shes gone sometimesit still feels like a strange dream that I should wake up from.&nbsp; And sometimes I feel guilty because I dont feel sad 24-7 like I did the first two weeks after she passed away.&nbsp; Like I feel as if I should be super-depressed and sad and crying all the time to properly mourn her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know theres no blueprint to the mourning processeveryone goes through the motions in their own way, on their own time.&nbsp; The first two weeks after I returned from Bakersfield, after Mama passed away, I didnt want to go out or talk to anyone.&nbsp; I wanted to cry all the time, and I probably cried at least once a day in those first two weeks.&nbsp; I was an anti-social hermit girl.&nbsp; I went to work and went home and watched TV til I fell asleep.&nbsp; Then I got busy with work and Hyphen and I was hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as of last Sunday that phase ended, so now Im sort of reverting to the watching-TV-til-I-pass-out phase.&nbsp; I don't like having time to feel sad, and my sadness manifesting in really unhealthy ways (neck pains, insomnia, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope Daddys coping better.&nbsp;       "
"       Axl Rose + Muppet/Fraggle = Melissa Hung  &nbsp;  Instead of going to see Spiderman 2 with Yvette last night, we did karaoke in Japantown with Mel and her friend (visiting from Houston) Sorcha (I hope I spelled that right).  &nbsp;  I met Mel and Sorcha in Oakland for a craft fair.&nbsp; I get tired of that whole dirty punk rock/artist scene real quick, but I came away with cool things (a turtle-shaped pin, a flower pin, and a pair of dangly earrings).&nbsp; Then we hung out in Lake Merritt, walking in and out of (overpriced) shops while drinking our iced coffees from Peets.&nbsp; Yvette met us at 7 PM for Cambodian food at Battambang, a restaurant I really like, that I had sworn off for about a year.&nbsp; (Its half a block away from the art gallery a certain person [I dont get along with anymore, who is an ex-friend and ex-roommate] works [or used to work] at.&nbsp; Dont ask.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After dinner, we killed time at Mels (my soon-to-be home), trying to coordinate with people to join us for karaoke.&nbsp; More people, more fun, right?&nbsp; Melissa was like, We should call Todd!&nbsp; But then she was like, But Todds really busy; he probly wouldnt come anyway.&nbsp; I figure, Todds old (haha, Todd) and who in their right mind would drive all the way up to SF from San Jose just for karaoke anyhow?&nbsp; (Oh, but Todd is someone I would love to do drunken karaoke with.&nbsp; I know hed be fun!&nbsp; Oliver Wangs on my Karaoke Wish List, too!)  &nbsp;  While at Mels, Adrienne kept texting me, and I texted her back (I know, thats just so Filipino of us).&nbsp; But then I got impatient, and at the urging of Mel, Vette and Sorcha, I finally called.&nbsp; Its just so hard to coordinate among so many people.&nbsp; There was some party Stef was going to, that she and Adrienne wanted us to go to also, and the theme was to wear Puma and Adidas.&nbsp; But our foursome (Mel, Vette, Sorcha and moi) wasnt in the socializing mood.&nbsp; We wanted to be clique-ish (inside joke for Mel, Stef, Adrienne, me and a couple other Hyphenators) and not have to make nice with strangers.&nbsp; So we crossed the bridge to have a round of drinks at Rohan (really cool soju bar) then karaoked our little hearts out for an hour and a half.  &nbsp;  Ohmygod!&nbsp; Melissa is the Hair Metal Karaoke Queen!&nbsp; I thought my friend Pete did the best Axl Rose, but Melissa fucking rocks because shes a girl and she totally belts it out.&nbsp; I mean, I already adore Melissa, but now I have added respect for her karaoke skills.&nbsp; She did Skid Row (18 &amp; Life), Bon Jovi (You Give Love A Bad Name) and Guns N Roses (Welcome To The Jungle).&nbsp; Melissa was scoring really high, getting 93s and 98s.&nbsp; The song where she really kicked ass (18 &amp; Life) and shouldve scored 100, the machine scored her as a 0.&nbsp; I think she broke the karaoke machine with all of her talent.  &nbsp;  I was upset that the two songbooks we were choosing tunes from didnt have any of my signature songs.&nbsp; No When I Think of You (Janet Jackson), no Stay (Lisa Loeb), no Always (Atlantic Starr), no Tell Me Something Good (Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan).&nbsp; I had to make do and rock some Genie in a Bottle by Christina Aguilera, Never Gonna Give You Up (Rick Astleyinvoking the spirit of Gary Chou!) and Careless Whisper (George Michaeldedicated to Yuki).  &nbsp;  We ended the night with a group songcant remember if it was Journey or Foreigner but it was the I wanna know what love is song.&nbsp; We were all just screaming into the mics, we didnt care.&nbsp; On the drive home, we were reeling off what BASIC songs the karaoke binders didnt have (that they should have), and what songs wouldve been fun to do as a group.&nbsp; I saw Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen) in the binder, but was too intimidated to program it.&nbsp; Dont frontyou KNOW that would be fun to do.&nbsp; It must be that Filipino performer-mimic gene in me, but I loves me some karaoke.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Alright now, I gotta go return some impulse buys from Bath &amp; Body Works.&nbsp; (Who needs 3 scented lotions, even if they are $3.33 each?)

"       Food Orgasm at Kenkoys  &nbsp; I've been getting&nbsp;complaints the past week that people can't/couldn't comment to my posts unless they&nbsp;had Blogs themselves.&nbsp; I fixed that, so if you're not a Blog member, you can post anonymously.&nbsp; I like the comments people have been forwarding to me, but I also think it'd be more fun to share them with whoever else reads this.&nbsp; Everyone (so far as I know) who reads my&nbsp;blog (I can&nbsp;only think of like&nbsp;five or six people who I know read it) is nice.&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; I had the best breakfast/brunch in the whole wide world this morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Im always on this quest for good Filipino food because I havent had a chance to eat it on the regular in about five years (since my mom first got cancer).&nbsp; I guess its sort of a quest to recapture the food from my happy childhood, but more just seeking out a good Filipino food surrogate.&nbsp; You knowcomfort.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ive eaten my dads cooking and my aunties cookingbut nobody cooks the way my mom did. &nbsp;If Mama was still alive, she wouldve been able to kick your moms ass in the kitchen with a  sandok  and  palayok , word up.  &nbsp;  I think I just might have found my most favorite Filipino caf/restaurant.&nbsp; And thats quite a thing to say, considering that I generally turn my nose at Filipino food establishments.&nbsp; I think a lot of Filipinos might feel the same waythat you shouldnt bother eating Filipino food at  turo-turo  (literally point-point where the food sits pre-cooked, stewing under a heatlamp) mom-n-pop joints.  &nbsp;  This morning I had longsilog (pork sausage and eggs over garlic fried rice).&nbsp; It was super-duper nummies.&nbsp; Kenkoys dont mess aroundthey cook your food to order.&nbsp; They even make the food all nice and pretty on the plate. &nbsp;Thats always been one of my biggest pet peeves with Filipino restaurants/cuisine (the food tastes good, but theres no effort in presentation like at Thai or Vietnamese restaurants).  &nbsp;  The moment I bit into my food it was like the best first bite Ive had in a long-ass time.&nbsp; I seriously had an orgasmic experience, tears couldve fallen down my cheeks.&nbsp; My food looked better than the picture on the menu.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If anyone wants to go get breakfast (served all day) at Kenkoys in Pacifica with me, just let me know and Im totally there.&nbsp; And it doesnt hurt that Anton, the owners son who works the counter most of the time, is hella fine!&nbsp; He can be mybabydaddy, and I dont usually like Filipino guys unless theyre exceptional!  &nbsp;  I need to try their  halo-halo ,   turon ,  sinigang  and  lechon  (cant be Filipino and not eat pork!) before I wholeheartedly give them the title of Audreys Favorite Filipino Restaurant.&nbsp; But I already know their breakfasts are good, as are their  caldereta  (not cooked with goat, but beef) and  kare-kare  dishes.  &nbsp;Okay, Im done raving.&nbsp; Wah!

"       Bittersweet   NOTE: I was trying to upload this entry yesterday, but my computer was acting all screwy and it instead got saved to my Blog drafts.   My bad.  Second entry in one day, but  Just so much going on.  Must comment.  I went into work this morning to tie up some loose ends since tomorrow is technically my last day.  Id actually say today was my last day, but Im going into the office (turn in my keys and pack up my desk) and Im also getting paid for the day.  I made the decision this morning to just be a full-time student this semester.  Im taking five classes (14 units), and I havent been in school for about a year. I really need to ease into the academic environment again and not have any time-consuming outside distractions (except for Hyphen and small freelance projects on the side [Ive got some things planned, just you wait and see]).  I asked my dad for his input, because hes in charge of a trust he and my mom set up before she died.  My brother and I are getting a small (I stress small) amount of money automatically deposited into our bank accounts monthly.  Our inheritance isnt crazy, so dont think Im some rich/spoiled wannabe  haciendera  because I can afford to do/buy things I couldnt before, and I inherited my moms jewelry and land in the Philippines.  Her jewelry/things and land are things I hold onto for sentimental valuebecause they are whats left of her and I have a right to them.  But as far as actual money, I am  kuripot /frugal (stingy) where it counts (and generous, I hope!) and I am researching avenues of investing.   Lets just say that because of all this, I finally have the opportunity to be a full-time studentto finish the coursework left for me to get my undergraduate degree.  Daddy said I should just be a full-time student not only for this semester but until I finish.  I have three more semesters left (including this fall).  Im all for playing the part of full-time student fall semester, but Im not so sure about spring and next fall.  I could get antsy about not having something to balance out Hyphen and studying.  I like working, only because Ive found what I like to do and what Im good at.  But I feel like I made a really HUGE decision today.  I think I deserve it.  I made a lot of sacrifices when Mama got sick; I put off school every time my parents needed me to be at home.  At the time I resented it, but in retrospect I wouldnt trade that time for anything else in the world.  When we found out Mama only had months left back in March, she made me promise to get my undergrad degreeto stop putting it off after she passed away.  Out of every promise I ever made to her, this is the most important.  I dont feel any regret, nor do I feel behind anymore.  I used to get down on myself about hitting my mid-20s and not being done with college yet.  I almost gave up on the thought that I could ever go to grad school.  I even used to resent Mama for being sick, because of all the wasted time I took off to take care of her.  But now that shes gone, I realize how young and lucky I am.  The only bittersweet thing is that Mama wont be there on my graduation day.  (Typing that just made me want to cry.  Wow.)  Anyhow, gotta go.  Gotta reserve a rental car for Saturday, then head to Oakland to pick up the keys to my new home from Mel.  Then were going out for dinner.  Yay!     "
"       Stef Says I Talk Funny  Watching:  CB4  on Comedy Central&nbsp; (This film is almost as funny as  Fear of a Black Hat   Last nights screening of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle  was crazy.&nbsp; I was in line with Yvette, Adrienne and Ades friend John.&nbsp; As it was, I didnt think wed make it in, much less Mel and Hatty (who were still outside).&nbsp; Vette, Ade, John and I sat in the 3rd row (center), so I was surprised that Mel and Hatty got in and sat in front of us.&nbsp; Mel pulled rank and was like, Im the editor of Hyphen and were one of the sponsors!&nbsp; (Insert evil laugh here.)&nbsp; Im too afraid to pull rank and drop names to get my wayunless its at my own event and I have to put someone in their place.&nbsp; (I always get people who dont realize who I am, claiming to be important and on the guest list.&nbsp; My philosophy is, If you really were important, youd already be on the guest list.)  Back to the film.&nbsp; Just as I came out of  Coffee & Cigarettes  wanting a  yosi /smoke really bad, I had a craving for White Castle.&nbsp; If youre wondering what I thought, the film wasnt that bad.&nbsp; It was better than I expected and it was funny (low brow humor).  I saw Scott.&nbsp; At the screening I saw/ran into a lot of people I know through community (the Asian American media/arts community).&nbsp; I waved Scott over to where I was sitting and we chatted.&nbsp; Initially I was in Hyphen mode, wanting to get the ball rolling on this arrangement Hyphen made with APAture/Kearny Street Workshop (the organization Scott works for), but Scott sidetracked and brought up my mom.&nbsp; I think he heard from Truong (my friend, his boss) about my mom passing away.  Scott had a hard time looking me in the eye and I think it was because he felt uncomfortable talking about death.&nbsp; But I realized that I wasnt uncomfortable anymore.&nbsp; Now that its been two and a half months since Mama died, its easier for me to talk about it and to hear other people tell me theyre sorry.&nbsp; In the first month after Mama passed away, I just wanted everyone in the world to know how heartbroken I washow much her death changed (and would change) my life (and my dads and brothers lives).&nbsp; I wanted to yell and throw shit in an angry fiteven punch walls and people.  And I am sorry to say that I went through a couple of weeks where I was angry and hurt by certain friends, if they hadnt told me they felt sorry for me or offered shoulders to cry on.&nbsp; But I understand that everyone who knows me and knows about the 4+ years I dealt with my mom having cancer, and now her deaththey all empathize with me regardless of if theyve been vocal about it.&nbsp; Its that whole more than words clich.&nbsp; Sometimes people dont know what to say, so they dont say anything at all.&nbsp; I cant say that silence is golden in this case, but I understand.   Anyhow.&nbsp; I totally forgot that my friend Stef was in Boston.&nbsp; I brought a gift for her to the screening, thinking shed be there.&nbsp; I ran into her boyfriend Paul and pawned her gift onto him since I was tired of holding it.&nbsp; I hope Stef gets the present okay, because after the screening I didnt see Paul holding the box anymorethats an expensive gift.&nbsp; (I saw this fanny pack thing at Sunhee Moon and I wanted to buy it for Stef, but I didnt imagine itd be real leather and cost $91.) &nbsp;But Stef is definitely worth it; if you met her youd think so, too.  Moving on.&nbsp; Do I talk funny?&nbsp; As in, do I have an accent?&nbsp; Ive been told that Californians have an international sort of accentthat because Cali is so multi-cultural, there really isnt any noticeable native accent (except of course the Valley Girl/Surfer Dude).&nbsp; I once dated a Canadian who told me I had an accent when I said certain things; I thought he was trippin because he said aboot.&nbsp; Saturday night Stef pointed out to me that sometimes I pronounce my flat As with an A thats inbetween the A in cat and the A in spa.&nbsp;   I told her its probably just because I grew up all over (Navy brat), so how I speak is a mix of all the places Ive lived (accents Ive heard).&nbsp;  Or , it could be my residual FOBby Filipino-ness.&nbsp; Sometimes I FOB out (say things in broken English or with a slight Filipino accent), especially after Ive spent a lot of time with my family.&nbsp; Plus, I make an effort to articulate Spanish and Tagalog (and any other ethnic) words with the correct pronunciation.&nbsp; I dont like to Americanize (mutilate) ethnic words, as much as possible.  &nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Gotta meet Yuki and Neda for lunch.&nbsp; Im hopping on BARTI am getting reacquainted with BART since Ill be a commuter (bridge &amp; tunnel) once I move to Oakland.

"       Take That, Rewind It Back  Wow.&nbsp; I was given notice yesterday that I am being laid off at my nonprofit admin job.&nbsp; Budget cuts--the money that's allocated to pay me is instead going to hire/pay someone with more tech experience.&nbsp; (I was a 'membership services assistant' who processed memberships and did data entry.&nbsp; Our servers were always crashing and I ain't no techie, so...you do the math.)&nbsp; And then my 'contract' with the PR firm is up in a few weeks.  I'm back to being unemployed.&nbsp; But then again, that's okay.&nbsp; I just paid for my classes for fall semester and I'm taking a full load--14 units (5 classes).&nbsp; It's been a long-ass time since I was in a position where I had the time/could afford to take a full load of classes.&nbsp; For the first time I'm not hurting for money, either.&nbsp; I'm debating on whether or not I should look for part-time work, or just be a full-time student fall semester--classes start in about 3 weeks.  Anyhow.  Hyphen is a sponsor for tonights sneak preview of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle .&nbsp; I will be&nbsp;at the Metreon&nbsp;to represent with&nbsp;other Hyphenators and my friend Yvette. &nbsp;Surprisingly, Ebert and whoever-that-skinny-guy-is gave the film 'two thumbs up.'&nbsp; I am not sure what to think of&nbsp;Hyphen sponsoring an Asian American version of  Dude, Wheres My Car? .&nbsp; I mean, it stars the MILF guy (John Cho from  American Pie )&nbsp; And then I read an article about  She Hate Me , the upcoming Spike Lee film.&nbsp; I cant wait to see it (along with  Garden State ).&nbsp; My most favorite film of all time, is  Crooklyn .&nbsp; Oh, and I saw  Napoleon Dynamite  last week!&nbsp; You have to see it!  This morning I woke up with Bob Marleys Could You Be Loved in my head.&nbsp; I cannot remember the dream, but I remember that song was in my dream.&nbsp; Its a refreshing change, considering that my mind has been bombarded with Usher and radio music I dont especially like.&nbsp; (Take that, rewind it back/Urshur got the voice to make the booty go)&nbsp; Yesterday I had Juvenile (Ungh!&nbsp; I like it like thatslow motion for me) in my head.&nbsp; Last week I had Its Raining Men and Toxic (by Britney Spears) in my head.&nbsp; I was told that one surefire way to get annoying songs out of your head, is to start singing Viva Las Vegas.  After leaving the admissions office at school, I went to the mall to buy some more makeup.&nbsp; I've been a Makeup Whore since Mama passed away--just buying and buying.&nbsp; It seems the older I get, the more makeup I feel I need to use to cover up the signs of aging.&nbsp; I know Im only 25, but since I was about 20 Ive felt so much older than my friends who are around my age solely because of the experiences Ive had and the things Ive had to do for myself.&nbsp; In my early 20s I went through a period where I would get four hours of sleep a night, work, take late afternoon/night/weekend classes, and/or work a second job/internship, and party it up just as hard.&nbsp; I cant do that anymorethe age and fatigue show on my face.&nbsp; Hence, more makeup.&nbsp; Now I have to wear under eye concealer and use anti-wrinkle cream.&nbsp; The beauty regimen gets more complicated with age.&nbsp; I remember when I was in my teens, I thought 25 was old.&nbsp; Now that Im 25 and getting closer to 30/40, 30/40 seem pretty damn young.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; When I was speaking to Donna (my assistant for Hyphen) after the general meeting last week, she interrupted me while I was in the middle of saying something.&nbsp; She was like, Oh my God, Im just so mesmerized by your eyes.&nbsp; I played it off and got all diva, like, Oh, thank you! and batted my eyelashes.&nbsp; I sort of felt validated because that same afternoon I went to Sephora to buy this eye shadow base and I re-did my makeup before the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; I felt like the $18 I spent was well worth the money.&nbsp;   If you only knew how much money Ive spent at Sephora and MAC since May, youd bug out.&nbsp; Those joints are like candy stores to me.&nbsp; And I just love having the girls who work the counter, apply makeup on me--eye shadow is the only way you'll get my ass to wear pink.  Now I'm going to go walk around and feel cute because I'm all did up, wearing my new corduroy blazer, low-cut top&nbsp;and tight-ass black pants.&nbsp; HOLLA!     "
"        Vegans Arent Balut-iful  Didnt get a chance to meet Mel and her family for dinner last night.&nbsp; I got stuck at the Laundromat waiting for my clothes because the first dryer I used was broken and I had to wait for one that worked.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; I felt bad because I know Mel wanted someone to save her from her parents and keep her company.  Anyway.&nbsp; When Mels friend Sorcha was in town, the three of us shared a vegan banana nut muffin.&nbsp; We each had a small taste and then it got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; The other day, I was curious and tried vegan macaroni & cheese.&nbsp; It, too, got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; I guess its safe to say that vegan = tasteless.  My freshman year of college, I was a vegetarian.&nbsp; I went home one time and my mom fed me  pancit  (stir fried noodles) with chicken (saying, Just a little bit wont hurt).&nbsp; From that moment on I was a rehabilitated carnivore.&nbsp; I will never again give up meat.  I like to eat my pho with rare beef, tripe, and tendons.&nbsp; Thats the only way to do it.&nbsp; I dont mind organ meat.&nbsp; You cant be Asian and not eat pork or some kind of organ meat.&nbsp; Asians do not waste any part of the animal.  I like to eat  papaitan  (a stew made with bile and tripe) and  kare-kare  (oxtail, tripe and veggies, stewed in a peanut sauce).&nbsp; One of my best friends, Yvette, is half  Kapampangan  (her dad is from  Pampanga  province).&nbsp;  Kapampangans  are known for their  longanisa  (sweet pork sausage) and discriminating appetites.&nbsp; Yvette picks on me like, Youre half  Ilocana , thats why you eat some nasty shit.&nbsp; But Yvette likes  lengua  (tongue), and I refuse to eat anything that can taste me back.&nbsp; So were even.&nbsp; ( Day, magkapareho din tayo, di ba? )  Growing up, I was disgusted by how my mom and dad would eat shrimp.&nbsp; Theyd pluck the head off first, and suck the brains out, claiming, Its de best part!&nbsp; My dad would suck the eyeballs of fish.&nbsp; He eats fish heads fast and clean like a pro.&nbsp; Nowadays when I visit my Auntie Baby and we eat shrimp  kamayan  style (with your hands, like a peasant), I suck on shrimp heads too.&nbsp; I wouldnt say its the best part, but its definitely where the flavor is.&nbsp;   I also used to be really horrified at the thought of eating  balut .&nbsp;  Balut  is a fertilized duck egg that is 17-19 days old.&nbsp; Its supposed to be an aphrodesiac (makes men strong/virile), and is generally eaten as  pulutan  (a snack) with beer.&nbsp; In May my Auntie Thelma flew out from Australia to help Daddy and I take care of Mama until she passed away.&nbsp; We stayed up into the night, taking shifts.&nbsp; Since Daddy and I didnt sleep much, Auntie Thelma had me buy  balut .&nbsp; Id always wanted to try it, but was too chicken shit (no pun intended) to try, so Auntie Thelma finally taught me how.   Balut s not that bad.&nbsp; The key is to not scrutinize what youre eating (so eat as fast as you can).&nbsp; And to use salt.&nbsp; Basically you boil the duck egg, crack the pointy top just a little, and sip out the  sisiw  (fluid).&nbsp; Then you peel off/down the shell as you eat.&nbsp; If youre lucky enough to get  balut  thats 17 days old, then theres no biting into barely formed beaks, feathers and feet.&nbsp; It really tastes like chickenjust slightly funkier. &nbsp;I believe I am a true Filipino now, now that Ive tried  balut .&nbsp; Back in the day, Taek would say hes more Filipino than me because hed eaten  balut  and I hadnt.&nbsp; Hed say hes more  balut -iful than me. &nbsp;(Not anymore Korean Boy!)

"       Cigarettes, Lubrication & Scandal  Saw Chris Fan last night.&nbsp; It was good to see him.&nbsp;   At the party, all of us Hyphen folk were being clique-y and not socializing outside of our circle.&nbsp; Ade, Mel, Stef, Hatty, and I were kicking it on the deck out back the whole night, talking to Albert, Alex, Jason and Paul (guys involved with Hyphen, the guys who came with us).&nbsp;   I got pretty tipsy (after a Jell-o shot and rum & coke).&nbsp; One point in the night I told Adrienne and Hatty, Watch this.&nbsp; I wanted to show off.&nbsp; Drink in hand, I sauntered up to Jason, tugged on his shirt and yelled, GIMME CIGARETTE!&nbsp; (It was the second time Id done that to him that night.)&nbsp; He was like, Damn, here you go!&nbsp; What are you?&nbsp; Korean or something?&nbsp; That got Hatty riled up, What are you trying to say about Koreans?&nbsp; But I was just trying to prove a pointJason takes my shit, even though Im a foot shorter than him and he can stomp on me.&nbsp; Were like the Odd Couple.&nbsp; And I like to be loud/obnoxious sometimes when Im drunk, because I can play it off and still be cute.  I am so excited.&nbsp; Im making a trip to Australia and the Philippines (possibly Thailand and Malaysia) next summer.&nbsp; It looks like Hattys going to be my traveling companion!!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Well have so much fun!&nbsp; Im trying to convince Adrienne to go.&nbsp; I want Mel to come with, if she has some vacation time to spare.&nbsp; Yay some more!  Mr. Todd Inoue is serious about his karaoke.&nbsp; This (and the fact that Todd carries around this really cool Japan Airlines bag) makes Todd my new superhero over O-Dub.&nbsp; (Todd, this is where we make rice eating gestures and dance  kulintang , haha.&nbsp; I loved your article on Chad Hugo--especially that picture of you with the 'Hey Chad, I'm Filipino too!' sign.)&nbsp;   Mel and I want to organize Karaoke Night for Hyphen staff.&nbsp; My friend Brent used to be involved as a consultant, but now hes more active.&nbsp; I remember him asking me, So, who are all the cool kids?&nbsp; Who do you hang out with on staff?&nbsp; Thats when I realized that new staff and interns probably think some of us are clique-y (which we are)which means we need STAFF BONDING.&nbsp; What better way than drunken karaoke?&nbsp; (Plus, Mel, Mia, Stef, and I just want to saaang.)&nbsp; This also reminds me that its time we had a staff retreat, too.&nbsp;   I finally watched The Surreal Life on VH1.&nbsp; Friday night I watched all episodes as I packed up 80% of my belongings in preparation for my move to Oakland.&nbsp; Ron Jeremy, bighairypornstar, has a pet turtle.&nbsp; Thats all I have to say about him.&nbsp; Trishelle, from Real World Las Vegas?&nbsp; I cant stand to watch herit makes me want to get violent (dropkick her in her neck, smack her upside her head, pull her hair out, etc.).&nbsp; Its so funny how I can feel so strongly about someone, based on how they show portrays them.&nbsp;   OMG!   My landlord finally found someone to occupy my room when I move.&nbsp; In the midst of packing up my bathroom I realized that, when he was showing my room to prospective tenants, if anyone happened to look at my bottom shelf of toiletries and beauty products, they wouldve seen this trial size bottle of Astroglide I got from Good Vibrations.&nbsp; (Laughing my ass off.)&nbsp;  SCANDALOUS!   On to something more mundane&nbsp; Can I just say how much I love  tsinilas /flip-flops?&nbsp; I already have that summer flip-flop tan on my feet and I love it.  Okay, gotta go to Home Depot then rush back home and shower because I'm meeting Melissa and her family (her parents and little brother are in town from Houston) for dinner.&nbsp; Melissa's not my girlfriend or boyfriend, but meeting a friend's/soon-to-be roommate's parents is a big deal.&nbsp; Eek.

"        Superfreaky, YOW!      I was stuck in traffic on the 580, on my way back home from Fry's in Fremont--I heard on the radio that Rick James was found dead at his home this morning.  Died in his sleep of natural causes.  As soon as I got home I got online to read about it on the news.      I wonder what Dave Chappelle has to say about it...bitch.      Anyway, I have a USB cable to finally hook my printer up to my computer and dinner to cook. (I'm making  tinolang manok  [chicken with chayote and spinach] and rice.  Yum.)  Hope you all have great weekends.  Mel's speaking at a NAAAP conference tomorrow and I'm tagging along, then Sunday I'm having Stef (and Paul), Adrienne (and Jon), Hatty and Yvette over for dinner.  I haven't cooked for anyone since May.      "
"       Audrey In Animation   urlLink     Sorry. Lolo/Grandpa Monchichi was just a test. Blogger's all confusing with how you put up pics and whatnot--you have to download this messaging-like publisher called Hello to do it for you (which I think sort of sucks).  Anyhow.  Remember that site I mentioned that lets you make a Buddy Icon of yourself? (Go here: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml)   All Hyphen staff made icons of themselves and you can see them on the masthead of issue 4 (but mine's not there--I was in Bakersfield at the time).  But I wanted to try one out anyhow; we're suposed to have our icons replace our staff pics on the Hyphen bio page online.  I didn't think my original .gif looked like me (the hair was parted to the wrong side and too short), so I tried again. Now I'm more satisfied. It's Audrey in animation! Cute, huh?  Now go make  Buddy Icons of yourselves!    urlLink        "

"        An Elephant Never Forgets  Listening to:  Midnight Marauders  - A Tribe Called Quest  I finally washed FIVE freaking loads of laundry yesterday afternoon.       I was at the laundromat reading my trashy magazine (Allure) with Natalie Portman on the cover and turned around to look at the clock on the wall. I glimpsed a familiar face--I thought it was this girl I was really good friends with in high school, Michelle. I couldn't forget her--she was a tiny Korean girl who was an inch or two shorter than me, had a cute round face and brown hair, and the sweetest little voice. I dunno, I figured I was imagining things and I went back to my magazine. But then I had to walk out to my car to get bleach and fabric softener and I noticed the car parked next to mine was the same exact Toyota Corolla that Michelle and her sister used to drive in high school. The license plate frame said 'Bill Wright Toyota' and 'Bakersfield.' I knew it was her.  So what did I do?  Shit.  I fought the urge to go up to her and awkwardly ask her if she might recognize me, then tell her who I am, and ask her how she's doing, etc. Realizing that I was too lame to do that, made me hide behind my trashy magazine even more. What's really funny is that the last time I was living in Oakland I thought I walked past her on Grand Avenue, but it happened so fast, I wouldn't have been able to run after her and have that awkward moment, even if I'd wanted to. Now I realize that probably  was  her who walked past me.  Now you may ask why I didn't do anything at the laundromat... Well, I've had the experience once before that I ran into someone I went to high school with, someone who hung out in my circle of friends but I just lost touch with. Well, I re-introduced myself to that person and they totally blanked on me. It's not that I looked different, but they didn't even remember my name. Like I disappeared from all the past experiences we had together--erased. And suffice it to say that my ego was actually crushed--I actually thought, 'How can you not remember  ME ?  I'm AUDREY, DAMMIT! ' (For real, though. I know there are a ton of Filipino Audreys out there, but there are only a handful of Ednalinos in this world. And there's only one  ME .)  But yeah, back to my story. I didn't want to have to be disappointed that someone I was as close to as a sister when I was a junior and senior in high school might not remember me.  Sigh .  It only makes me wonder...those of you reading this, those of you who know me... Will I always be remembered? Is it any consolation knowing that  I  won't forget even if  you  do?  On a totally different note...  I am still getting those annoying before 8 AM calls from that 'unavailable' number. In fact, that shit woke me up yesterday morning.  Blah.       "
"        Love Those Hons!      I feel bad. One of my friends who I work on Hyphen with was talking to me on AIM, wanting to discuss Hyphen internal biz stuff and I wasn't in the mood to chat about it. I freaking live in the Hyphen Apartment with Melissa--the issue 1 cover is up as artwork on our living room wall, we have a huge hall closet dedicated to housing Hyphen shit... The two of us try not to talk about it casually, so we don't burn ourselves out.      I just walked back and forth between the kitchen and my room/desk so I wouldn't get caught up. I also didn't want to be rude and be all, 'You know what? Can we not talk about Hyphen right now?'    Anyhow.      I wish I'd taken a 'before' picture of my room to show you how fucking chaotic it looked with random shit strewn all over the floor, boxes, styrofoam and bags of clothes. Today my room pretty much looks like I envisioned it to look. I'm not done, but no more piles of junk on the floor. Everything's put away except for the last of my clothes and papers that need filing.      It was sort of hard sifting through certain boxes. I got caught up looking through old photo albums that I took from Bakersfield, with the intention of buying new albums and re-arranging the photos. Lots of photos of Mama and it made me a little sad to look at them and miss her. I also found a few articles of clothing I 'stole' from her closet before Daddy and I donated all her belongings to Good Will. I picked out some photos to put on my nifty magnetic bulletin board strip--most of them pics of my parents.   Some days I'm fine, and some days I feel really empty and heartbroken, missing my mom.     Trevor called me the other day and he was like, 'I know how it is. It comes and goes, but it's always there.' His father died when he was still a teenager (I think). Trevor met Mama last summer, too.     Sigh.      Last night I took a break from the process of unpacking and went to Berkeley to hang out with three of the Hon siblings (my friends Tim, Rachel and Phil) and Nam. We watched  Starsky & Hutch  at Tim's grandmother's apartment. She wanted to watch the movie with us and Tim and all them were trying to coax her into going to bed. They were like, 'It's a bad movie. It'll give you nightmares. Go to sleep--you want me to tuck you in?' They're grandmother's so cute--they imitate her accent the way I like to imitate my parents' and aunties'/uncles' accents. It was good to see Tim and all them--it was the first time for me to see Tim in over a year; the first time to see Rach in almost two years. I was surprised to see Phil all grown--I first met him when he was like 13/14, running around barefoot, and now he's probably 18 or 19 and taller than Tim!       I love the Hon Family--their house was like my Angel Island when I first moved up to the Bay Area from LA. Ah, memories.      "
"        Hello from my beautiful new Oakland home! :-)      You probably guessed that I finally set my new desk up and hooked up my computer. (Don't tell the guys who live upstairs, but Mel and I are piggybacking [stealing] their wireless Internet. Shhh! [That just means money I would've spent on Internet will now go to digital cable, ha!]) All I did was plug in my wireless USB adapter and  VOILA! , I'm online. WAH!       So here's an update to tide you over til I finish unpacking, etc...      Mel told me before I moved in that there's a youngster (undergrad at Berkeley) who lives above us (his room is above mine) who used to give her and her old roommate problems. He'd play bass and drums loud, play his music loud, have loud sex... He hasn't been a problem for a while, because Mel and Barbara (her old roomie) would go upstairs and knock on the door and complain. But Mel and I ran into him the other day on our way out (to Target for some shopping) and she was like, 'Oh, Brian, I want you to meet Audrey. She just moved in with me.' She said how she thinks we should all sit down and come up with some common courtesy rules about noise control. I agree. I'm going back to school (I have two weeks of freedom left!) and I'm not trying to be all gangster and walking my ass upstairs to curse that fucker out because I can't study.       But the loud sex thing? I'm not tripping off that. I've had roommates with skanky One Minute Man boyfriends--I've heard rhythm-less bed-banging. (Don't know what's worse, no rhythm or no stamina/endurance?) I think Brian-Who-Lives-Upstairs is a Ten Second Brother (but he sounds like he's got a little rhythm). I heard some bad-banging at like 2 AM this morning--I mentally timed it and it seriously didn't go on for too long. In my head I was like, 'BOO! I feel sorry for whoever's lying underneath you all unsatisfied right now! BOO SOME MORE! BOOOOOO!' The least he could've done was go for a second ten-second round, but he didn't.        Look at me, talking shit already about the neighbors.  But it's okay. The really good loud-sex noises will be coming from my room soon (haha).      Anyhow!      I moved in the first wave of my things on Friday afternoon/evening. Then Mel and I headed to Ikea to do some shopping for a TV/media stand. I actually wanted to furnish my room Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn style, just because I didn't want to get callouses from building my furniture (I really moved in with little in terms of furniture [just a desk chair, bookcase and a mattress]), but I shall have an Ikea room, too. My new furniture (dresser, bedframe, desk, chair) has cost me a little over $400. It's not so bad--I'm just not down with the raw wood look, so I need to stain/varnish my shit so it doesn't look so cheap (haha!).      Saturday I rented this crazy 'luxury' minivan (is there such a thing?) and drove solo to Bakersfield to fetch boxes out of my storage space. (It was a daylong mission. I drove down, got my shit, then drove back up. I left the Bay Area around noon and returned about 9 PM.) When Daddy and I packed up our house so Junior (my brother) could move in, I marked about 4 boxes with the letters 'SF' on them, so I could easily spot them when I went to retrieve them. Unfortunately Daddy and my uncles put some of those boxes in the far back of the storage space, behind big furniture that I'm too weak to move, so I only came back with 2 boxes (none of which had any kitchen stuff that I wanted/needed).  The trip wasn't bad at all. I rocked out to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake the whole way down (I made sure to bring CDs that made me want to either dance or sing along so I wouldn't fall asleep.) I ate In-N-Out at my half-way pit stop.  And I visited Mama's grave. Instead of flowers, this time I brought her a turtle. I was annoyed that I had to cut my visit/talk short, though. The sprinklers were on at the cemetery, so I got caught a couple times as it went around and around. I think my mom understands why I had to cut my visit short. Before I left, I told Mama about my move and how she would like both Mel and my new home.     Sunday afternoon Hatty, Mel, Adrienne and her friend (visiting from Australia) John, helped me move the very last wave of things from Pacifica to Oakland. The biggest pain in the ass was my mattress. I had no problem transporting that shit from SF to Pacifica (shorter distance, and I had more rope to work with), but this time around it was a nightmare. We dropped Hatty off at BART in Colma, retied my mattress, stopped off at In-N-Out in Daly City, stopped at Serramonte Mall and instead reshifted boxes to squeeze my mattress into Ade's minivan, then we were on our way.      Anyhow, let me go. I need to run errands. I need to mail Jeremy his present so maybe it will arrive in Philly in time for his bday, and (EEK!) rush Hatty on a flyer design so I can get Hyphen flyers made for the AAJA Unity Conference for Todd and Ursula in DC this whole week/end.      I need to get my shit in order for the Hyphen meeting Thursday. Ugh!      "

"       Every morning when I wake up I think, 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'  I hate getting up in the morning.  I am so not a morning person that I am the anti-morning person.  If you talk to me as I am waking, I will growl at you, even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me.  I crave Saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on.  But, somehow, and micraculously, after about 15-20 minutes on the weekdays, I begin to perk up, start making the coffee (thank God for coffee) and think that maybe I can make it through the day without vertically snoring.  I do end up making it through the day, but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon.  The hours between 4-6 have become my nemisis.  The problem revolves around the fact that I stay up 'til about 12:30 or 1 everynight (I teach school so this is way late).  There is no real reason why I do this.  I am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater.  No, you can usually catch me doing, well, nothing I guess.  I can't acurately say what I do each night.  Sometimes I'm reading, sometimes watching TV, sometimes reading blogs online, and sometimes talking to west coast friends.  I used to actually stay up to watch Letterman, but TV bores me more and more lately.    I have always been a night owl.  I can't remember when I didn't like staying up late.  It must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when I can remember watching Saturday Night Live and Johnny Carson with my family (I know, quality bonding time).  I remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and I was convinced this would improve my grades.  I still 'wake up' at about 8pm everynight.  This is when I begin getting things done, the dishes, the laundry, the phone calls, the emails, the projects, the organizing.  About 2 hours into my second wind, I remember that I wanted to go to bed early so I don't feel like shit in the morning, but 10pm rolls around and I think I can give it one more hour and then I think if I go to bed at midnight I'll still get about 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep.  Sounds good, but this never happens.  So, everynight I stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon.  I wish that I could say that I have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties, but no.  That's not me anyway.  Instead, I'll be washing my hair, helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book.  Tonight I will be, um, let's see, um, well, how about reading my fabulous travel book on London (no, I'm not going anytime soon, I'm just obsessed) until midnight.  And tomorrow morning when I wake up I will think 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'         "
"       Who, pray tell, designed apartment buildings so that you can hear everything that is happening in the apartment below you with almost complete and utter accuracy?  I mean, is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build?  Think, architects, think!    My neighbors downstairs are college students.  Why they live in our beautiful, mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals, far away from the college they attend apartment complex, I don't know.  And, I actually, don't know them.  I know that one is a boy and one is a girl.  I know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along, mostly Dave Matthews songs.  I know the girl will occasionally put on some Jason Mraz.  (My connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds, but I will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know.)  And, I know that I can hear the boy cough at times.  What does that mean he can hear me do?  I wonder about this one.  Tonight, they are listening to the radio and they have what I think is a subwoofer cranked up so as I sit here trying to watch TV or listen to my music, I just hear deep voices and bass.  It BLOWS!!!!!!!!!  So, being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor, I turned up my subwoofer to the MAXIMUM.  Take that you slackers!  I am usually quite kind with my subwoofer.  When my brother installed it and put it at Maximum, I told him I had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower, a lot lower.  So much for thinking of other people.   The reason for this retaliation is that I think that they like to bang their ceiling, my floor, when they think that I am being loud.  I am not loud.  OK, so I always have some kind of noise on, I hate quiet, but when I am watching TV and they bang, and I check the volume, it is on 2 bars.  'OK people, I pay enough in rent to listen to my TV at 2 FUCKING BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'  I am not actually sure what the banging is about.  I wonder sometimes if it is my imagination.  What could 2-3 pounding-like sounds in rapid succession be?  One day I came home and as I walked in the door I heard the 2 bangs.  I threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor 'I haven't even been here to make noise.  What, you don't like it when I open my door?'    Maybe, just maybe, there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while I am constantly monitoring my volume.  I can't help but remember the Friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise.  When he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them, but they are all in his apartment. Could this be what is happening in my building? I don't know, but I always turn down the noise if I hear the banging until, of course, tonight and the subwoofer wars.  Game on!           "
"       Richmond's annual chili cook-off held many feasts for my eyes:  1) William Hung.  I know, you're jealous.  He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of 'She Bangs' was almost worth the $20 admission fee.  2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps.  I know, you're jealous again.  Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements.  3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended.  We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on.  Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks.  4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door.  There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door.  Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing.  Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um.  When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says 'I'm sorry, I just really had to pee,' say 'It's OK, do what you gotta do' and quickly get in your car and pull away.  Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad.            "
"       When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought 'Oh hell, here's another one.'  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.'  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.'  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.          "
"       I love NPR.  Music stations can make you feel like you are stuck on repeat of a mixed CD.  The same songs over and over.  People, please.  But then, there in the distance, on the hour, every hour, and during rush hour and some good hours on Friday night and Sunday, there is NPR to rescue me.  I like a pop song just as much as the next person, but I don't think that I ever actually will 'find [you] in a club with a bottle full of bub,' but I do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies.  (I heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day.)  I love the idea of multitasking, driving and getting abreast of what is, or is not, going on in the world.  I can't watch news on TV anymore, unless it's BBC and then only when I'm actually in England, because the inane (trying to be) analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these people's mouths is too much for me to stand.  I tell my father everytime that I am home that FoxNews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience (if you didn't know, that's suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing, 8th grade, yeah I know).  He just ignores me and continues to be 'dumbed down.'  Newspapers are fine, but I don't have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesn't seem right to me.  And so, when I get in my car and I'm just sick of hearing the same 4 songs, I check the clock and thank God that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as I drive  home.  Some days, I even leave early in the morning so that I can hear the more in-depth news as I drive in (the closer you get to 9am the more 'entertaining' the pieces get).  I mean, all things considered I just need a little fresh air to handle this American life.           "
"       Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?'  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.'  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.'  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class.          "
"       When riding my bike and a slight hill appears I must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline (I'm not talking real hills).  As I'm peddaling with more and more emphasis I can't help but be aware of my powerhouse legs.  My calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight.  There are two reasons for my treetrunk legs.  First, there is genetics (I know, blame your mother).  But seriously, I've never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat, sure there is the occasional walking of the dog, but no intense exercise going on, and yet these women do not have dainty legs.  We have legs built for... well I don't know what for.  The second reason is Linda Watkins School of Dance.  I was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs, how else could they leap like that?  I tapped, balleted, toed, and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes, plies, and time steps.  I usually hated dance class, but the recitals I lived for.  There is nothing like being on stage and performing.  My favorite was the kick line.  And still, years later, when I hear Elvis Costellos' 'Hot Hot Hot' (which is not that often) I want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split, oh there were splits.  Sadly, I couldn't do a split now if you paid me.  I miss the way a dancer knows her body, how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated, even walking can be a dance.  Our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancer's grace.  The story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand.  When she stepped up her back stairs to her house, she slipped on a thin layer of ice.  And this is where the grace comes in- she would emphasize that because she was dancer, she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground, legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow.  The strange thing is that I don't remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class, but I understood what she was saying.  A dancer's right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing.  I've never broken a bone, pulled a muscle, or torn a ligament, could this be due to the dancing?  I don't know but, thanks to Linda Watkins, when I'm 85 and fall down my front stairs, I may not in fact break my hip.                   "
"       I was cruising on my bike through Windsor Farms today.  It's a posh neighborhood in Richmond's westend where the houses are big and beautiful, the yards are kept up by hired hands I'm sure, and all children go to St. Catherine's, or St. Christopher's (cause being educated along ghettofied kids is to much of a reality for these folks).  OK, so I would like to own a house here, but my kids would go to public school, damnit.  On my bike tour past the beautiful AgeCroft (yes, some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from England, but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves).  The house is amazing and has a prescious spot in Richmond, it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments.  It's serene, and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home, C-ville.  Growing up among moutains, I hated them.  My hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below.  And, in many ways they did, my hometown is a sheltered place.  Though quaint at times, it could possibly be the redneck version of 'A City Upon (surrounded by) A Hill (hills).'  But, we all know what happens to Utopia, oh yeah, it doesn't exist.  So, for most of my life I have cursed the moutains and hills, especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift (I actaully gave up trying for a good year).  I didn't start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in Montana.  I traveled to Montana for a friends wedding and when I stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains I thought I was back in my hometown except there are no semi-tall buildings and I don't think they know what urban sprawl is.  Throughout the weekend I kept thinking, 'What is so great about these moutains?'  OK, so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than Virginia's and they are bit more pristine, but really, no Virginian would be that amazed as I wasn't.  Then when drving back to C-ville from the airport in DC and going up and down the rolling hills, I thought 'These are my hills, Montana has nothing on these.'  I think I began to love my state then.  I'm proud to be a Virginian which is saying something, considering I have always wished to be an North Carolinian.  Richmond has no hills or mountains to look at, we're too far east.  I actually miss them.  Some days as I'm driving to work I feel like I don't have everything that I need for the day, I check everything, my watch, my purse, my coffee and I and can't find the missing piece, but maybe it's the moutains, the Blue Ridge, that I'm missing, without really knowing it.

"       My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house.  The pillow said, in green thread, 'Bloom Where You're Planted' and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words.  The first time I saw this pillow, I thought 'What a great saying.'  After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight.  The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted.  The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days.  I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time.  Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy.  The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning.  I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere.  Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen.  And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate.  And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form.   Next Time  Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein.  ~Naomi  Shihab Nye           "
"       I love the bridges of Richmond.  They are no architectural triumphs by any means.  They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying.    My favorite is the Nickel bridge.  It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work.  It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think.  As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other.    The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me.  On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation.  The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top.  Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous.  Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance.  Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge.  On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks.  The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond.  When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level.  The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil.   The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St.  It extends into the posh westend of Richmond.  This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping.  But, it's length is what is so fascinating.  It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all.  When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees.  Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest.  As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river.  It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected.  The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description.  The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights.    The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite.  It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the 'projects,' a sad and large part of this troubled town.  This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing.  Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath.  The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James.  The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia.  It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall.  I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do.  Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge.  The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above.  It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge.                   "
"       My name is Anna and I reside in the old town of Richmond, VA.  I'm a Virginian by birth, but this my first time living in the capitol city.  I'm a teacher for children with special needs in public schools.  I used to teach children with Autism which was fascinating.  For a long time, Autism was my passion.  At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again.  I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me.  It's a complicated, long story.  I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me.  I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it.  What does it mean to love a job?  What does it mean to love anything?  I just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings.  Things about me:  when 'Sex and the City' ended I felt like my best friends moved away.  I love my nieces and nephew.  I love to read pop fiction (yes, Bridget Jones is a friend of mine).  I have TiVo.  I used to write poetry (fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names).  I have a very well decorated apartment, it's beautiful if I do say so myself.  I love to cook and don't do it enough.  I need to learn to exercise frequently.  I wish that I could: take amazing photographs, publish some poems/ book/ picture/ dna, travel to any city anytime, live in NYC, live in London, etc.               "
"       Do you remember watching music videos?  I mean really watching them, like for hours.  My brother and I, along with some neighborhood kids at times, would sneak snippets of MTV.  We were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it, our parents not as quick as they were prudish.    I was enamored with George Michael.  Funny, he never seemed gay to me at age 10, but then again I didn't know what gay was then either.  He was the perfection of hotness to me and that song, Careless Whisper, where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble, whew that stubble.   These days, he's not so hot and I wonder why I never saw the obvious 'batting for the other team' going on, but again, this was the 80s, I don’t think he was letting many people in on his secrets, lest he lose album sales.  A few months ago I was flipping through the channels and found FUSE, a music video channel here in Richmond where all they do is play videos.  I was stunned.  Some flashy hip-hop song was on and I paused, filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video.  I felt like I was 12 again, the volume turned down, the den door closed, and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in.   I haven't watched another video since that FUSE moment months ago.  I miss the old videos where the stories were weak, if anything, the bands were overly made up, and the women had clothes on.  The current generation has no idea what endless, mindless hours of music videos are like.  They think MTV was created to expose the unreality of 18-23 lives.  The teeny boppers today won't have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear.  They're lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab TRL.    And, what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists?  The one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos.  Remember Divo and the whips?  My brother's band made a video a few years ago.  And if you blinked you missed it.  It did nothing for them because kids don't watch videos anymore, they want the (non) reality shows or the watered down, over-produced, uncreative pop star in their mist, and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day.  Or at least, this is what MTV thinks they want.  MTV has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking.  And VH1, don't even let me go there.  And it's sad to realize that I am no longer the target audience of MTV.  They don't care about my demographic anymore, even though I busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood.  Sorry Dire Straits, you can have your money for nothin'.  It turns out I don't want my MTV.          "
"       I was playing with my 3 year-old niece today when she said 'I'm the king of the castle.'  Then pointed to me and said, 'You're the dirty rascal.'  And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH.  I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song.   Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air.  I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck.  Whew!  How long has it been since I've seen on one of those.  Oh, the days of yore.  *sigh*         "
"       People, really.  You can leave comments.  I don't bite and I like to hear from the people I love in my life.  Really, I'd like to hear from you.  Seriously.  If you stop by, tell me so.   Love ya,          "
"       I'm funny.  Ask my friends; they'll tell you I'm funny.  It's my thing, my party trick.  I come from a long line of funny people.  No, none of them are famous.  We're funny the way your family is funny.  The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air.  My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science.  It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast you’re not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do.  And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other.    Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for 'happy hour' I was anything but happy.  Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me.  I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain.  I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done.  There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much.      My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground.  There were some hits, but mostly misses.  When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really.  But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references.  There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head.  I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed.  It was Raphael.  I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist.  A co-worker said, 'Is it a religious thing?'  'Um,' I thought, 'I give up.'   Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class.  I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU.  He didn’t bowl over with laughter.  'What’s wrong with you?' I thought and then realized I don't really know these people.    Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate.  My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month.  They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss.  She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley.  Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right.  I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation.           "
"       I went to Carytown today with my brother's little family.  My 6 year-old nephew's artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there, part of a city-wide school art project.  He was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see.  It was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow.  There was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom.  One blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside.  To the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an American flag in it, just hanging out.   I asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged.  His grandmother said it was a house and then I asked 'Well, is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house?'  He said he just thought it up.  'All right, well, good picture little boy.'    I then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artiste's mom states that the two buildings are 'Our house and Annie’s apartment building.'  I turned my body and swung my head around, 'What, my apartment building?'  To which the little one said 'Yeah' in his sweet, Well-what-else-could-it-be-? voice.  I looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors.  It was clearly a small one-story house sitting beside a 3-story brick apartment building.  How did I not see it before?  I said, 'Well, look at that, I'm famous.'  And then the love swept over me.  When a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture, that is love, real love.  Thank you my little A----baby.  I love you too.         "
"       I believe that dog-earing pages in a book is sac-religious.  I think I may have engaged in this practice when I was 12 for a day or two, but it never stuck.  It seemed too finite a thing to do.  Reading a book is a fluid thing.  Though you stop, put it down, go on about your life and come back to it, the story is fluid, or should be.  So, to me, dog-earing the pages is like telling the pages, even the words to stop going, stop moving because the crease is always there.  It stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene, stopped the monologue, or took a break between chapters.  It will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dog-eared indentation.  For me, the damage is permanent.  Literal and literary disrespect has occurred, something a book can never shake off.  So I use anything I can get my hands on to save my places.  I have bookmarks, but they never seem to find their way into the books.  In bookstore checkout lines I see pretty little bookmarks with clichéd phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate.  But my Pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because I know that the $3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one.  There is no real reason for this.  When I need to hold my place I franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading.  Beside my bed there are a number of books 'held' by varying objects.  The most frequently read book has my glasses holding court, the short story book that I dip in and out of is splayed, open side down on a table, a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book light™, a travel book on London is held in place with the thin, red, satin ribbon attached to it, and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside.   The receipt is my favorite placeholder.  I think this is partly sentimental in that every time I open the book I look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase.  Partly I'm sure I do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the $10.95 I spent on the paperback edition.  And partly because it's convenient and perfect.  A receipt takes up no space between the pages, it doesn't ask you to clip it on, it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark.  It's the answer to the damaging dog-ear.  It's the lazy woman’s pause button.  It's quite possibly the very best un-bookmark.  Yesterday I was digging through my assortment of not-yet-read books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside Carson McCullers' THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER.  I'm sure at the time, my former therapist's business/ appointment card was the closest thing around when I stopped reading.  I can't imagine that I just randomly put this card in this book.  It was slipped between pages 4 and 5.  A bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that I never really began reading it.  Maybe I went for a teaser from the first couple of pages.  I have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 20-50 pages into it, I pick up another book (see the bedside assortment listed above).  This is one of my worst habits and one I really hate. Commitment phobia rears it's ugly head in some many places in my life.  I just can't help but think there is a small, or rather quite large, message in THAT card in THAT book.  Sometimes I wonder...            "
"       I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now.  The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350º box.  The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil.  It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering.   My father gave me this container which describes its contents as 'The World’s Best Chicken Rub.'  He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of.  I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here.  I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where.  The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside.  Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family.  I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out.     The seasoning is described as a 'rub' and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken.  In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice.  A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus.  I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter.  I have made none so far.    The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night.  I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job.  I've never cooked a ham before.  Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them.  The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said 'brown sugar and mustard.'  'OK,' I thought 'but how the hell much of either one?'  I couldn’t ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of 'Have you learned nothing from me?' in her voice.  I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge.  I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred.  The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham.    Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture.  The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try.  My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away.  I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week.  I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory.  The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week.  I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks.  I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once.  (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your 'whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.')  Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge.  I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon.   In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my 'sisters.'  One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals.  We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins.  We thought our moms would be proud.  We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low.  During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice.  I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with.  A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes.  There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing.  But, right now my dinner's calling me.         "
"       Miraculously my blessed computer is now typing.  I have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters 'HJKL andM' into '1234 and 5.'  I took it to school today and I think maybe my baby didn't like being away from home.  I wasn't that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and I expect that everyday may be it's last day.  I have an order to send it in to Apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs.  This makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health.  But, I know I can’t do that.  So I'll have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures.  This is not that hard, just dump it on a disc, but I have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing.  What should take me about 2-3 hours will probably take me 2-3 days.  I'm just sentimental like that.    My laptop is my baby.  In fact, that's its name, My Baby.  In the upper right hand corner of my Macintosh G4 Titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words 'My Baby' underneath.  My laptop is one of my best friends.  Not like 'Oh I can’t wait to go home and type on my computer.'  But kinda.  And no, I'm not a computer nerd.  I use it for writing and Internet and well… music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so.  It's like a best friend who enjoys a good flick, listens to my favorite tunes, and doesn't disagree with my neurotic banter, AND travels with me almost everywhere I go.   This current computer is 2 years old, but is still fabulous.  When I bought my G4, my older G3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that I was crazy to buy another one and asked which one I liked better.  I stated that it was like choosing between two children, it was like Sophie's Choice, the Apple Macintosh version.  If you like Macs then you LOVE them.  There are few Mac people who could go either way, PC or Mac.  I am quite obsessed with my Macs.  I've had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with.  They are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use machines.  This is the first time I have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the Apple help line couldn't solve.  This is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby.  I'm scared, but today with the typing fiasco I came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing.  Then I realized that my G3 was still available.  I couldn't wait to get home and dig it out, to feel the tall, black keys under my fingers.  Pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough.  It makes writing fluid and effortless.  I miss that keypad.    When I opened the black chunky laptop I ran my hands over its edges.  The design team at Apple gave the G3 PowerBook curves, like a woman.  The edges are smooth and shapely; the sides of the computer make subtle 'S' shapes.  It's high fashion, computer style.  I miss the friendly rainbow Apple at the base of the screen.  It goes to show that Apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow Apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes.  Apple now goes for a sleek mono-colored, often white or grey, Apple, a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin.  The rest of my G3 is simple and elegant.  There are no extra buttons to 'go straight to the internet,' 'open you’re email,' or anything else that junks up a PC keyboard.  There could be key functions that did those things for me of course, but I get to decide, Apple does not predetermine my preferences.  I think the thing I love most about Apple is the company's adherence and strive for simplicity.  Their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button, not five.  Choices can complicate life.  A simple gift, that is was Apple has given us in its computers.  PC people think that we Mac people are strange.  'The whole world is Windows and you are using a Mac.  You poor deluded youth,' someone once told me.  I told him he better step back and then began my rant on why Macs reign supreme.  I was showing someone a keying shortcut on a Mac (like open Apple and s for save) and explaining the ease and simplicity of Macs and she said 'Oh, they got those shortcuts from Windows.'  I said, 'No you didn't' and then explained how Bill Gates just made a PC version of the perfected Mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on.  Deluded youth indeed.  My cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a PC, which is what she is currently doing.  She gets her Mac on at work.    It's a far better place at the top of world my friends.  Come to the land of milk and Apples, we are a friendly, simple-minded, and visionary bunch.  And remember... as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by Apple.    *Anna is OK with being in love with her computer.         "
"       My computer is on the blitz.  When I went to type today this is what I got: 2230234550300 and that was just hitting random letter keys.  Um, OK.  Have to send it off.  I'm scared they will erase it's memory and leave me with a shell of a computer and I will have to start all over.  But, I can't exactly do anything on it unless I develop a code language using 01234 and 5.  But, who has time for that?         "
"       Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?           "
"       This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year,  'I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...'  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.'  And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.'  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!          "
"       Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed.  Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house.  This is how it went down inside my head:  'Hmm.  Why is Best Buy closed?  What time is it?  It's only 4pm.  Oh yeah, Easter.  But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees.  Why are they all of a sudden holy?  More like Best Butt to me.  OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams.  Target is closed.  What the?  McDonald's?  You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy.  What?  Oh, Wal-Mart.  Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart.  Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full.  Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave?  Nordstrom, good for you.  You show them how to fear God, close you store.'  Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases.  I guess I am now a heathen.  Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all.    I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty.  I didn't even go to church yesterday.  This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church.  I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints).  So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food.  OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say.  But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser.  I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years.  Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute.

"       This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully).  All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London.   Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world.  After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out.  Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months.  So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself.  There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it.    Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went.  My family was not pleased AT ALL.  My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear?  I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared.  But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons.  So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up.  So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it.    It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say.  I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it.  A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone.  I've never had that feeling about that trip.  My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes.  I love it and I must do it.  I think I am my best self when I am traveling.  I'm an easy traveler.  I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan.  There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule.    I missed the traveling this break.  I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due.  Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head.  Oh well, there are always books to take me there.  I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist.  I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books.  They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney).  So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift).  So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day.  Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release.  Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now.     Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip.  It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious).  I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube).  So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station.  Sometimes, the universe just aligns.  And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete.           "
"       And by the devil I mean Uncle Sam.  I now have to sell my soul and get a second job.  Turns out, I do owe taxes (see 4/3/2004 post).  I went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type 'You owe (arrow) {a shitload}.'  Thanks Uncle Sam, thanks.  The reason why I owe in the first place is because I tutored some kids with Autism last year.  And, being the honest taxpayer that I am, I reported all income and expenses and now I owe.  That sucks.  Honesty, sometimes, not the best policy for my I-really-want-to-go-shopping-but-now-I-have-to-get-another-job self.  'O where o where has my little life gone?'  Over the hill to 'Do you need any help or are you just looking?'  I'm thinking Barnes and Noble again.  I love that place.  OK, so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters, but when I walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the Starbucks and the prettiness, oh the prettiness of it all.  I love that place.  I have to work there, not because I love it, but because I have to, to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and, oh god, will the cycle ever end?  Fraid not.          "
"       I hate it when I settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home.  There is nothing like a warm-hearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved.  I mean my friends are fabulous.  They are kind and funny and fun and far away.  Distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when I call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home, the loneliness gets deeper.  Their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and I go back to what I was doing before the desperate plea for conversation.    Tonight, I got 6 messages and 1 number out of service.  The latter was a friend of a friend that I've been meaning to have over for dinner, but come on people.  Then I think about why I wanted to talk anyway.  So much of the time I am just ranting on in my neurotic self-obsessed way and what is in it for them?  I hope that I am a good friend, but I know that have my bad moments.  One particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information.  She is a question asker and she is a lawyer.  She asks for more and more info. to the point that I have to stop myself and say 'OK, so what’s up with you?' about 45 mins. into our phone calls.  She is great, but she also feeds my self-obsession.  She's also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well.  Then there is my best friend who's mother is a school counselor, need I say more.  While she herself, doesn't have a degree in counseling, she's actually a science nerd, (you know I love you PK) she is fabulous at her second job.  And she does this for all her friends.  In fact, she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness. Hmmmmm!   The immediate lonliness was brought on by my re-watching of my 'Sex And The City' DVDs.  I just really miss my girlfriends sometimes.  I miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity.  My best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 2-24 driving hours away.  Oh, the mark of having successful, adventurous, independent women friends!    So, I sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place.  I think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones.  Are they out with other friends?  Are they watching a movie?  Are they discussing recently read books?  Are they organizing fundraisers?  Are they laughing?  Are they happy?  I hope they are laughing.  I hope they are happy.  They are my friends and I love them.           "
"       On Monday I started the possibility of the process of buying my own place.  I just met with a realtor, that's all, no paper-signing going on, no commitments, yet.  It's a scary thing this idea of home ownership, signing away your life for 30 years.  It's a good idea, financially, but mentally, is this good for me?    I have a few single girlfriends who have bought places.  Two friends in Richmond bought houses.  I think they have balls.  Not that home ownership is that big of a deal, but a house is a big deal.  I personally can't go that big.  The mowing, the pruning, roof replacement, window washing, it's too much.  I can barely handle keeping my 6-room apartment in orderly shape.  I can just imagine the letters from neighbors that I would get concerning the jungle that would certainly grow outside my home.  So a condo, a condo sounds good to me.  It's like an apartment, but I'd get to paint the walls and a tax deduction.    Condo searching is hard.  While I'm still in the beginning stages, I've already seen 3 in person and a bunch online.  Nothing has caught my eye.  I think I am waiting for the perfect one to just fall into my lap.  I'm picky, but open-minded.  I've told my realtor that I'm interested in city properties and no new construction.  I want an old, lived in, worn and wise place.  My very nice, my age, trying to sell me a place realtor took notes.  I checked for a ring. There was one.  What does it say about me when the men I am not attracted to are married?  Does that mean that somewhere out there there is someone who would love my winning personality and bright smile?  Oh, this is not blog about me wanting a relationship.  This is a blog about me wanting, something, a little more of myself, I guess.  There are friends who say, 'You will find him when you least expect it.'  A good friend who is getting married this summer tells every single girl who claims they are OK with being single that they should watch what they say because she felt the same way last year and poof she's getting married.  Well, with my relationship phobias, I haven't been expecting it for um, 27 years so, um where is the unexpected?  OK, I'm still not ready for all that commitment, so am I ready to commit to a condo?  We will surely see.           "
"       There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James 'Laid' CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to 'Laid' I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music.            "
"       that all the world should be taxed.  And so I went to a local tax place that was giving free tax service to teachers (gotta love those perks).  It took two nights because I had to wait the first night for another customer.  As I waited an older man who is a retired accountant and who's son owns the business began to organize my papers.  He was friendly and we talked for at least an hour.  Of course, he knew a lot about me because my life was displayed in numbers before him, but he also told me about his ex-wife who left him six months ago and all the improvements he had personally done on his house that he is now trying to sell.  While he was very kind and a great listener, this was all too much information, but I listened and nodded because he was helping me with finances.  When I left the first night after getting some of my information entered, I owed a boatload of taxes.  I was not happy and immediately began thinking of second jobs.  Barnes and Noble has been on my list for a while, but do I really want to work for a corporate monster at the lowest level?  OK, I'm a teacher, I really don't have much of a choice.  The next night was more promising, well financially at least.  When I walked in, the older man welcomed me and asked some more questions about my paperwork and then said he found a mistake the previous person had made that would save my taxes and actually grant me a return, a small one, but at least it was on the positive side.  I was ecstatic.  The clouds lifted and I would not have to sell my soul to pay my taxes.  He was quite pleased with himself as well and mentioned that he liked to see me smile more than three times.  I obliged him the smiles because he was, of course, saving my taxpaying ass.  This was a small outfit so all paperwork would be sent to a processing center to be checked and then I would have to come back to pick it up.  When I was ready to leave I went to shake his hand.  He held my hand well after the thank-you-for-your-help handshake and said 'The good news is that I get to see you one more time.'  I gave a quiet-I-don't-know-what-that-means giggle and turned and walked out.  As I left the store a scary thought went through my head, 'Did that old man just hit on me?'  He is not grandfather, really sweet older.  He's the just retired, wife just left me older.  Um, no.  I then began to think back to the conversations we had had over the past two nights.  Did he think there was more than accountant/ taxpayer information being past?    I have come to realize that I am clueless to men's flirting techniques, even when they are obvious.  This usually happens when there is no interest on my part and therefore why would I be looking for signs?  There was once the college friend who all of sudden told me he loved me.  I stopped being friends with him, pronto (I know, I'm a bitch, but he ended up gay so um, I think I was right).  There was a guy at a bar once who told me he had been staring at me and trying to pick me up for 1/2 hour.  I had no idea and I'm glad actually, he ended being quite cute and oh-so strange.  Then there was a guy at weekend long party who followed me around the whole first night until I realized after he told me that I was the kind of girl he wanted to marry that I really needed to just be around my girlfriends.  I hate those clueless girls, the ones who have guys swarming around them while they are supposedly oblivious.  I guess, sometimes we all are That Girl.  Regardless if the old tax-man was getting flirty or not, I can't help but feel that my tax refund is now just dirty money.          "

"       “I gotta go,” I squealed.  I was 4 years old, skinny with dark hair, pale skin and big brown eyes.  “I gotta go too,” said B.  She was 5 years old, skinny with blond hair and brown eyes.  We were beautiful together, the little girl version of yin and yang.  “Let’s go together,” one of us said.  So we raced to the upstairs bathroom, got ready and sat down together to pee.  We were giddy.  This was silly.  We were peeing together, our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet.  Our mothers thought it was precious.  This was our cousin thing, a little girl bonding time.  One mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture, B. with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub, me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall.  We are squeezed in, our hands holding on to the tips of the oval seat so we wouldn’t fall in or off.  Our clothes are simple knits, me in white, B. in dark blue; our shorts stuck to our legs have appliqué.  We are gorgeous.  We are smiling.  We are young.  We are silly.  We are happy.  It is one of my favorite pictures, B. and I concocting a simple plan to kill two birds with one stone.  I’m so glad there is a picture of that innocent time.  Sometimes B. and I will talk about our childhoods, how we grew up so differently yet share so much in common.  She is my blond size 2 cousin.  I am not her.  She is a modified hippie.  I am an ex-sorority girl.  Her mom is young and the least neurotic of her sisters.  My mom is not.  But we both have a factor in our blood that causes blood clots.  So do our mothers.  We are so different and so similar.  I am proud of her, that she is a brilliant photographer.  I love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children.  I’m glad she has found a man in a fairytale way, which we always dreamed would happen.  I love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells.  And I love that sometimes she will say, with laughter in her voice, “Anna, we use to pee together!”  “I know,” I say, laughing back, “I know.”         "
"       I  I don’t remember his name, but I remember the first time I met Autism.  I was in college doing a very short practicum.  It was, in fact, my first practicum.  I was placed with a special education teacher at a local elementary school.  Her classroom served kids of varying disabilities, but mostly kids with LD or mild MR. She practiced “inclusion” and this was my first experience with this hot topic in special education.  I observed her sitting at the back of a classroom with a small group of kids while the regular education classroom teacher led a lesson with the rest of the class.  “So this is inclusion,” I thought.  “This isn’t what I had in mind, but I could do this.  OK, I get it.”  But, I would do more than observe over my 3 short visits to that school.  I asked the special education teacher if I could help her.  I wanted to get in there with the kids.  They were, after all, why I was there.  She asked me to sit with a little boy and read with him to keep him occupied for a short while.  His social skills were strange to me.  He came to me when I asked, but never looked at my face.  His eyes darted quickly from on thing to another, mostly at floor or knee level.  He sat down with me on a couch in a corner of the classroom.  He was the first to open the book and he just took off reading before I could tell him what we were going to be doing.  I had no time to ask him about the title, the author, or the pictures.  I was amazed that he could read the book verbatim to me.  He was in 1st or 2nd grade and I knew his true reading skills surpassed his supposed ability.  I asked him questions as we read the story.  I wanted him to explain or expand on the pictures in the book.  His answers were “yes” or “no” if anything.  Mostly he ignored me.  It seemed he had no idea what we had shared together.  I remarked to his teacher later that I was very impressed with his reading, but wondered about why he couldn’t or didn’t answer my questions.  The teacher was busy and couldn’t quench my inquisitions.    I was so uninformed and inexperienced with Autism.  That teacher couldn’t have told me the answer to my questions.  Like Autism itself, the answers were complex.  II Mathew was four years old and on the flyer he had an angelic face with blond ringlets framing big blue eyes.  I answered the ad for a home-based teacher and began doing ABA therapy with Mathew in his home for 6 hrs. a week.  It took me only a few days to fall in love with him.  “This is good work,” I thought.  “This is what I was meant to do.”  I had another job that year in college working in the merchandise department for a famous band.  While I took phone orders and packed t-shirts all I could think about was Mathew and how the work with him was far more important than satisfying the sticker and CD wishes of teenagers.  I was anxious to stop working for the band and when summer ended I split my time between classes and Mathew.  I learned ABA well enough to do it in my sleep.  “What number? What letter?, Good job!, No, try again.” ran through my head, my dreams were flooded with discrete trials.    I worried about Mathew and whether I was really being effective.  I explained to friends and family that my work with Mathew was tedious.  I tried to put what we were doing into everyday language.  I said “We’re trying to introduce him to our world, one thing at a time.”  I don’t think my friends really grasped the idea, their puzzled faces said more than their encouraging words.  They feigned enthusiasm for my sake.  This was becoming my passion.    After a full year with Mathew I was tired of ABA.  Our sessions had become the same, the same drills, and the same goals.  I was bored.  I can’t imagine what Mathew was feeling.  He was making progress, but not enough that I could make sense of it.  I had seen one major improvement in him.  I told my parents one night during dinner on their drive through my college town that Mathew had made gains and I was so excited.  I was seeing that he was understanding what we were teaching him.  The example I gave was this:  Everyday when I see him I say “Hi Mathew,” and he answers “Hi Anna” usually with a flat affect and no eye contact.  I then say, “What are you doing?”  And there is silence.  I prompt him with “I’m sitting, I’m playing Nintendo, I’m reading a book, I’m watching TV, I’m eating…” He repeats my answer and I say “Good job” and we get to work.  We’ve done this a thousand times.  It’s just the way I greet him, nothing specific we are working on.  Then one day around the 7th month into my work with him I walk into his room and say my stock greeting “Hi Mathew.” “Hi Anna,” he says.  “What are you doing?”  “I’m bed,” he says quietly.  I stopped in mid-stride then I flew to him, picked him up, threw him in the air saying, “That’s right, you’re ON THE BED!  Good job!  I love it!”  I tickle him and we repeat the sequence, me shaping his words with a prompt. “I’m ON THE bed.”  This was a good day.  This was important.  He was understanding.  I would later learn in my education classes that Mathew had generalized the information we were teaching him.  He was “getting it,” but I was happy for the reprieve and change of pace that student teaching brought when I had to stop working with Mathew.  I continued to baby-sit and stay close with the family, but this was my last experience with hard-core ABA.  It was the foundation for my obsession with Autism.  It was a good learning experience.  It was important.  III  The first day of my student teaching I knew things would be very different for me.  This was a TEACCH classroom.  What I walked into was a mess, a scattered and colorful maze of bookshelves and desks.  The teacher and TAs were just putting everything together after a summer off.  There was a relaxed feel and yet there was so much to do. The teacher was a graying hippie who wore overalls and Birkenstocks, drove a red pickup truck and talked about her horse, Nelly.  She’d developed the classroom and program with a fellow teacher.  This was her baby.  She knew Autism backwards and forwards.  She was wise.  I knew I’d learn from her.  And I did.  The first day the kids arrived, 8 of them in all, I stood and watched and followed, mostly with my eyes and mouth wide open.  These kids talked in full sentences without prompting, the cared for their own belongings, they followed their own schedules, they played with typical peers, they asked for help, they were toilet trained.  “This is not Autism,” is all I could think.  I talked with the teacher that first school day when all the kids had left.  I had a million questions about each child.  “Why is Ethan so lethargic?  If Sadie didn’t talk when you first met her, how did she learn to talk?  Will Kathleen ever read?”  I knew I had to get used to fact that Mathew was not Autism and Autism was not Mathew.  That classroom proved the spectrum for me in terms of kids, in terms of methodologies.  Autism is a rainbow of colors, I got it.  IV Anthony’s parents came to school before school even began.  We had to amend his IEP.  He was switching schools to my newly formed Autism classroom and he would be held back in kindergarten for one more try.  His mother and father were originally from India.  They spoke English, but I still found myself speaking loudly and repeating things in simple phrases.  I needed to feel that they understood me because I couldn’t understand them.  Anthony’s first day in my classroom for kids with Autism was my first day too.  We both had no idea what we were in for.  Anthony would spend half a day in kindergarten sharing a TA with another student and half a day with me working academics and adaptive skills.  Anthony worked hard and was rewarded with playtime.  He spent a lot of him playtime having figures interact or simply talking gibberish to himself.  He knew English, but would only speak when prompted.  His parent assured us that they only spoke English at home.  This was important for him to learn one language given his challenges.  His parents were adamant and I believed them, they didn’t understand him very much either.  He made no eye contact unless I cupped my hands around his big beautiful brown eyes and put him face to mine.  Anthony was a puzzle and he worried me.  Then, we began to acknowledge his sounds and anytime he used an English word appropriately we threw a small party.  Soon Anthony was throwing his own parties.  He would show us his artwork enthusiastically exclaiming, “Look.  Oh it’s beautiful.  Good job Anthony!”  When he would answer a question he would automatically congratulate himself, “Yes, good job!”  We would agree with him and then laugh with him.  We knew he was repeating us, but we couldn’t have paid for that pride or that growth.  We took it and embraced it, Anthony was awakening.  Slowly and surely Anthony made strides.  He quickly learned to read alongside his peers.  He was counting and making patterns.  His comprehension was always a bit of a challenge, but by 3rd grade he was working on grade level and fully included in his regular education classroom.  He even had friends.  Anthony was an exception.  He was bright and his parents worked with him constantly.  He is only one of many success stories, but his is one I think of often in terms of extremes.  His speech pathologist would often say to me when I was discouraged,  “Anna, when we tried to evaluate him his first year in kindergarten he was a mess.  He would sit in his classroom in the corner, rocking and saying gibberish.”    Turns out, there was no gibberish there, just words that needed shaping and a little boy who needed lots and lots of encouragement and laughter.  We happily gave it to him.   V  Autism is a neurological disorder that stems from deficits in social and communication skills and coincides with repetitive behaviors.  I often speak of Autism’s umbrella, how ADD and OCD and MR can all be part of a child’s diagnosis, but I always feel I fall short when explaining the true nature of the disorder.  This is hard for me because I can’t possibly relay all the stories and images that had led to my understanding and yet without those stories and images my understanding is weak.  I want people to automatically see what I mean when I try to describe how this disorder can present itself and I am so careful that I don’t leave a Rainman image, a one man show of a multi-faced disability.  I think I always fail; Rainman is more visual than my words can ever be.  And this too is what frustrates me when trying to explain my philosophy in educating people with Autism.  Contrary to my beginning with this disorder, I believe in a highly eclectic approach filled with speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration, floortime, inclusion, schedules, behavior plans, varied opportunities, generalization, varied teaching materials and methods, all under a child centered, extremely structured environment.  And above all I believe in spontaneity with these students.  How can you be spontaneous in a highly structured environment?  Easy, make sure the structure allows for freedom and the kids will blossom.          "
"       I see the skyline of New York and my stomach does flips.  I want that city.  I crave that city.  When I unexpectedly come across a picture of New York’s skyline, I take in the scene and then have to look away.  I can’t look too long because the stomach flip will turn into an aching.  So, I move on and begin to plan a trip back to Gotham.   I’ve only visited on short trips.  Sometimes my visits were so brief they were merely a tease.  A one-nighter for a private concert, a one-night lay over to the Dominican, and a lunch on Spring Street in January with snow falling while passing through town.  No matter the time I’ve spent in NYC, the city is always with me.    This past December I told my friend shortly after we emerged from Penn Station that I just felt at home in the city.  There is so much life in New York and this is what I love must about it.  Of course there is life everywhere, but in NYC it is at its most vibrant.  I love that there are people crashing into you on the sidewalks.  I love that you can hear the streets and sirens at 4am on the 25thfloor of an apartment building.  I love the subways and buses carrying strangers to a million different places.  I love that there is a giant patch of green in the middle of the chaos to offer a reprieve and that inside that escape the skyline still impresses its buildings, gesturing to come back into the fray.  I consume as much media related to New York as I can.  I watch every documentary I find, rent movies with that take place in New York, read books with NYC as the setting, and read blogs of NYC dwellers.  Obsession would be a good word for it, but my fascination is more of a hobby.  I think about moving there and then life goes on and I forget about it or convince myself that it’s not really what I want, that I need to cultivate the roots here and stay near my family whom I love.  But, when I see a picture of New York’s skyline, my stomach tells me to go back to the obsessing, to get online and find a job and an apartment in the city, to forget the ties in Virginia and to make that leap.  I know, I know.  Why not?  Well, I have no answer.  All I can say is give me a year, we’ll see.          "

"       At one point during every season, save for summer, I think that this season is my favorite time of the year.    I love the point in fall when the leaves have turned their autumnal colors and there is a crispness to the air that only happens in late September and early October.  Fall smells like new backpacks and fresh notebooks.  For me, fall signals beginnings though most of nature is ending or falling into a slumber.   Winter brings the snow that quiets and cleanses everything under its blanket, and this usually brings rest from the harried school days.  I love the cold and chilled air of winter, sleeping under a thickly feathered duvet and throwing on handmade scarves to snuggle my neck.      My favorite thing about spring are the honeysuckle flowers.  Spring sneaks up on me every year.  I grow use to the barren trees of winter and somehow don’t notice the buds and tinges of green that Spring pushes through.  Then one day, all of a sudden, there are no more branches on the trees, hillsides cascade with green, houses are hidden behind rows or clumps of leaves and flowers, and shade gracefully covers the precious areas under the trees' new dress.    But, honeysuckle.  It's an amazing testament of re-growth.  It grows wild along highways, alleys, schoolyards, and backyards, any place with a fence to lend climbing space.  The bushes are everywhere and when a small honeysuckle breeze blows and catches me off guard I am seven again, standing in my front yard on the left side of the house near the alley with my brother and neighborhood friends.  The bushes are full grown and you can't be outside without the sweetness luring you.  We would gather round the bushes picking the yellow and white flowers as quickly as we could.  We wanted as much sweetness as we could get, but we were hindered by our work.  Stealing honeysuckle juice is a delicate task.  You must be careful to pluck the whole flower from the bush.  Then gently holding the flower midway up the petals between two fingers on one hand, you pinch the bottom green mass between two fingers on the other hand and pull.  The pulling must be slow.  You must feel the tiny yellow ball at the end of the delicate stem slipping through the petals, grabbing and pushing the honey out of the small hole you've made in the flower.  Then quickly move the flower and stem to your tongue a moment before you pull the stem from the flower and feel the tiny tickle of sweet, watery honey.  It's spring.  Your tongue has confirmed it.  Life is beginning again.            "
"       I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing 'SAT word' novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These 'novels' are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  'Sir Gawain' and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read 'SAT vocab.' novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?  I doubt it.            "
"       Tonight going to my good friend's house to watch the finale of friends (um finally, thank God) I was driving to the middle of nowhere.  I hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and $2.50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town.  So driving, I saw this mini cooper with the license plate 'SUVS SUC.'  Now, I know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone, but I really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my SUV.  I'd squash him.  He'd be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my Sport (luxury) Utility (hauling shoes and pretty purses) Vehicle.  So, you mini man, watch who you're picking on.   And my best friend is getting married and sometimes this makes me cry.  Like tonight, it finally hit me and I cried.    PS-  I love mini coopers, being obsessed with all things British.  But, don't mess with my SUV!         "
"       Of course I've thought about it happening.  I've envisioned how it would happen and what I might do.  I've considered that I should devise a plan if it happened, just to be prepared.  Well, it happened and I had no plan, no diagram to show me what to do.    This morning I woke up with a headache thinking, as I do every morning, that I just want to get back in bed, I want to call in sick.  But, I never do call in sick.  I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, fix lunch and when the coffee is ready I begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain.  This morning, the coffee couldn't work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen.  Praying to the over-the-counter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain, I began looking for my keys.  I couldn't find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard.  So I grabbed the spare set with it's spare car key, spare car remote clicker thing, and spare apartment key.  The clicker thing was the slightly used one I had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run it’s course.  It's a sad little keychain with only the three danglers, but it would have to do, I was running late.    It was a wet morning and this time I remembered my spare umbrella in case the heaven's opened up on me as I went from school to school.  I stepped out of my apartment, coffee in hand and as I approached my car, the spare clicker wasn't working.  I figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the driver's side door with my key.  I then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door (I know, not really manually).  Nothing happened.  I was confused.  I hopped in, put my bags on the passenger seat, set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition.  Upon turning it, I got nothing.  I mean nothing, not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when it’s trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead.  All signs were pointing to a dead battery, but no noise, that was strange.  I was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days.    Here is where I needed the plan and had none.  I first said a quick thank you to God that I was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in.  What do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already.  I called my brother, he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work I couldn’t travel to my other schools and I'd have to take care of the car today anyway.  So, I had to call in.  I was getting my early morning wish, but really, this was not the way I had wanted it.  Having no plan I couldn’t figure out how to call in: Do I call in sick or is this personal business?  Do I call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and I figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day?  Who can help me?  How long with AAA take?    I ended up calling in for the whole day.  Car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so I thought I would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time.  It all worked out.  The dealership was able to (expensively) fix everything by the end of the day and I can go to school easily and safely again.  I'm just wondering, do you have a plan if it happens to you?          "
"       This past weekend I went to Winston-Salem, NC to a cousin's wedding, on my dad's side.  I am not close to this side of my family; my dad having only brothers and brothers are less likely to gather their respective families together often enough for children to form bonds.  I do see my cousin A. every Thanksgiving at our house though I don't really know her.  She is, however, sweet and kind and so I was happy to go to her wedding.  I was, however, happier to also spend time with my Cousin Loves A. and R. from my mother's side.  My mother has two sisters and while both live in different cities in North Carolina, all of our families have grown up together.  We have spent almost every holiday together, camping vacations at the beach, and weeks at Lake Norman, NC.  My cousin's and I (a total of 3 girls and 1 boy) haven't always been great friends, but we were great playmates growing up.  We were around each other so much that it seemed like we were brothers and sisters.  We played, we fought, we played again, and then we went to college.  When we grew older we became friends.  Trips to visit each other and weekly phone calls developed.  We became good friends, we were happy our mothers brought us together, we were happy for our Cousin Love.  Cousin Love is how we address each other and we do it with a southern drawl.  It ends up sounding like 'cuzzin luuuuv.'  It is merely a way to say, 'I'm glad you're in my life.  I'm glad you’re my cousin and I love you.'    Cousin Loves have begun to multiply.  There are now wives and soon-to-be husbands and I'm sure there will be children soon too.  We welcome the additions and affectionately extend the Cousin Love name.  Our children will continue to be cousins though growing more and more distant in a familial since.  We know they will grow up together, we hope too that they will develop innocent Cousin Love and see the joy of friendship that we have.  We have a tentative plan to save our monies and buy a beach house.  We want to name it Cousin Love, but know that the world would think us odd.  So, in Spanish it would be 'Primo Amor.'  And in Italian, it also means 'first love' and this sounds good to us.  So, this past Friday night, after the rehearsal dinner for A.'s wedding I took my newly found cousin from my father's side over to A. and R.'s house for some quality time.  It was fun, good drinks, good conversation.  It was like we had all been friends forever.  It was what Cousin Love is all about.  And my cousin R. from my dad's side blended right in.  In fact, we've convinced her to come to Thanksgiving this year, to continue and expand the Cousin Love.  The Cousin Love was so good I felt full up, full up of the kind of love that lets your know you have all you need in the world.  The next night at A.'s wedding I sat with my mom and dad, my dad's cousins, one of my dad's brothers, and my cousin R. as we watched A. and B. swish around the room.  They did their prescribed wedding things: the first dance as husband and wife, the father-daughter dance, the cake cutting, and the throwing of the garter.  As I watched them cut the cake I felt full up again.  I felt no envy of A. and B. at that moment.  There was no sense that I was missing something.  I realized then that I love my family, I love my life, and I am happy.  Full up, indeed.         "
"       How do we meet them?  When do we know they will be important in our lives?  What are the signs that certain people are meant to change you, permanently?    This weekend I found a good friend, and luckily, she is part of my family.  At our mutual cousin's wedding we met again after probably 15 years.  I don't even remember the last time I saw her but it was probably at our North Carolina family reunion, eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame.  Surrounded by family I didn't know very well and in the mist of teenage angst I guess I didn't realize what an amazing person R. would grow to be.  Funnily too, we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet.    R. currently lives in NYC pursuing her passion, poetry.  She’s been through college, graduate school and now another masters degree for writing.  She's lived almost a whole life since we last talked and I guess, I have too.  We talked about NYC and my passion for that city and about poetry.  We have more in common than I can believe.  She is someone I wish had always been in my life and she was, I just didn't know it.  The cousin's wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances.  A. and B. had gone to high school together, but didn't run in the same circles.  They both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown.  Their friends say that A. and B. are perfect together, they compliment each other, and that they are deeply in love.    Why does it take years, sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you can't even fathom?  It is as if we are not ready at times.  Friends, lovers, husbands, and wives may pass us along the street, but until we have fully grown into ourselves, it doesn't matter how often we meet.  When we are ready, hopefully they will be there.  It's as if we are all just ships passing in the night and I'm so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction.         "
"       My parents are here.  They are taking care of me which is nice since the tetanus shot has ruined my left arm, I got a splinter in my good foot hopping around, and all of my muscles are sore from having to be used all of a sudden in ways they are not used to.  Anyway, enough of the moaning and groaning, I should be half-walking in a few days.    My family is taking me to the beach to be waited on.  I can’t go in the sun with the antibiotics that I’m on and I can’t get my foot wet.  It’s all good; I don’t like the sand and saltwater anyway.  So, I’m off for a week.  I’m being driven 4 hours to sit in a house and have people bring me things.  I’ll be knitting up a storm and reading and watching my little nieces and nephew play.  I wish I could play with them.  So, no blogging for a week.  Come back, I’m sure I’ll have lots to say when I return to you as long as you return to me.         "
"       And it seems I should have stayed there.  The infection is way better today, but I was really groggy from the vicodin this morning.  I had to take it last night to sleep through the pain.  Then, this morning, I went to fix some eggs and toast and just when I was going to put the food on the plate I stepped on a blade that had fallen from a cabinet that I forgot about and didn’t see.  I sliced my foot wide open and now have 6 stitches.  I’ve never had stitches and I was not the best patient for the poor doctor.  This has been a rough two days.  I’m going to bed and please don’t call cause I can't walk to get the phone.           "
"       So, I have an infection and from 6 to 10:45pm was in some SERIOUS pain.  I went to a prompt care place nearby and pretty much cried the whole time as the pain got worse and worse.  I thought about not going, about toughing it out.  I don’t like to look like a hypochondriac, but after phone calls to mom and the worsening of the pain, I couldn’t not go.  I’ve never seen any of the staff before and I went by myself so I’m sure the staff saw this crying girl and was like “Ok, what’s going on there?”  As they sent me from the bathroom to x-ray room to testing room and 2 people walked in on me undressing then dressing, I cried.  I cried around the nurse, the doctor, the x-ray tech.  I winced and moaned and squirmed like I was having a baby.  I’m not a crier and as a woman I can handle pain in the abdominal area pretty well.  I couldn’t stop the tears, the pain was too much.  So, after all the testing (and crying), the doctor on call gave me a bottle of vicodin.  I think he felt sorry for me.  I’ve taken the other meds, but not the vicodin yet.  That powerful a drug scares me.  And, thanks to the beautiful power of antibiotics (we are talkin’ serious ones here) and gentle Tylenol, I can walk and sit without moaning.  I love medicine.  I love doctors.  And, I’m sure if I take the vicodin, I’ll love you too.         "
"       Yesterday, the phone rang while I was brushing my teeth.  Mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing, I run around looking for my cell phone.  When I locate it deep in the depths of my purse I don’t recognize the number and think that I need to answer it quickly.   And then, like a dumbass, I do.  My muffled “hello” allows the person on the other end to identify himself.  While he does so I’m thinking “What do I do now?  I can’t talk like this.  Do I swallow it (ew) or spit while he’s on the phone.  What. The. Hell?”  I decide on spitting and just confess it, he’s already heard me sound as if I’m under water.  So I say “Hold on, I’m brushing my teeth,” then go to the sink to spit, sonic turned off but still in my hand.  I apologize to him when I return and hope that he didn’t hear me spitting in the sink, 3 feet away from the phone.  I realize; what a dumbass, like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste.  What, what was I thinking?  Sometimes, I wonder.         "
"       I’ve realized it is real work being a girl.  The maintenance is insane and usually I am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing.  I usually get things done on a whim or because I can’t take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore.  Home upkeep is far cheaper, but I am far from skilled enough to keep it up.  I try for a few weeks and then I have to revert to the professionals.   I’ve never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that I go to excusively.  A college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more.  I don’t understand that.  Sure, a good hairstylist is hard to find, but there are several out there, in every city.    I’ve never had a fear of the haircuts either.  I’ve walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do.  Some stylists like this, others, not so much.  I haven’t really ever had a bad experience.  One hairdresser said that I didn’t have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have.  I think she was complimenting me.  She also gave me one of the best haircuts and I ended up going back to her a few times.  In the 10 months that I've lived in Richmond I've had my hair cut three times by three different people, none were bad, but none were exceptional either.  Today, my stylist was Daniel, a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo.  I was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked.  There is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs.  I told him I just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said we’d do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair.  He worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have.  He plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once.  He massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked.  He relaxed me.  He took his time and care.     I was disappointed that he didn’t massage my head when he shampooed my hair.  I expected he was an extended massager, he wasn’t.  As we walked to his styling chair I wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair, to put his spin on it.  As he was combing out I my hair, I wanted to tell him to be creative, do what he thought was best for my face.  I never did.  I sat quietly and watched the other customers.  He never asked how much I wanted taken off.  He just took my hair and started cutting.  He cut it to a healthy length, parted it down the middle and added subtle layers.  He did this without asking or telling me.  He cut and cut and cut, the layers taking time and many head tilts.    When he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under, a skill I can never get down.  He didn’t talk much, nor did I, but when he did he said things like “rock and roll” and “twisted.”  With these words, I realized we couldn’t be friends.    Hours after meeting him, he lingers.  When my hair swishes or I brush it out of my face, I smell him, cigarettes and herbs.  In the time that I walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle, Daniel became my hairdresser.  I’m committing to him like no other man.  I know at least he will take his time and care and he'll give me what I need without even asking.          "
"       For week’s I have been wondering when exactly Father’s Day is.  I know of course, that it’s in June and on a Sunday.  But I feel like it moves around from year to year.  I have, however, just learned that it’s always the 3rd Sunday of June each year.  Hmm, I really have trouble with dates.  I’m horrible at birthdays.  Actually, horrible is probably not strong enough a word.  My best friend and I will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late.  But, we know that’s the way it is and we accept it, wholeheartedly.  Others, however, are not so kind.  I’ve known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays.  That’s just damn selfish in my opinion.  I don’t know.  I’m not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been.  I’m trying to get better at it, but dates elude me.  Like today, I was reading my daily blogs when   urlLink Jennifer Weiner’s post  mention’s father’s day and I have one of those “Oh my God, I’ve got to call my Dad” moments.  I ran around looking for my cell phone and as I’m talking to my Dad I realize that I have not sent a card or anything.  I quickly realize I will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week, but still shitty, shitty of me.  I sent my Mom a Mom’s day card (a day late of course), but nothing for my old Dad, who loves me so unconditionally.  Sorry Dad.  It’s not personal, I just suck.  Well, I guess in my case, we’ve established why there is no Daughter’s Day.  On the bright side, maybe the Father’s Day cards will be half-price tomorrow.         "
"       Cellophane.  It’s my new favorite wrapping material.  I’ve just wrapped 2 presents for today’s scheduled parties and yes, one is wedding related and yes, I’m over it.  As I went through my quite vast assortment of wrapping material I landed on the cellophane for the first package because I had to due to it’s odd shape and then I just had to us the cellophane again for the next one, it’s just too fun.  And, while wrapping, I walked around singing “Cellophane, Mister cellophane” from Chicago.  And now, I’m just chillin’ before I have to leave to drive all over Virginia in one day.  I’m usually a last minute shopper and would typically be out buying the presents right now. But, I’ve learned to stockpile presents so that I can just pull from the bunch and go.  But, my last minuteness is not totally gone, I’m really waiting on my clothes in the dryer and I was suppose to leave like 5 minutes ago.  Oh well, people love me anyway, despite all the lateness and last minute presents, tags still on.  I am, in fact, not Miss Cellophane cause you gotta notice the girl who is fashionably late.          "
"       Last night, at about 9:30 I had the bright idea of going to see “Raising Helen.”  Some friends had already seen it and since I had no work the next day I could handle to the late night showing at 9:55.  So, I hopped in the car and raced to the West End to the stadium seats.  It was me, and three couples.  Wonderful, nothing like smug couples on a Thursday night date.  Whatever.  I took my own row, settled in and put my feet up.  I love the movies.  I started going to movies alone about 5 years ago when in college an impossibly popular co-worker divulged her love of going to movies on her own.  I was appalled and shocked.  Why in the hell would a 20 year-old, blond, size 2, charming, and smart girl ever go to the movies by herself?  She explained that her mother did it and that she liked it.  She would often be shopping and find a movie on and just go.  I thought she was brave.   It took me a good year before I braved the movies alone.  It must have been uneventful, as I don’t even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity.  Now, I don’t even think twice about it and yet I think I’m still a bit of a rebel in the venture.  I don’t think my friends do this.  I even have a friend who doesn’t like to rent movies alone. Movie watching is a solitary act anyway, unless, of course, you are at home snuggled up on a couch.  So, if a movie is out that I want to see and no one else does, or I’m near a movie theatre and see something interesting, or I’m bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself, I’ll go to a movie, alone.  No big deal, it just happens.  So, last night was “Raising Helen.”    Sad bit of a movie if you ask me.  The plot was weak and lame and not well thought out.  There were scenes were I literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although it’s a different day.  This movie overall has bad writing, bad editing, and not really great acting although I still adore Kate Hudson, John Corbett, and Joan Cusak.  What were they thinking?  Anyway, good premise, just not well done.  And, I’m beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was “so cute.”     And then, because I could, I went Wal-marting at midnight.  I stepped into the Wal-mart at 12:15am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center.  It was fabulous and surreal.   Tons of people were about, mostly Wal-mart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers.  There were boxes everywhere, which you had to navigate around.   The restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that I was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a Thursday.  Please, like it’s not weird that you are working at Wal-mart in the middle of the night.  Yarn was had because well, the kitting has not stopped.  And then, because I could, I got some fresh produce and checked out at 1am.  Wonder if that is what Sam Walton envisioned for his supper store?            "
"       So, I went to the doctor yesterday to get a mole checked out.  Since I had blistering sunburn 10 years ago, I have been cautious with suspicious items on my skin.  Turns out that melanoma does not necessarily strike the area that was burned (interesting).  And the mole or whatever seems to be nothing (thank God).  This was my first visit to this doctor in Richmond so I had to fill out all the info. sheets and sign away my life, literally.  Well, since it was the last day of school I had a little trouble leaving when I wanted to and then when I got to the hospital there was an unexpected game of chicken for the limited parking spaces.  So, I finally grab one and walk quickly through the soupy, muggy air (wearing jeans no less) and make it to the fourth floor about 7 minutes late for the appointment.  I get my papers and sit down.  I write and write and then pause to actually read the clauses before I sign them when the receptionist moves the glass plate that blocks out the waiting area (um, it’s glass people, we can still see and hear you) and this is what she says “Miss Banana, the nurse is waiting for you because she was expecting you at 3:30.  Can you write faster because you’re late?”  “Yeah, OK,” I say.  And then it dawns on me that I should have stood up on a chair or something and announced to the waiting area “Hi, my name is Anna and I’ll be late today.”          "
"       I woke up early this morning to a fog, a thick fog over the city.  It nestled in the trees in the courtyard of my apartment building.  It was tranquil and quieted the morning like a blanket of snow.  I haven't seen a fog in years, probably becuase I sleep through them.  But today, the fog  mimiced the fog I've been under for the last few days.  Not a bad fog, just a mindless, in a daze fog where I leave important, confidential documents on a copier, don't put an important piece of info. into folders, can't comprehend questions asked of me, can't understand what I am reading. I've been in a haze but, now, it's mid-day and the fog is gone, the sun has burned it away.  It's the last day for teachers, my files are completed, I've helped other teachers clean up their rooms and mail letters home.  School is out.  We're done.  One year down, a million more to go.  But, for now, for the summer, I'm free.  Plans for the beach, LA, and NYC are being made, and of course all the weddings.  Happiness abounds with the sunshine raining down.  Pool days and sleeping in and reading books and unexpected trips and movies and relaxation and freedom.  It's good to be a teacher when it's summer in the city.         "
"       Sex and The City on TBS. The girls are back.  Fall in love people, all over again.          "
"       And by that I mean Knitters Anonymous because I am addicted.  I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining 'I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf.'  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.  Enough with the wedding stuff already.  The showers and the bachelorette parties and the girl's weekends and the weddings.  I mean there is no money left, the well is dry.  I'm really going to be weddinged out by November.  'Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.  Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.'  Or maybe, I'll just bring my knitting and then it will all be bareable.         "
"       Woke up around 11:30 which really not that late, but considering it was drunk sleep, it was far to early.  Too much bachelorette partying.  My head hurt and I felt like a ton of bricks hit me so back to bed I went at 2 pm for a long nap.  I don't even know how I got that drunk or if I was that drunk.  I didn't drink that much, although people were handing us shots all night, but those fruity shots don't have much alcohol in them.  And, I had my wits about me at the end of the night.  I was probbably the most sobber one there.  So, what the hell with the hangover?  Anyway, it's currently 5pm and I need to get on with my day, or what's left of it.           "
"       It’s summer, well almost and not officially, but heat wise; it is summer in the city.  Poor Virginia, it is plagued with humidity and hot summers.  I know our summers are not like Texas summers or Louisiana summers, but they are hot enough for me.  I don’t believe in snootiness, but sometimes I wish I were a person who “summers” somewhere else if just to get away from the nastiness.  Maine, Maine sounds good, or maybe even Canada.    The only thing really good about the heat is that pools open and there are trips to natural bodies of water.  Every year my family takes a beach trip. I actually hate sand and saltwater, but I love the laziness of a beach week.  I take about ten books and I just read and play with children and read some more.  And then there is, of course, the eating of the shrimp and crab.  There is always the eating of the shrimp and crab.  But, before and after the beach, there is the pool.  Growing up we belonged to our local Elks Club, an organization I really don’t understand except that there were usually old men there at any given time throughout the day and they could be found at the bar inside the clubhouse.  I’ve never found out what the organization stood for or against and as soon as the last child (me) went to college, my father’s membership ran out.  We used the place for the pool and the pool only.  The local pool, a place where you learn to swim from the coolest man you have ever seen because he wears sunglasses underwater, where you strengthen friendships over adult swim breaks and during “shark” in the deep end, and where you tackle the fear of the “high dive.”  I never joined the swim team, but I was a lifeguard for 2 summers.  Lifeguarding is the best job ever invented.  Sometimes I think about going back to lifeguarding with my summers off, but then I think that the current 16 year olds would find me a bit strange and I would certainly not fit into their lifeguarding clique.  That’s OK.  I got my lifeguarding kicks back in the day anyway.  I just really miss the twirling, the twirling of the whistle while sitting in the tall chair with a high vantage point, the sun so strong you can see your legs tanning before you eyes.  The pool is now what I go to with my nieces and nephew.  None know how to swim yet, but I am determined to solve that one.  My favorite thing to do with them is to take each one, individually, in my arms and pull them across the pool from the shallow to the deep end.  On the cross-pool treks, our faces close together, we pretend different things, sometimes they practice kicking or just floating.  When water rushes into their mouth and nose I know it’s a 50/50 chance of them quitting the trek mid-pool.  But, the other day, my precious niece coughed it out and swallowed hard then said, in three year-old voice, “Annie, I want to ride the waves again.”  You see, we were pretending to be on the ocean and waves were gently bouncing us up and down (hence the water in the nose from the crashing wave).  I love the pool.  I love that it turns a three year-old into a chlorine swallowing wave rider.         "
"       There is this guy I know, but he shall remain nameless, although I might be related to him.  I adore this guy.  He is one of the funniest people I know and whenever I am around him I know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over.  However, last night I discovered he is the biggest dork I know.  And this is why.    We both love Apple.  We are both obsessed with Apple.  Like last week I emailed him about the new  urlLink Apple Airport Express  and he emails me back and is like “I was reading about it just when you emailed.”  And then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that Apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an Apple and businesses were run on Apples.  We discover it is a futile attempt, but our love for Apple will never die.  This guy is a certified Windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at Microsoft so his love for Apple is even more special than mine.  He converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since.  In fact, he’s a little pissed at people who like PCs.  He loves Apple so much that he gets magazines about Apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating. I know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them.  It’s all a business related obsession since he programs all day. I have to confess that if I understood all that computer jargon, I would be in on it too.  I just don’t have time to learn all that stuff about computers, I just know I love Apple.  I also know that he is my Apple lovin' hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should I have a technical quetions.  He rocks my Apple lovin' world.    Well, so last night he was telling me about the last issue of  urlLink Mac World .    urlLink Alton Brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate Apple.  The name of the dish is APPLE MACaroni and Cheese.  “Ew,” he said.  “Yeah, weird,” I said.  Then, this guy that I adore,went on to tell me that at the last Mac Expo (or whatever) when Steve Jobs gave his closing statement, he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating MACaroni and then for dessert they had APPLEsauce.  Oh, dear one, I still, still, adore the hell out of you!           "
"       Ronald Regan's body will be lying in state on Thursday at the capitol in DC.  I’m thinking about going.  Although I don’t really have the money to spend on gas, when will I ever get to see a president lying in state in the near future?  And really it’s not about the pomp and circumstance, it’s about Ronnie.    He’s the only president I feel personally connected to and it’s not about his politics or his cuddly nature and love for his wife or that even a president can be human and have family problems too.  It’s about birthdays.  You see, ole Ronnie and I have the same birthday.  Big deal you say, you also share it with Bob Marley.  But, Bob didn’t send me a birthday letter when he was president.  Ronnie did.  It was 1988, I was eleven and this was the last year for Reagan in the White House.  I thought my sharing his birthday was the coolest thing.  I had no idea what his politics where nor did I care.  I considered myself a Republican then because my parents were Republicans and so this extra kinship with Ronnie felt strong.    My mom had the brilliant idea of sending him a birthday card and announcing the importance of the shared date.  I was a little apprehensive, how exactly do you tell a stranger, much less a president, that you have the same birthday?  Why would he even care?  Well, we bought a card and wrote a note.  I’m sure my mom helped craft the sentence or else it would have been something like “I was born on Feb. 6 too.  Happy Birthday Mr. President.”   And, well, that’s probably what it did say.  So, off went the card and about 3 weeks later arrived a letter from the White House.  It was the most exciting day of my eleven year-old life.  My family was thrilled too.  I learned of his death on Saturday night after a full day spent with old college friends.  A friend was looking at the now framed letter on my living room wall and said that Reagan had died today.  “What?” I thought.  Then I thought about peace and that it seemed so expected and so natural.  I’ve dealt with Alzheimer's in my family and it is trying disease, on everyone.  I told my friends that it was probably for the best for him and his family.  Then I went to the letter.  He, or a staff writer, wrote a short and sweet letter.  It is typed on a typewriter.  The date is off-center from the letterhead and the eagle emblem.  It begins by acknowledging our “mutual birthday.”  Then, in presidential fashion, goes into the history of Febuuary birthdays including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  He tells me to study these great men and hopes they will inspire me the way they have inspired him.  The letter ends with Mrs. Raegan joining him in his wishes and may God bless me. His name is signed simply “Ronald Reagan,” no mention of president anywhere.    We think he really signed it.  It doesn’t seem to be a stamp.  I will probably never truly know. But, it doesn’t matter.  My eleven year-old heart knows he touched this letter somehow.  In the bottom left hand corner is my full name and childhood address.  My name has a typo.  Since the beginning of the letter I have gone from Anna to Anny.  At eleven, this typo crushed me.  Now, it is endearing.  It makes the whole letter so much more real, so much like the man who’s birthday I share.     Dear President Reagan,  I am honored to have shared your birthday.  Every February 6 I will continue to remember your birthday and those of the other great presidents you mentioned.  Washington and Lincoln were truly amazing, but they don’t mean as much to me.  I can’t look over at my wall and see their handwriting.  I loved your letter and will always cherish it.   May you and your family find the peace you deserve and thank you, from my eleven year-old self and from me now, for all you did for our world.  Sincerely, Anny         "
"       J. is a “military brat.”  She’s been all over the country and Germany, her family moving from place to place every few years.  Somehow she has roots in the mid-west and Virginia.  I’m thankful for those Virginia roots, happy they brought her friendship to my door, literally.  Ohio claimed her during undergrad.  She was a Buckeye.  I guess she still is.  I’d like to think she is more a Wahoo, but it’s not my choice who wins out.  The Buckeyes could probably kick our Wahoo’s football ass any day.  J. now lives in Austin and owns a home there.  Her settlement came by way of Miami and Seattle, her traveling childhood brought to the surface in young professionalhood.  She’s an audiologist.  I think she is resilient.  She lived 3 doors down from me in one of Thomas Jefferson’s original rooms at his University.  We had fireplaces, wood floors, a sink inside a closet, and a bathroom we had to walk outside to use.  Not exactly an outhouse, but close enough.  We were in grad. school, but J. was only there for one semester.  We spent hours chatting in our rooms, at night walking from room to room in our pajamas, outside.  When she left it was winter and cold, the freezing temps. had been lifted by fires in our fireplaces.  Our individual rooms heated the old fashion way.  J. was the best at making a fire that didn’t smoke the room out.    I was sad to see her go and begged her to stay, to change her practicum placement to Virginia, not Kentucky.  But her plans were made far before any of us moved to the Range.  So she left but came back for Foxfields and a New Year’s party in a cabin in the woods.  J. is a good friend.  She is smart, logical, sensible and yet just as neurotic as I am (well maybe not).  We talk about how much our lives have mirrored each other’s while she moved from state to state or country to country and I lived in the same pink bedroom for 18 years.    I’m so glad she stayed for that last semester.  I’m so glad she couldn’t find an apartment or dorm room for those few months.  I’m so glad we are friends.  And I love her couch or air mattress in her tiny cross-country apartments.  She’s an anchor in my life, a friend who will always be there and never feel that far away no matter the actual distance.         "
"        Restaurants are closing or are closed by now.  It’s late, but you’re hungry.  You’re not sure you want to cook, but you really want a salad.  Drive to Ukrop’s on your way home.  Rifle through your dashboard CDs looking for Emmylou Harris.  You need Emmylou’s mellow voice to match your mellow mood.  She’s not there, but you’re happy you find Johnathan Rice.  Put it in the CD slot.  The volume is louder than you expect but you don’t change it realizing “Quiet Hushed Voices” is what you were really craving.  Sing along to it with the sunroof open.  Don’t mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows.  Keep singing the words.  Park, knowing you are only pausing the moment.  Enter the automatic doors.  Pick up romaine lettuce and chevre.  A salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire; you grab it, and hummus, for snacking.  Check yourself out in the self-serve lane.  Get back in the car.  Turn the key and hit the sunroof button.  Keep the duet with Johnathan going.  Feel your brother’s bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door.  This is good music.  Know that you can’t go home.  You want to drive and listen and feel the wind.  There are no mountains here, no country roads just 5 minutes away.  There is the highway.  Head toward home, but pass it.  Make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work.  Bare left this time.  Take the toll road, the Downtown Expressway.  You need a hit from the city buildings; the skyline up close and 50¢ is worth it.  Pass Rosewood and the U of R Stadium.  Put Johnathan on repeat.  Slow at the toll booth until the SmartTag signals a green light to keep going.  Speed up, a horse out of the gate.  Get the center lane.  Pass VCU and the Cherry St. overpass.  Pass the 2nd St. exit and Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol building.  Go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel.  Emerge to the buildings of downtown Richmond.  Wonder why so many lights are on.  Follow the signs to 95 North and 64 West, Washington and Charlottesville.  Curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings.  Look out the window, to the left, at the taller lit buildings.  {I want to love this city.}  Be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete.  See the clock tower of the renovated Main St. train station on the right side, you can almost touch it.  Sing with Johnathan.  Get off at the Broad St. exit.  Go quickly through Shockoe Bottom.  Remember the recent attacks here.  Get back to 95 going South this time to Petersburg.  Stay in the right hand lane, curve right at exit 73C toward the Powhite.  Imagine you are not driving but are suspended, floating through these buildings, under the highway above you.  Look through the windows of La Difference.  Wish you understood the difference.  Go back through the tunnel of lights.  Pass the Jefferson Hotel and the Governor’s Mansion.  {I want to love this city’s history.}  Pass the exit for the Boulevard.  Quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside Virginia’s museums and with a balcony.  Go on to Cary St.  Go to your home.  Park and walk to your building.  With the full moon behind say quietly and to no one 'I want to love this city.'  Unlock you door.  Put down your bags.  Wash you hands.  Decide it’s too late for salmon.  Get a large bowl out.  Pour the salad into it.  Begin to toast pecans from the freezer.  Crumble the chevre over the lettuce.  Pour on your homemade balsamic dressing.  Add the toasted pecans.  Take a bite as you walk to the living room, to your computer.  Realize you are a good cook, that this salad should be on menus.  Sit down at your laptop.  Put Johnathan on again.  Listen to him, and write this.         "

"       I’m sitting at the Getty along a path to the side of one of the buildings.  I’m in the shade and leaning against the structure’s massive stonewall.  I’m on a pathway to a terrace though it’s a path that is almost hidden.  People have to navigate around me as they walk through.  I wish they’d go away and leave this public space private, for me only.  I can see a vast view of LA from where I sit from the hills to the oceans.  Ahead and slightly to the right is a small clump of tall buildings that make up downtown.  Beverly Hills is just below me.  There is a fire billowing on a mountain a few miles away.  It’s in Santa Clarita a passerby says.  The smoke won’t reach LA because the winds blow toward the east, toward the mountains.  It looks both ominous and soft, like a cloud.  To the left and over the hills from the Getty is the Valley and Pasadena, though I can’t see them I know they are there with clichéd houses and perfect lawns.  There is smog that hangs in the air between the landscape and the sky, a visible reminder of this cities population.  To my right, if I careen around I can see the sea and Catalina Island poking its head just above the haze.  The 405 are below me and the traffic crawls from north and south.  Planes line up in the sky ahead, waiting to land at LAX.  This city is huge, a massive gallimaufry of rich and poor, everyday and famous.  The rich build houses on the mountains or even cliffs, ignoring the impending possibility of earthquakes.  They look like cracker or thin wafers that could tumble down like rocks sliding.  California has it’s own style to everything, but the houses in LA interest me the most.  Their style is a mix of Mediterranean, Spanish, and American classic.  The rich, modern houses are minimalist with hard lines and lots of glass, but mostly there is stucco, tan and smooth.  It is the red brick of southern California.    The Getty is an amazing place.  , a free art museum, open to the public.  But, people don’t usually come for the art; they come to see the Getty.  It is a vast structure of buildings placed on a hillside overlooking all this city has to offer.  It is made of an off-white stone creating straight lines and curved walls.  The landscaping is immense, green, and perfect.  Fountains pop up in many places, an offering of serenity.  The buildings are so large that looking back on them from on of the many terraces and seeing people walking around on the balconies and inside through the glass, they look like tiny bugs, like insignificant, unimportant things.  People stand against the railings where I sit.  They squint and point trying to comprehend what they see.  The wind is strong at times on this hill.  They sun beats down an arid hotness, but in the shade of the building, a chill awaits.         "
"       Happy Birthday A.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What to say about A.?  Only she will know what the title of this post means.  She is a dear college friend whom I lived with for 4 years, 4 crazy party filled and chilled out years.  When I first met her I didn’t think I liked her because she is so honest that it can be abrupt at times.  Then, her roommate went home for an extended time due to illness and A. and I became good friends and I saw her kinder, gentler side.  I ended up staying in her roommates bed quite often because my roommate was a freak of nature and I just needed to get away even if it was across the hall.  I’m so glad we became friends and that she is in my life.    A.  is the kind of friend who is there for you no matter what.  She’ll be there to help you move in to your new apartment or celebrate you graduation a year after she celebrated her own.  She is honest and doesn’t judge.  When confronted with people who are quite strange she says, “it takes all kinds to make the world go round.”  We use to rag her in college because the words “my mommy says” preceded almost every piece of factual or advice laden talk.  Well, her mommy did a great job.  She is a great girl and a good friend.    She married a few years ago.  He is a boy who counteracts all that we college friends thought she was.  He is country and mild mannered and loves hunting and listens to country music and watches racing.  A. was a bit wild in college so when we found out her choice we were a little confused.  It turns out that the domesticated life filled with good cooking and family all around is really her true self.  Her in-laws love her as much as we do and she has found a niche for herself and her husband.  They are beginning to build a house on 20 acres of land in the country soon.  I tell her that as soon as she puts a pool in I’ll be there.  I bow to A. and P. land on this auspicious day and bid you a good one.  May tiny pictures from walmart decorate the halls.   Happy Birthday,    ~ Azafata.         "

"       with another city.  I never thought I would like Los Angeles.  Never.  I thought I was an East Coast girl through and through.  Turns out, I could go either way.  Los Angeles isn’t anything I thought it would be.  It wasn’t as flashy as I had imagined.  It didn’t seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe it’s because travel is a carefree existence or maybe it’s because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isn’t the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didn’t believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldn’t fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least it’s a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home I’ll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I don’t want that to happen.  I’d rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.         "
"       Lots of things to say, but I'm tired and trying to get back to east coast time.  I love and miss LA.  It changed me.  I'll tell ya all about it later.  Time to watch movies and relax.         "
"       I’m off to LA for fun in the sun with my best friend.  It’s the last of a girl’s romp before she (you guessed it) gets married.  I plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal.  I miss her and I’ll miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens.  I was hoping we’d hop over to Vegas for the weekend, but we’ve opted for time in LA with her fiancé.  Well, I love them both, loads and loads.  I’m excited to see them, either in a flashy city or just in their living room.  Have to say though, kinda wish I was going to see a booby show.  I’ll blog at ya next week.  Blogger back ya’ll.         "
"       We at mind the gap are a happy and loving lot.  We like diversity and we like to celebrate with our friends when they have things to celebrate.  Today is such a day!  Today is Bastille Day in France, a day of celebrating the end of monarchal rule.  And so, in honor of our French friends, a list of things we love from France, or things that France pimped out to us.  • the Statue of Liberty  • le baguette (yummy) • the colors of the French flag  • fashion  • le croissant (even yummier)  • Dijon mustard • Champagne  • Cannes Film Festival • toy dogs (because the French took them everywhere long before Paris Hilton was born) • Jaques Costeau • Les Mis (though in French it would be lost on me) • Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and the wild boy of Aveyron • Matisse, Degas, La Tour, Cezanne, Monet, Rodin, Renior, to name a few • Joan of Arc • “Let them eat cake.”  This list does not endorse the loving of all things French because those French bastards didn’t go to Iraq with us so we said the hell with you too.  Our amazing and welcoming country forgot that French troops helped us in the American Revolution and about the gift that France once bestowed on us, the Statue of Liberty, and said, 'We’ll call French fries, Freedom fries instead,' ignoring the fact that French fries are actually from Belgium.  “Ha, take that you French bastards,” our government said.  Well, those French bastards were pretty spot on and had a sense that Bush was blowin’ smoke about weapons of mass of nothin’.  Damn those French bastards!  Happy Bastille Day everyone!         "
"       The Shakers say it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free.  “Simple Gifts” is an old shaker song written in 1848 and it is one of my favorites.  It is a song about simplicity, but it also says that “when we find ourselves in the place just right, we will be in the house of love and delight.”  While the house of love and delight sounds like a cheesy, incense burning, hippy joint, the sentiment is what gets me.  I like the idea that when we are true to ourselves we will find the simplicity of life which ultimately brings peace.    But it’s not always so such a simple gift.  We are all given gifts to some degree.  We are can run companies, we can cook amazing food, we can play an instrument, we can balance budgets, we grow a garden, we can teach someone to read, we can diagnosis symptoms, we can write, we can act, or we can see the world differently through the lens of a camera.  We all have talents and gifts which should be a part of our everyday lives.  The act of doing what you are good at, what you are talented in, is itself simplicity and freedom.    My cousin B. is an amazing photographer.  She has an eye like no one I’ve seen.  She loves taking pictures of things like rust and wood.  She can take scenery and portraits, but these are not her specialty.  Those shots are easy and generic, anyone can do them.  The passion she sees through her lens are things we would easily pass over.  B. hones in on the things that we feel corrode of corrupt surfaces.  Somehow, B. finds the beauty in them and she shows rust and corrosion as art.  And she does it so well.     She has never sold a photograph and has pretty much stopped taking pictures creatively when she left college.  All because the cost of taking and developing pictures is too much for her budget.  I’m saddened by this and I tell her often that she has to start taking pictures again, that she has to use her gift.  It is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free and sometimes we have to fight to use those gifts.  If our favorite writers and actors and doctors and teachers didn’t use their gifts, where would we be?  How many times has your life been changed by someone else’s gift?  I know that B. is scared and I understand it.  Putting your creative self out for the world to reject is a terrifying thing.  But that simple Shaker song says that  “When true simplicity is gain'd, To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd, To turn, turn will be our delight, Till by turning, turning we come round right”  So bow and bend B., simply use your gift, you’ll turn round right.

"       Numero dos is done.  Two weddings down, three to go.   The other day I received yet another wedding invitation.  As I perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope I wondered, “Who the hell is getting married now?”  I thought I was aware of all the weddings for this season.  Apparently now, but I was relieved to find out it is a second cousin.  I’m not close to her, so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit.  It would actually be fine if I didn’t make it to this one.  But, it is in Florida in September.  Either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season.  I don’t know if I’ll go.  It would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which, let’s face it, I do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit, often.  I am; however, quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations.  She’s in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe.  Tonight was a great wedding.  The drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset.  There were people I’ve never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and pre-parties.  There were good friends and new friends and family.  And there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love, lots of love all around.   Starting at 3pm in a Catholic Church, I nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit.  Our row, full of teachers, was the official peanut gallery.  We could hear and eye everything from out backseats, the late comers, the whispers, the crying children, the brat child telling her mother to “shush,” we saw it all and yet WE kept quiet.     Not being Catholic, we were worried that this would be what my Dad likes to call and “aerobics class” service.  You know, up down, up down, kneel, up down, kneel, etc.  But, my good friend L. and C. decided on a Catholic light service since they too are Catholic light, if anything. The wedding was short and pretty with well-chosen songs and readings. The parish was beautiful.  I always love big, cathedral parishes; they almost make me want to be Catholic.      I go to so many weddings that I could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart, but this wedding did not bore me and when L. walked down the isle with tears in her eyes I kinda welled up myself.  I’m not a crier at weddings.  In fact, I thought for a long time that I had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings.  Everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling Kleenex wrapped about their bouquets.  I’ve never needed a Kleenex at a wedding and have always though “Yeah, it’s a wedding, what’s the fuss, why are you crying?”  But, today, for L., I understood a little more.  She’s almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects.  He’s not a perfect man, but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him.  And when I saw her crying, walking with her father, I thought of myself and if I ever find that man I’m sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as I walk toward him too.    Cheers to L. and C., may you live happily ever after!         "
"       So I haven’t been great at blogging lately, especially since I returned from vacation.  I even wrote those beach ones on vacation when I was up late at night and bored.  But, now back at home there are things to distract me.  I should be writing all day since I have no job, but I picked up a few kids to consult on and tutor so that takes up a few hours a week and then well, today, I’m just procrastinating.  I have my final paper due for a class that finished on Tuesday night.  The paper was actually due Tuesday, but she gave us an extension and I took it.  I am the worst procrastinator.  I will put things off until it is 2 hours to deadline, but this stress is really what gets my creativity and productivity going.  I’ve tried to be diligent and work on things early and it is so lackluster that it seems a waste of time.  I’ve tried to put my own deadlines on things to make me work on it and then go play, but no, again, I don’t fall for my own tricks.  So, today, I probably should have turned it in sometime this morning, but she didn’t give us a time and so I haven’t started.  But, now, now I’m getting ready to start.  It should only take two hours or so, unless I read some blogs, or turn on the TV, or have to call that friend back, or have to find that CD that’s been missing for 3 months because only THAT CD will make me productive.  Anyway, off to work on it, *wink*.         "
"       I met him two weeks ago before I went to the beach.  I’ve been thinking about him ever since and am so happy when I see him.  He lights up my face and makes me feel like I have the best life in the world.  He is amazing.  I’ve even met his family and they are amazing.  He has a brother and sister and his dad his handsome and his mother is kind.  They are calm and centered and welcoming.  On Monday, his mother gave me five ears of corn, just because.    This boy is undescribable.  It doesn’t matter what I write because you can’t possibly get the full scope of him.  He has wisps of blond hair and blue eyes and when he says my name I melt.  His personality shines even when he is in a different room.  He is sweet and cuddly and playful and so much fun.  And the reason that he lights up my day and makes me want to appreciate everything that I have is because he can’t walk because of a tumor on his spine and he has cancer and Downs Syndrome and he’s four years old.  He deserves to live until he is 80 years old with a life filled with happiness and productivity and good people all around him.  He deserves so much this little one, this boy that I met.         "
"       Morehead City, NC.  On the Bogue Sound.  When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You can’t believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye can’t see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You don’t understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolina’s crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isn’t important, it’s the beach the matters.  It’s the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  It’s suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  It’s a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  It’s beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  It’s the day’s catch on the pier or at the surf.  It’s floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  It’s rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  It’s enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  It’s the oldies station on the radio and it’s your family all around.  It’s the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesn’t ever want to leave.           "
"       A rental for a week for your family, but a house to someone else.  The evidence of the family who owns the house is all around.  The selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall, a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room, pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house, artwork from local artists, and the choice of curtains that don’t match the furniture.  You enter a rental house like you enter a hotel.  You know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it “our beach house.”    There have been houses that don’t lock things away.  The fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it.  So, you’re father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it.  It’s too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him.  Your whole family is a bit embarrassed, but your mother’s friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit.  Still, too bad about ole granddad.  There are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you.  They leave out a guest book and brochures about the area.  You glance at them.  There have been visitors from as far away as Ohio or as close by as New Bern.  Your brother calls the travelers from New Jersey and New York Yankees.  You call them Yankees too, but not out loud.  They tell stories of their weeks, how much their family loved the house, the good weather they were fortunate to have, and they note their favorite restaurants.  You wonder why they choose to write what they write.  The guest book is quaint, but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board, now you can start your vacation.    Exploring the house, you can’t believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet.  The coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property.  There are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again, but then you think that the owner’s expect these things; beach houses are for children too.  You wonder how all the house was stocked.  Did the owner’s really like the dark, dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale?  Did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen?  Your family discusses the flaws in the house, in the decorations.  They have ideas on how to make it better, what to paint or how to arrange the furniture.  You are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses.  Oh yeah, they don’t have beach houses.  No one is amused.    Some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury.  You do a million loads in one week, more than if you were at home and partly just because you can.  You go home with clean clothes; this you realize is quite nice.  Other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided.  You feel a bit pampered by this, but you’d rather have the washer and dryer back.      There are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold.  There are houses where your family breaks the AC and has to have the unit replaced midweek.  You are again a bit embarrassed, but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place.  Then there are houses with no air conditioning at all, just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes.  These are your favorites.  These remind you of camping in childhood.  This is what the beach feels like to you, heat cut by cool breezes off the water.  Days when there is no breeze you thank God for the invention of ceiling fans.  It takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze, but when you do, you don’t ever want air conditioning at the beach again.  You sleep in little clothing and one sheet, you like the simplicity of this type of house.    In your mind you are always building the perfect beach house.  It is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family.  It is not new, it is old and well worn, and there is a lot of wood.  The oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements.  There are rocking chairs and a hammock.  There is a table for eating and playing cards.  A walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off.  The house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor.  Upstairs, at ocean view and deck level, there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space.  There are many large windows.  The dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company.  You want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it.  Couches in the living room turn into beds.  There is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck.  Oldies beach music is always on.  Every bedroom has a well-made ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night.  There are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage, waiting for the sand.  They are wooden with cloth backs.  There are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball.  The house is always full of people.         "
"       They wake up early in the morning to play together.  They are little girls with smocked dresses and bows in their hair.  They run around with high-pitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought, to the beach, to a family vacation.    Little girl cousins are a special thing.  They are automatic playmates and best friends.  They share genes and are beginning to share their lives, their growing up.  They clamor to the beach with all their might, they play in the sand for hours, filling buckets, dragging water from the surf, and hunting for shells.  They are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block.  Their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves.  The tidal pools are a perfect depth.  Rafts are their best toys, but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater.  They get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness, the stickiness.  They don’t want to go into the house even after hours of playing, but they love to rinse off with the hose, a semi grown up shower for a little girl.    Watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach, at Salter Path Family campground, on the Bogue Sound.  Your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging.  You and your cousins where obsessed with shells.  You hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island.  At the end of the shell hunts, you surveyed your treasurer.  You memorized the shapes and names, the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes.  It is years later that you realize, browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers, sisters.  The next morning, you woke up early to set up shop.  You took boxes your mothers had packed in, turned them upside down, and laid old towels on top.  You set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground.  You sold seashells by the sound.  You were thrilled with every purchase.  After a few days of selling, you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road.  You were amazed with the polished shells.  You bought cleaned sand dollars and gold-rimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets.    Your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home.  You don’t need them around you anymore, but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing, you wish for the days at Salter Path, for the shelling and sound.  You wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older.           "

"       “ urlLink Stuart Weitzman  .  OhMyGod we have to go in.  They’re having a sale.”  I say to K.    Poor K has no idea what or who Stuart Weitzman is. “Sure,” she says and we enter.  The store on Rodeo is small yet two salespeople greet us at the door.  They actually talk to us and welcome us and tell us about the sale.  We have just come out of Ralph Lauren across the street where I found, but did not buy, a pair of purple leather mules on sale for half price at $495.  I knew Stuart could be much more affordable in department stores, but I expect the Rodeo store to have sales where shoes were still $200- $300.  I am wrong.  Every shoe on the sales rack is $75.  “Hot damn,” I think “I just might buy something on Rodeo Drive, baby.”    K and I try on several pairs.  I find some fabulous black satin high heels with an impossibly cute bow covering the toe.  K finds some strappy white heels that she considers for her wedding day.  We each buy nothing, coming back to the reality that even at $75 a pair; we don’t live a Stuart Weitzman life.  We leave, the salespeople shockingly bidding us a good day.  We are tired by this 2nd hour on Rodeo.  We have seen José Eber outside his salon, a woman clutching her toy dog in  urlLink Chanel , huge canary diamonds at  urlLink Van Cleef & Arpels , a rail thin blond model standing as a bored yet beautiful greeter at  urlLink Dior , and the back, private entrances to  urlLink Armani  and  urlLink Gucci .  We are heading toward the car, parked in the sun in a free space in front of someone’s small bungalow and perfectly manicured green lawn.  I am thirsty, having downed my bottle of water noisily in Gucci while walking among the fur trimmed dog beds covered in Gs.    We think we were done with the pseudo shopping and the mouth gaping staring and then all of sudden we walk across Plexiglas ovals in the sidewalk.  Below the “windows” were human size ant holes with manikins ironing or just posing.  There are three of them, two girls, one boy.  “What the hell,” I think.  K and I look above us and there is no sign, just a massive metallic rectangle as big as a Mack truck above us.  People are milling about in the opening to this, store?  The entrance is set back and it is all open, there are no doors, but there are two huge human sculptures with no heads resting just under the ceiling.  They seem to be holding up the second floor yet they don’t quite touch it.  K and I walk in, we don’t know what else to do, we are transfixed.     Inside there are concrete walls and before us a massive staircase that spans across the room leaving narrow “halls” along either side.  We walked down the left side and set into the wall there seems to be a concierge of sorts, a young brunette manning a phone.  “Is this a hotel?” I think.  Just past the concierge’s window there are low tables and set into the concrete walls are lit shelves at hip level.  Things are strewn about.  Bags, shoes, just stuff covering everything, but with no sense of order.  I look closely at one of the bags and see the distinguishable triangle with the word PRADA.  I turn, “K, we’re in  urlLink Prada ,” I gasp, my face looking quizzical and amazed at the same time.  K doesn’t say anything.  We keep walking.  We come around to the back of the room and there is another set of stairs mirroring the ones in the front yet opposite so that the staircases make a large triangle in the room.  We decide to go up, but have to navigate around shoes and the legs of manikins with no torso.  “What the hell,” keeps running through my brain.     At the top of the stairs we turn left and enter a room that runs like small hallways just above the space below so that on the right and left are narrow halls and in the front and back are slightly wider rooms over the stairs.  The walls are green and look like swiss cheese.  But, there are no smooth surfaces on the walls.  There are only holes.  I don’t understand it and I follow K’s hand to the wall.  It’s plastic, green plastic swiss cheese, “What the hell?”    The rooms are created with the swiss cheese walls on one side and glass on the other to keep you from falling down the stairs.  There are metal racks of clothes along the swiss cheese walls with exactly 5 items on each.  Thin, tan, bleach highlighted men in black walk around carrying an item or two.  They are barely noticeable in this room, the fade, into the…air.  When we turn the corner and hit the larger front room I spy the dressing rooms on the right side, above the stairs, I see two little girls playing inside, through the glass.  I think, “I know Prada is weird, but who tries on clothes behind glass, in front of strangers?”  Then, one of the girls hits something on the wall and the glass goes frosted.  “What.  The.  Hell?”    After I touch some $1500 mini skirts, we leave.  K and I don’t understand what we have just seen.  Was it real?  It will be the topic of many conversations with K’s fiancé that week and it will be the first story I tell friends when they ask about L.A.  I’ll say, “I’m going to tell you about Prada, but you won’t understand.”  And when I’m done telling them about the swiss cheese walls and the frosted glass they’ll say things like “Weird,” or “Are you kidding?”  And I’ll tell them that “yes, it sounds weird, but you still don’t understand.  You really have to go.  You have to experience it.  Go to Prada on Rodeo.  It’s worth the plane ride.”         "
"       I used to collect quotations.  I’d culled them from quotation books or magazines or friends or even the daily email from Oprah’s website.  I’d write them in a flowery printed journal in my best handwriting.  I wanted to the believe the lines like “Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow,”  but, Helen Keller never saw a shadow though she lived within one.  I wanted her words to show my how to not only look at the sunshine, but surpass it and become it.  She did, why couldn’t I?    For years my favorite quote was “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”  When I found it I thought Oscar Wilde was my soul mate, that he understood my plight.  I even wrote it in fancy scrawl across a painted wooden board that held a curtain rod and hung it over 2 different bedroom windows.  But, looking at the stars does nothing for trying to reach them and if you don’t come out in the daylight, the gutter must be a hot and miserable place.  “You must do the thing you think you cannot do,” wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and she was right.  You must in fact do the thing you think you cannot do.  She was strong and brave and I trusted her words.  She was the original Nike slogan, “Just do it.”  These words pulled me through many papers and exams in college, but nothing, nothing in college or life could prepare me for what lay ahead.  My first years teaching I was energetic and naïve and ready to take on the world.  I loved what I did and felt absolutely called to do it.  I thought that my teaching kids with autism was who I was.  I thought it defined me and that everyone should revere me for the work I did.  Those first years threw me into a tailspin of hatred and anger and bitterness and disappointment and fear and illness.  I complained constantly and to anyone who would listen, but friendships and life were slipping away.  Quotations and words of wisdom wouldn’t pull me through and there were many nights I just cried and prayed.    I finally sought help and through a counselor learned that my life was full of unhealthy patterns and that I was the only one in control of what could happen in my life.  I didn’t believe her and for 3 years cried and complained about all the things that happened TO me.  Then I began to use her advice and let the control go.  I had to learn to let go and forgive.  I had to learn to let life take me where it would.  I had to learn to do the thing I thought I could not do.  I faced the shadows and the gutters and I’m still learning to leave them where they are, in the past.  You can’t see the sunshine or stars clearly until you face their opposites.  And no one and no quotation will help you truly get there.  They can point the way, but you, you have to do the digging and nail biting eye to eye combat with all the bad things before you finally appreciate all the good ones and let happiness if not land, at least aim, at your doorstep, everyday.

"           In September of 1996, I was backpacking through Israel when I landed in the northern hill town of Tzfat (AKA Safed).  Tzfat is the epicenter of Jewish mysticism and has become a...wait for it...Mecca for people interested in living a thoroughly Jewish life, complete with exhaustive ritual and worship, but with a focus on the more esoteric teachings of  urlLink Kabbalah , rather than the more literal Judaism prevelent in Jerusalem.  Often, people arrive in Tzfat wanting to merely dabble, but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives.  For lodging I stayed at a hostel run by an Orthodox Jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day.  It's no secret that many Jewish tourists traveling around Israel have a sometimes hidden (sometimes not) agenda to have some kind of religious or spiritual experience while in the Holy Land, especially Jews from the U.S. where spirituality is mostly marginalized.  After all, when you return from a trip to Israel, you will invariably be asked by many people whether or not anything happened, and by the way the question is formed, you know they're not asking whether or not you got sick from eating too many dates.    In Tzfat, something happened, but I've only recently figured out what it was.  I had already been through Jerusalem and had prayed at the holiest Jewish site in the world, the  urlLink Western Wall , the remnants of the Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in 68 C.E.  While it was indeed an incredible place to visit, and while I did feel the weight of history and the echoes of millions of prayers thick in the air, I came away feeling like something was missing, as if I was supposed to have had a catharsis or awakening.  Indeed, nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit.  And so I came to Tzfat a bit let down, but not without hope that I'd pick up something of spiritual value.  It was in that spirit that I attended a morning class with a Rabbi whose name, sadly, never stuck with me.    We spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the Book of Genesis.  Well, at least the Rabbi tried to contain the discussion to the first line, quoting commentary written over hundreds of years, analyzing every word in that first sentence.  Every word, of course, had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with translating from Hebrew.  So, I thought this level of scrutiny was a green light for me to ask a question about the rest of the creation story, a question that had bugged me for years.   hjm: Rabbi, do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in 6 days?  Six days as we know them now?  Six twenty-four hour days?  Rabbi: Yes, I do.    hjm: What about modern interpretations that suggest the possibility that each of those 6 days actually lasted millions of years?  Rabbi: No. They were twenty-four hour days, just as we experience them today.  hjm: So, you actually believe that is has only been 5,755 years since heaven and earth were created.  Rabbi: Yes.  hjm: What about science?  What about carbon date testing that shows fossils to be millions of years old?  Rabbi:  Scientists believe what they want to believe, and I believe what I want to believe.   On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about this Rabbi.  He wore the traditional black and white clothes, his hair and beard were characteristically unkempt, he was probably not that much older than me, but he'd forgotten more about Judaism than I had ever learned.  In hindsight, what I realize now as significant was the utter sincerity, the quiet conviction, the peacefulness he exuded, comforted by his faith and under no pressure whatsoever to justify it to anyone.  Sure, he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith.  Yet, he had no desire to force his views on anyone.    So, it strikes me how different he was from other people I have met who profess a deep, passionate faith.  It has been my misfortune to have more than once been confronted by religious zealotry, an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation.  The zealot seems driven more by desperation than anything else.  They have seen the light and operate from a place of panic, feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others.    For years after my trip, I liked to tell the story about that Rabbi, and it is with some degree of shame that I realize that I actually took delight in pointing out what, until now, seemed like the worst kind of blind faith, the shunning of fundamental scientific discoveries in favor of a literal interpretation of a document, The Bible, that scientists and scholars have made few solid conclusions about.  I got a lot of mileage with that anecdote and missed the point completely.  In the end, it was more important that the Rabbi was benevolent than whether or not he was right about the origins of the universe.  One can have all the faith in the world, but if he/she does not practice tolerance towards fellow humans who have their own version of faith, if they are motivated by desperation rather than love, then not only are they are in no position to be prosletyzing, but they are hardly models of an enlightened being, totally incapable of demonstrating the benefits of faith.

"           Josh Marshall made a  urlLink  post   to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe. He talks about the tone of the Democratic National Convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination.  Much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the DNC has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the Bush Administration, and Josh offers his explanation in two points:   First:   On the surface, the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at President Bush. And to some degree of course they were. But the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from Democrats' antipathy for President Bush as from a pitched battle, almost a rebellion, within the Democratic party -- the grassroots of the Democratic party insisting that Washington Democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board. Fiery rhetoric against President Bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him. In other words, it was to a very real degree aimed at other Democrats.    Second:   Anger is often, and rage is almost always, an emotion rooted in powerlessness. That was certainly the position of Democrats in early 2003 (on so many levels), though less so as the year went on. These Democrats don't feel powerless. The mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office, that the wind is at their backs.   So, Josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism.  That certainly is a glass-half-full way to interpret it.  Yet, while I'd rather be optimistic, the polls showing Bush and Kerry in a dead heat, despite the glaring fact that the Bush Administration has dragged this country through the gutter, erode my ability to believe that the Democratic Party has what it takes to beat the Republicans.  What Josh sees as a new found confidence, I see as fearful, tip-toe dancing around the swing voters.    The point that anger is 'almost always' rooted in powerlessness, while likely true, rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence, righteous indignation, that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice.  As a model, I look to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  MLK spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism.  He had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed.  I find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in America are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation.  It is a classic American icon, yet somewhere along the line the Democratic Party decided that this formula doesn't work.  Yes, the media jumped all over Howard Dean for his post-Iowa pep rally.  The key, however, was how the Dean campaign, and the Democrats in general, reacted.  Rather than defend the emotion that Dean was showing, which I contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger, they apologized and toned it down.  This is classic pacification, and the worst part is that it is self-inflicted.           "
"              urlLink The New York Times > Week in Review > What Boston Can Do for Kerry : 'Yet for all that, the American convention remains a singular moment in the nominating process - a relic of a bygone time, perhaps, but a relic that nonetheless keeps driving the story line of a presidential election. And that is no small matter for John Kerry, the likely Democratic nominee.  Mr. Kerry will head to Boston - where the convention begins next Monday - remembering and trying to duplicate Mr. Clinton's success. Americans do not seem overly enthused about him. If polls showing him tied with Mr. Bush are to be believed,  Mr. Kerry has so far been unable to take advantage of abundant evidence that Americans are looking for a change in the White House.   Mr. Kerry's advisers say that it is not that voters don't like him; it is that they still do not know him, even after $80 million worth of television advertisements, close to 50 candidate debates and almost two years of campaigning. Yet Mr. Kerry's aides see these polls, and are clearly hungering for these four days in Boston to break this deadlock, preparing with a level of intensity and detail that serves as the ultimate validation of the power of conventions.'  This year, the Democratic National Convention is taking place merely for Big Dems to glad hand one another and for some Little Dem wannabes to wait for the party to collapse.   What is emphasized above I stated was Kerry's electability problem back in February/March (not here but elsewhere as t-floss hadn't been around then). Back then I was even leaning to voting for Bush if the Democratic National Party allowed the early primaries to elect a candidate who may have been winning the party faithful but had no chance of winning over the Democratic population at large. Sooner or later (with Kerry it may very well be later), the Dems need to wake up and realize they are flailing about in an identity crisis. That they have allowed themselves to become Republicans in dress and Democrats in name only is shameful. The Democratic Party needs an overhaul. Badly. Gore losing to Bush was plenty evidence. How many more Senators must they run out there to be slaughtered?  As many others opine, Americans do recognize that Bush has his failings, but many of those same Americans look at Kerry and wonder. And think, ummm, that's a haggard Al Gore with a big coif. The insincerity meter runs high around Kerry in comparison to Bush. And that meter often sways elections (no, really, it does!). Bush may be a word-fumbling dolt on stage but he's a sincere word-fumbling dolt on and off stage. Voters who have doubts will go for the sincere incumbent every time no matter how much he bungled things.   Kerry? Unlike rabble-rouser Howard Dean and his yyyyyyyyahp!ing, which in the long run  would  have been a positive, Kerry has said and done nothing to convince those 'looking for a change' to look his way.    It has been 52 years since a convention really chose the candidate - when Democrats in Chicago nominated Adlai Stevenson. Over the next 40 years, conventions became the stage for presenting a running mate, as a way of keeping some interest in the event. Even that little gift of news has slipped away over the years; Mr. Kerry selected Mr. Edwards three weeks before the convention. Granted, the conventions are more about rallying and grooming but never (?) before were the early primary returns allowed to run roughshod over the entire primary process. The West Coast complains about early returns on the East Coast affecting elections, well, what about primaries?!   Thankfully, Edwards was named to the ticket. If it wasn't for him, I'd be voting same as I did in 1976, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.   Don't expect the DNC to change that matter. That is unless the Big Dems wisely allow John Edward to run the show from here on out. He is capable of reaching those seeking change. He is positive and upbeat. Kerry is a reminder of the past. A reminder of the shell the Democratic Party has become. Edwards is the future. Stumping will return. Speechmaking will return. But the candidate must be earnest. He must not be afraid to make mistakes. Kerry? Copies GW's advertising and doesn't differentiate himself in the least. He wouldn't want to do something the focus groups don't approve. He's a deer in the headlights. Rather, a deer in the bed of the Grand Ol Party's hemi.   This is jek and I approved this blog.  P.S. Edwards/Kerry         "

I took real pleasure in reading about the sound ass-whoopin' the Bush administration received at a recent benefit concert that raised $7.5 million.   After celebrities raised $7.5 million with a concert for Democratic candidates John Kerry and John Edwards , an angry Bush campaign challenged their opponents on Friday to release a videotape showing performers calling the president a 'liar' and a 'cheap thug' during the show.  Actor Chevy Chase drew laughs and cheers from the Radio City Music Hall audience when he described politicians and their hobbies: 'Clinton plays the sax, John plays the guitar, and the president's a liar.' John Mellencamp sang 'Let me tell you a story about the Texas Bandito,' a tune that referred to Bush as a 'cheap thug.'  'If John Kerry is going to praise last night's star-studded hate fest and characterize it as the 'heart and soul' of America, he should share these values with voters everywhere,' Bush-Cheney campaign manager Ken Mehlman said Friday in a statement. 'We call on Kerry to release the video of this event so that all Americans can see what John Kerry has called America's 'heart and soul.''   The Bushies hate bullies.  Now  that's  funny!         "
"           Josh Marshall's got a  urlLink post  up today about news from Afghanistan concerning a mercenary of sorts who  '...was arrested with others for conducting a 'self-appointed counterterrorism mission that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet.''   Josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail, especially since it is very unclear who, if anyone, hired him.    His last paragraph reads:   It just seems like someone must have been paying this guy to do something, unless it's like a blog where you just set up shop and figure that someday a revenue stream might turn up.   Sure, I see the intended humor, but I find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison.    All in all, a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the ABCNEWS.com  urlLink page  it appears on.

"            urlLink Wilco  has another great album out ( urlLink A Ghost is Born ), there's a lead story on Wilco and Jeff Tweedy in  urlLink Rolling Stone , and still so few people, it seems, appreciate what Wilco has accomplished.    From their inception and through the masterpiece  urlLink Summerteeth  , Wilco were master chefs, taking ingredients from their myriad influences and whipping them up into the yummiest of delicacies.   Homage  is a word that often comes to mind when listening to Wilco, since the musical references are so overt that it is impossible to label them as rip-offs.    Yet, what is most remarkable about the band is what they have done in their last two albums -  urlLink Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  and now A Ghost is Born.  What we've seen, or perhaps more appropriately heard, has been the metamorphosis from a band of masterful interpreters of classic pop/rock/country music, to the creators of their very own, unique sound.  Yes, the influences are still there, but they are now relegated to background filler or the occasional, brief keyboard or guitar lick.    It will be very exciting to watch where they will go from here.         "
"           I don't know whether to be amused or disturbed by this  urlLink article  in Tuesday's (7/6/04) Washington Post.  On the surface it seems like a simple look at how silly things get in the world of domain names.  Six years ago, an Indianapolis bail bondsman, Kerry Edwards, created his own web domain -  urlLink www.kerryedwards.com .  According to the article, the day it was announced that Sen. John Edwards would be Kerry's running mate, Indianapolis Edwards was called by the Kerry campaign to discuss purchase of the domain name.  Apparently, the asking price was too high.  So, it seems like a fairly harmless, humorous human interest story.  Right?  Reading on we learn about other cybersquatters who have purchased domain names, hoping to cash in:   Other obvious choices for a campaign Web site – KerryEdwards04.com, KerryEdwards2004.com, KerryEdwards-2004.com and KerryEdwards2004.net – have already been registered, according to publicly available Internet records.   Yet, the disturbing part comes in this disclosure by one of these hopeful opportunists, Kevin Draftz of Chicago:   Draftz said his first choice of buyers is the Kerry campaign, but would not rule out selling them to the competition.   And we, or at least I, wonder what is wrong with democracy in America.    It's for sale.           "

"             Spare the Rod, Save the Child Missouri's youth prisons focus on small groups, therapy, caring. Officials in California's punishment-oriented system are taking a look.   By Jenifer Warren Times Staff Writer  July 1, 2004  ST. JOSEPH, Mo. — There are no handcuffs, no razor-wire fences, no uniforms, no cells. Missouri does things differently in its prisons for young people, and it shows — in what you see and what you don't.  Inmates, referred to as 'kids,' live in dorms that feature beanbag chairs, potted plants, stuffed animals and bunk beds with smiley-face comforters. Guards — who are called 'youth specialists' and must have college degrees — go by their first names and don't hesitate to offer hugs.  At the maximum-security lockup in St. Joseph, two cats, Midnight and Tigger, curl up on laps as the state's toughest teenage offenders explore the roots of their anger, weep over the acts of abusive parents and swap strategies for breaking free of gangs. At another facility in Kansas City, boys who rack up months of good behavior earn the right to attend summer basketball camp.  'The old corrections model was a failure; most kids left us worse off than when they came in,' said Mark Steward, the chief of Missouri's youth penal system. 'So we threw away that culture, and now we focus on treatment, on making connections with these guys and showing them another way…. It works.'    urlLink This  is a must read, but it requires free registration, sorry.         "
"           Very interesting  urlLink stuff  brewing in the African-American community.  Just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male, to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in America, Bill Cosby upsets the apple cart and says there's no excuse.   During Thursday's speech, Cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their 'dirty laundry.'   'Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n----r as they're walking up and down the street,' he said.   Cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in America. 'They think they're hip,' he said. 'They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.'   To African-American men, Cosby ranted, 'Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job.'   He complained about rap music: 'When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'n----r this' and 'n----r that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car--those children hear that. And I am telling you when you put the CD on and then you get up and dance to it What are you saying to your children?'   And he also ripped into sitcoms targeting African-American audiences: 'Comedians coming on TV [saying,] 'I am so ugly, you are ugly, yuck, yuck.' That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it.'   'I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'...and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk,' Cosby said in May. 'And then I heard the father talk...Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.'   On Thursday, Cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject, saying once again that white people aren't to blame for teen pregnancy and high-school dropout rates.   'For me there is a time...when we have to turn the mirror around,' he said. 'Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in.'    Easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man?  I don't know.  Does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure?  Could be.  Does what he say have value?  No doubt.  It is not 'Uncle Tom' to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed, to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational, sometimes self-destructive behavior and cultural trends.    It took guts for Cosby to take this stance and I'm glad Jesse Jackson is supporting him.            "
"           It's crap like  urlLink this  that gives hippies a bad name:   Rock musician David Crosby , founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, pleaded guilty Friday to a gun charge, was fined $5,000 and sentenced to a conditional discharge.  The singer was arrested March 6 at the DoubleTree Suites Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Police said they found a Colt .45-caliber handgun, three clips of .45-caliber ammunition and two knives in his luggage.  Police also said the musician had a plastic bag containing an ounce of marijuana, a wooden container with a marijuana cigarette in it, a package of cigarette rolling papers and two other plastic containers with marijuana residue.   What a shame.  All the lovely music he's made and the mass movement of love and peace that he was a part of is overshadowed by the ridiculous behavior of an old drug addict.  Way to go, Dave.

"           I have a new favorite website. The British newspaper  The Guardian  calls their site  urlLink   Guardian Unlimited   , which contains content beyond what they print on paper. Noteable for their news coverage from outside the American corporate media machine, but just as appealing for their British take on all things cultural, it's a great place to browse for information and entertainment.  The inspiration for this post came from reading two articles online today.   urlLink  Barred painter's open air nude show     urlLink  Naked women, cars and sports help doubles sales of mens mags    The irony, when these two pieces are juxtaposed, is so thick and delicious you can cut it with a knife and relish in licking the bowl.  Yet, what came to me when I read the second article is a much more serious issue - men being manipulated, mostly by other men. It never ceases to amaze me how transparent it all is. Dare watching commercial television for even a short while and you will be flooded with promises aimed at men that they will have more sex and more fun if they buy certain products or participate in certain activities.  Guys, wake up! Don't you see what's going on here? You are not that stupid. You are not Pavlovian dogs! Shouldn't you feel insulted, used, stereotyped? Doesn't it bother you that it's mostly men who are selling these products, trying to exploit for their own personal gain you, their fellow men and the fact that you have been conditioned to reflexively respond to images of scantily clad women, flashy cars, rich sports celebrities, etc.? Do you think they should be raking in the dough, living a life of luxury, while you shell out your hard earned cash on items you might not purchase if you thoroughly thought about the options available.  As an example and proof that I am in no way preaching a puritan lifestyle, let's look at beer.  Question: Why in the world would anyone mindlessly choose Budweiser, Miller, or Coors when they can be enjoying  urlLink  Boundary Bay  ,  urlLink  Pike  , or  urlLink  Fish Tail  ?  Answer: Boundary Bay, Pike, and Fish Tail will not use sexual or other manipulative imagery to sell their products. Oh yeah...and they actually taste good too.   (While some would argue that another main reason for choosing Bud, Miller, and Coors is that they are cheaper, I would respond that men could easily afford the more expensive brews if they weren't blowing so much money on all the other stuff they've been manipulated into buying.)   So, my fellow male Homo sapiens, rise above your caveman roots and join me in a toast, over a pint of Boundary Bay's Imperial Oatmeal Stout: To the liberation of all men from the Sirens-in-drag of modern advertising!

'I am not trying to justify what I did in any way; I am just saying this was the case, this is what I did and, hands up, I did it.'   Lombard, whose honesty is a historic first, expressed his sorrow and apologised to everyone in advance of the pending statement from the Athletics Association of Ireland.

Of course, if judgment of rules abuse by the IOC is handled like the NCAA handles its issues, then many athletes are unfairly punished when taking something as simple as aspirin or cough medicine. Still, I gotta admire this Irish lad for his admission of guilt. Granted, he only deserves admiration because many, many athletes have long been denying their use of illegal substances.

"           The key to moving towards  urlLink  energy independence   is to anticipate the knee-jerk reaction that the very powerful energy industry will have to any proposals that suggest a change to the status quo.  Listen, closely, you can almost hear them saying it now, 'This policy will put thousands and thousands of Americans out of work!'  No, actually, your pathetic, short-sighted management of your companies, not planning for the inevitable need to develop new energy resources to position your companies for success in the future, will put thousands and thousands out of work.    Ever have that argument with a free market capitalist who says that there is nothing wrong with 'big box' chain stores like The Home Depot coming to town and putting 'Mom & Pop' hardware stores out of business?  What's their biggest argument?  'If Mom & Pop can't get creative and figure out how to compete, then it's survival of the fittest.'    Any chance that this same free market capitalist would apply that same theory to, let's say, oil companies who claim that they will be put out of business by competing energy companies?    I didn't think so.  The truth is, regardless of how much environmentalists and anti-corporation activists despise the current energy industry, it makes no sense to propose policies that threaten these corporate giants.  If there is one thing that these companies are good at it's producing and distributing products to millions of consumers spread all over the globe.  Yes, production and distribution has been extremely destructive to the environment, but that is more a function of the toxic nature of the product than their business practices.    Kerry's plan, based on the scanty information available thus far, seems to understand the value of making the development of sustainable energy an attractive, money-making proposition for the energy industry.  Why reinvent the wheel when we can just make it a better wheel?  Will the energy companies still cry foul?  Yes, particularly because they are so financially and politically entangled in the Middle East.  However, given how badly it is going over there, while a U.S. President from an oil family presided over record-breaking gas prices, they may not have a leg to stand on.            "
"           So, I've finally come up for air. I'm taking too many breaths. I've got so much to do. So much to say. See in the last month -- off and on when not becoming a born again digital virgin (that's right, the technological kid has come in from the analog storm (storms are good every now and again)) -- I've been swimming through  urlLink content management systems ,  urlLink blogware  (again and sticking with  urlLink WordPress ) and  urlLink web standards .  Before posting a lot about which you may have no interest in reading (then please skim!), know that this is all gonna see the light of day (sorta) at t-floss when its appearance starts to shift.  urlLink Brand identity , baby! (If anybody knows the title of the book Tom Peters co-authored about branding, published circa 1980, please let me know. It was a fantastic book that doesn't contain all the awful self-help language he employs these days. The dark side of success. And branding. Everyone copies you and the parody makes the original laughable. Sorta. Anyway...)  There is a lot to web standards and  urlLink accessibility . No more do web developers have to write six different pages for six different browsers. Mainly, they need to focus on 5% of the web's users who use standards-compliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95%. Cough, Redmond, cough. Please make IE7  urlLink the best browser . :pray:  Anyway, thank gawd that the browser wars are (mostly) over. (Now, could we do something about our two-party political process! I'm all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same. Um, where was I?) That's right, back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when I took to the road, I tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph. Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read. Oh, but here's one funny, funny piece,  urlLink Gurus v. Bloggers 2  ( urlLink part one ), for those interested in the contradictions of 'practice what you preach'.

"           You know how it is.  It's 2 a.m. on a Saturday night.  Last call has come and gone.  Yes, there've been many identical nights like this one, out with friends sharing libations and that simple pleasure of camaraderie in our friendly neighborhood tavern.  Yet, to call these evenings ordinary was to overlook the priceless value they brought - the hours together, leaning on each other through the trials and tribulations of young adulthood, trying to make sense of all the pressures we felt from a world of parents and professors demanding a commitment to discipline, only sure about a few things - we liked each other, Rock & Roll music, cold beer in a cozy bar, and talking, as long as we could stay awake, about all our dreams.  Last call always came as a temporary let down until one of us casually said the inevitable, 'Who's hungry?'    There's a new film coming out called  urlLink   Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle   , described as a late night road movie, the adventures of two guys from New Jersey who get the munchies and are compelled to get to a  urlLink  White Castle   restaurant at all cost.  Being from New Jersey and having actually spent a few late nights in college making my way to and from White Castle, I couldn't hold off the rush of memories that came to me, though the more I read about the movie it is clear that, the similarities to my experiences notwithstanding, the film really has nothing to do with me and my friends.  Beyond the obvious, that the two protagonists are from Indian and Pakistani heritages respectively, while we were all white, middle class, mostly Jewish suburbanites, perhaps the clearest difference lies in the real reason for finding a late night eating establishment after closing down the bar.  It never was about the food.    A film that comes closer to what I remember would be Barry Levinson's  urlLink   Diner   .  A  urlLink  summary   of  Diner  from that website goes like this:  Set in 1959, Diner shows how five young men resist their adulthood and seek refuge in their beloved Diner. The mundane, childish, and titillating details of their lives are shared. But the golden moments pass, and the men shoulder their responsibilities, leaving the Diner behind.  In preparing this post, I emailed some of my old friends, asking them to share their memories of our precious late night gab sessions over food.  They'll hate this, but perhaps the years have caught up with them because their responses, more accurately a pathetic lack of responses, initially made me question my own rose-colored-glasses look backward.  One friend who still lives in New Jersey wrote that he remembers waking up in the morning feeling terrible from having eaten at a greasy spoon called  urlLink  The White Rose System  , popular for it's artery-hardening burgers and for being open 24 hours.  It's true that we always blamed the burgers for how awful we felt the next day, in total denial that alcohol might have had anything to do with it.    Still I hadn't gleaned what I hoped from the old gang, so I had to rely on my own recollections.  Fortunately, there are many fond moments and places to choose from - burger joints and pizza parlors after the bars, diners and Denny's after concerts in the city, dives from New Brunswick to Manhattan just shootin' the shit.  Perhaps the reason why I didn't get a better response from my friends has something to do with geographical distance.  Whereas we used to all live either together or within minutes of each other, we are now spread across the country, in New Jersey, Arizona, California, and Washington State.    Yeah, something tells me that if we were all together, sitting around a pizza pie and pitchers of beer, the stories would flood the place.  That's what it was always about.            "
"           A month ago I posted some  urlLink  commentary   on Bill Cosby's recent rants.  The Cos has been raising hell about how his fellow African-Americans, namely those living in poverty, are increasingly responsible for their lack of upward mobility.    As a follow-up, I highly recommend this excellent  urlLink  column   by none other than Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in the New York Times.  Gates draws on the Cosby comments as well as the now famous DNC speech of Barack Obama.  Here's a teaser:  Go into any inner-city neighborhood,' Barack Obama said in his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, 'and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.' In a speech filled with rousing applause lines, it was a line that many black Democratic delegates found especially galvanizing. Not just because they agreed, but because it was a home truth they'd seldom heard a politician say out loud.   Why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public, without being pilloried for 'blaming the victim'? Why the huge flap over Bill Cosby's insistence that black teenagers do their homework, stay in school, master standard English and stop having babies? Any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that Mr. Cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community.   (p.s. May this post serve as a not-so-subtle plug for the New York Times Online.  Yes it requires registration, but if there is any single publication worth going through the hassle of filling out and submitting a free registration form its this one.  If you don't like registering because you are worried about getting junk email, get a throwaway free Hotmail or Yahoo email account if you have to, but don't block yourself out of the Times for that reason alone.)

It is illegal here in Bellingham, but not everywhere.  I think your friend's just acting like he knows everything.  son: Yeah.  hjm: Don't you think it would be boring to know everything?  There would be no mystery to life.  son: Yeah, but it could be useful.  (pause, holding back a chuckle, followed by immense pride and adoration)  hjm: True.

"           so i love photography.  right now, in fact, i am waiting for a guy in washington to post his darkroom stuff on ebay, so i can snatch it up and have pretty much everything i need. we emailed and arranged it ahead of time.  is that right?  what are the ethics of ebay, anyway?  i dunno.  whatever.  all i know is i am excited for this whole thing to finally be within my grasp.   i have been pining over the lack of darkroom because of space, time, and/or money, for over two years.  The soft glow of the dim, red light, the faint smell of chemicals, the excitement of dropping the paper in the developer and watching an image appear, before my very eyes.   excellent.    i love the process of taking pictures and developing film and watching it all come together in my hands.  it's going to become more of an anomaly as the digital age trudges forth, but maybe that will make the old-fashioned stuff all the more special and interesting.  i'm not one to prefer convenience, generally, where artistic endeavors are concerned.  it took me a long time to be comfortable with even buying a digital camera for snapshots, because i was afraid convenience would override my desire to print my own pictures.  it hasn't!  (that's an interesting topic, by the way.  tell me what you prefer, people, and why!)  where is the guy?!? must go check again.....i've hit refresh on my internet browser and checked my email about a hundred times in the last hour......    ooh! he emailed me, saying he's posting it at 1pm!!!   where is it???  it's 1:03.... *sigh*             "
"           okay. so i am tired of being fat.    i realize i mentioned the atkins diet in my last (first) blog, and here i am again, about to talk about 'dieting' and being fat again.  one might think this is an ongoing thing for me.  or that i am obsessed with my appearance.  not really.  well, amber might argue with you on that one.  she has accused me on several occasions of obsessively looking in the mirror.  it's weird that i am one to do this, as i rarely like what i see there.  i guess i think if i keep looking, again and again, maybe i'll look better than i did the last time.  sadly, this doesn't seem to happen for me.    anyway, i am tired of being fat, like i said.  so, i have officially decided to change my life and stop mistreating my body by way of neglecting it.  i don't really believe in diets like atkins, or pills like hydroxycut or whatever other ones are out there.  i don't believe in quick, easy fixes.  the only thing that's ever worked for me before is changing what i eat, or how much, and exercising regularly.  period.    so, it's dumb to post about dieting, maybe, but i'm doing it because i'm finally making a decision to really make something happen here, and i consider this a way of holding myself accountable.  maybe i'll post progress on here or something.    my plan is to keep records and charts and all that stuff.  i like to see progress, or i'm get all discouraged and quit.  i'm going to try to write down what i eat, and what i do in the way of exercise, and i'm going to measure my big ole self once a week to see how it's all going.  i'm going to put it all in a folder, and on the folder, i am going to write 'OPERATION STOP BEING FAT' on the front, all decorated-like.  oh yes, my friends.  yes.    post number two.  i'm certainly not any cooler.  maybe i'll be healthier, though.  if anyone has any ideas about exercise or anything, do let me know.           "
"           so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  the blog craze is becoming like as unto the atkins diet, exept that  a) blogging, to me, seems cooler than not eating bread b) see reason a.   beginning a blog now, i feel a bit like i felt when i began to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  even though my friends tried to convince me that they were great books, i didn't start reading them until about a month before fellowship came out.  so i was officially not as cool as everybody who read the books based on their own merit, but boy, am i glad i didn't let that stop me from reading them.    anyhow, i named my blog the bandwagon to sort of make fun of myself and my one-step-behind-everyone-else-ness.    what will i write about?  beats me.  i don't have a theme, unless ME is a theme.  oh well.  maybe i will talk about sam, the little baby sitting behind me in his chair.  maybe i will post a quote i like.  maybe i will put some pictures on here or talk about taking pictures or developing them in my almost darkroom ('almost' because it is neither completely dark, nor completely equipped yet).  maybe i will talk about your mom.  i dunno.  anyway, i will post something other than an introduction soon.    later, friends.  *elclang*              "
"            crap the bed is what my good-and-no-longer-in-arkansas friend, rhonda, would say when something went wrong.  so i typed a big ole post and titled it 'ketchup,' cause i was catching up on posting.....i am clever. but not clever enough to save changes before i magestically erased them.  *sigh* i will try to recall said  erased  writings and ramblings.  updates on life.  operation:stop being fat! is not a complete failure. i still manage to semi-faithfully drink my giant jug of water. i haven't been so diligent about the notebook and charts and whatnot since vacation early in july. BUT! like i said, it's not all lost. i've dropped about 8 pounds and managed to keep off about 6. it's a start, i suppose.  the darkroom. it's getting there! amber and jess came down a while back for a fun and productive day of light-proofing the closet. it is now splendidly dark, thanks to caulk, insulation, foam, black plastic, and about 200 staples. i've processed 6 rolls of film (successfully!), but i haven't yet printed anything. that, however, may change as soon as today! mom's coming up with the enlarger table, and i bought a safelight bulb yesterday. i actually have two safelight bulbs now, thanks to amber (and sorry about the confusion, by the way)  anyhow, i may get around to it soon. i hope so. life is too busy, and i when i stop to think about what it is i've been doing that eats up all the hours, i can't really see that i've done all that much. is that how life is as you get old?  hmmm.  anyhow, go me for ketching up. i have some introspective-y things to say, but they wouldn't seem to flow here. perhaps i will post another while i wait for mom. i dunno how likely that is - Sam seems to be waking up!

"       Alright... I just browsed through a ton of blogs. I'm procrastinating working on my thesis... but it's so damn boring! Anyway, people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs! If you want random people to read about your life, don't post 2-word inside jokes... Blogs should be about your life... Or at least something worthwhile. Saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn IM away messages. Your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine! And mine aren't worthless. Mine are cool. They're not about 'I went to the store and bought some flip-flops' but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how I visited Bob Jones University 6 times in high school or about how I had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how I got kicked out of my Christian high school for having cigarettes in my car (I wasn't even smoking them!) or about how after this happened, I tried to commit suicide (that was long ago, I'm doing fine now, but thanks for asking) and while I was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until I could hardly breathe or swallow my God-fearing, compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how I was expelled. Well, at any rate... I won't bore you with worthless inside jokes. Hell, if you bother to read my blog, you'll be the better for it... you know why? Cuz I've got alot of really weird stories.           "
"       Well, I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it. I'm going to have lots of cool stuff on here, just you wait. All my opinions on stuff and my innovative fashion ideas and my rants and reviews of current fashions... then I'll tell you a thing or two about what it's like to live in Indiana... the most conservative place on earth I fear... and all my fears and opinions about politics.&nbsp; Then somewhere in the middle of it all... I'll tell you about my life.&nbsp; Maybe it will come out as part of the other two subjects, or maybe I'll just feel like ranting. But check back now and again and stay posted to my&nbsp;crazy world and all my opinions thereof. By the way, I work in a mental hospital and I have fascinating stories about my early Christian school experiences...&nbsp; stay tuned! ;-) &nbsp; Lily          "

"   Another blog to see. the next blog button is good for when your on a vacation and board. ive seen a lot of blogs and they belong to kids and men that are right out of state colleges. but this one is good. this woman is happy about her life. i think shes a single parent but she keeps busy with her daughter and writes provoking ideas. i wanted to comment like ive been doing to all the other blogs i went to but theres no room for one. read her post about being a bitch. for the three or four of you who read my blog Gio made a new blog for diferent users so we can all write in it. im going back to work next week so Sanne and Gio can write something for me to read not the other way around. ill send the link in email.  heres the link to the blog i told you about  urlLink becoming ex  "
"   Our last day before we headed back to finish out my vacation at home. we played on the ps2 for almost 3 hours and ate out for dinner. the kids were acting out at the restraunt and got in trouble. my sister in law overeacted to it though and caused a scene and was mad at the kids during the whole time. past all that we had a good time and we started for home later that evening. so now were back. Gio thinks I should delete the post about teenagers. the girl i had written about started spamming me. Gio is making a blog too so i'll let the rest of you know "
"   We saw open water. it sucked and was a waste. we went back and thought about renting goodfellas but the special edition didnt come out until tuesday and we wanted to wait for it. Gio didnt want to watch it he hates those movies that portray italian americans as violent and bad. we had a fight over it and we rented 13 going on 30 instead. it was a cute movie it was kind of like big. so the rest of you skip seeing open water and go rent 13 going on 30. "
"   Were back. we drove down to lawrenceville in nj. its a town a little north of trenton where some of my relatives live. we made it to my brothers house and i was so tired from the trip i fell asleep on the couch for 2 hours untill my sister in law woke me up for dinner. i have three neices april karen and christina and a nephew aaron. aaron likes Gio so he talked his ear off most of the evening untill he had to go to bed. we ate a lot and talked about going to see open water. "
"   We're getting ready for jersey. i got my two weeks vacation so i'm going to go visit some people and maybe go to the shore.  "
"   Gio got hit on by a female cabbie! lol  "
"   After reading other people's blogs for a month, I finally decided to get one for myself. the four of us tried to get tickets for chicago. Its playing at the ambassador theatre on west 49th if you're in the area. We didn't get them so we went out instead. Gio got the great idea to cross the bridge and go around little italy where he used to live before his x kicked him out just for some albachiara. for those of you that dont know it's a pizzeria and its real good &s but the rest of us didn't want to be out there so far but we went anyway.

"   What's really important? What's it all about, this Hellenism thing?  Hellenic Wiccans Hellenic Reconstructionists Hellenic Traditionalists: a term in flux, characterized by detractors in various ways (which we should really put to bed).  HT can also be used in contrast with HR in the sense of reconstructionism being an activity.  Hellenion: an organization of which I am a member and in which I am taking on more responsibility. Hellenion is suffering from some identity issues which should be resolved in order for the organization to move forward in a well-founded way.  Has been called 'too liberal', 'too conservative', and 'trying to be all things to all people'. The last accusation should be better stated:  1. Define the term. 2. How does it apply to Hellenion? 3. Even if it's true and applies to us, is it really all that bad?  OSNT has been called too inaccurate to recommend to newbies. Perhaps a good way to put this to bed is to recruit the detractors, asking them to detail the complaints they have with the book.  Hellenic Wicca: By all reputable accounts, a 20th-century innovation. It seems based on WMT, masonry, etc. There's fair enough reason to see Wicca as an off-shoot of WMT with a polytheistic wrapper of sorts. Most Wicca do not appear to be 'hard polytheists', but influenced by Jung, Joseph Campbell, etc. and see deity as archetype. Some of the particulars of Wiccan symbolism may stem from ancient Hellenic mystics, though. Wiccans who attempt to incorporate Hellenic deities as archetypes aren't going to be very popular with Recons, but we can benefit some of the more polytheistic Wiccans by providing research that can inform them.  Eclectics vs. dedicants of specific traditions: Eclectics may choose bits and pieces from traditions that seem to fit well together in their eyes. When eclectics are contrasted with recons, the recon will tend to lean toward a more holistic approach to a given cultural framework. Eclectics may be more likely to change fairly radically in view and practice over time, whereas recons will endeavor to become progressively more consistent in dealing with the specified cultural framework as more is learned and new research sheds new light on the subject matter.  Hellenic recons have a lot more to work with than some other recons who reconstruct cultures in which there was less literacy or from which less material survives today for various reasons.  We have to make decisions about whether we're going to reconstruct within our own cultural framework (animal sacrifice, women's rights, and pederasty being hot button points). Assuming we're going to do this, we have to deal with other issues, such as researching the ancient culture really well to transcend what Wittgenstein might call a 'language game' separating ourselves from the ancient culture we're reconstructing.  Language Games: Even under the best of circumstances (face-to-face conversation between people sharing common language and culture), language games limit communication. The greater the divide between individuals (due to language, culture, etc.), the more severe the limitations placed upon communication, and the more challenging the reconstruction process. For instance, there are serious differences between an English-speaking 21st-century North American and an Attic-speaking Athenian from the era of Socrates, which present situations with which we simply need to come to terms. Most HR's I have encountered so far seem to have a basic respect for this.  Adopting antagonistic stances further complicates the process of communicating and reconstructing effectively.  Once one states a position, one becomes open to criticism and 'Socratic' questioning. It might be tempting to turn the tables on the accusers, but this is generally not a good idea. Readers and viewers of this sort of thing can generally see the pettiness and egocentrism of it. A better solution is to extend xenia and hospitality to our detractors as much as possible, not as a strategy but to reinforce community. We're an amazingly small minority and should come together as opposed to further driving one another away. Differences need not imply divisiveness. A communitarian and inclusive approach, founded on mutual respect and humility before the gods is the way to go.  We need to beef up our programs such as Hymnodia and publish lots of practical material for people to use in their own study and practice. If our publications are criticized, we should accept the criticism. If the criticism is spurious, accept it as so and move on, but if there's something in it we can use to improve our work, let's be grateful for it and use it to enhance the integrity of our efforts.  More on culture: We have to be honest with ourselves about some of the realities we're dealing with. It is astonishingly difficult to reproduce an ancient culture with great precision, which does not imply that the effort lacks merit.  Some people rely more or less heavily on UPG, which is perfectly fine but presents challenges when it comes to persuading others of one's findings. If you don't present your findings as founded on good research, you need to rely on something else in argumentation, such as results of some kind.  Not everyone is going to go for your approach, no matter which approach you employ. Even if every single Recon on the planet does agree with you, we're a startlingly small fraction of the world's population. So ultimately I think it's really important to invest your energies and efforts in something important to you and in which you find satisfaction. "
"   Recons have a fascinating tendency to focus on minutia (which is one of those words that doesn't look right when you see how you've spelled it, but passes the dictionary.com test). This can be both great and positively miserable (maybe simultaneously, but misery has a way of making it hard to see greatness).  Some of what's great about it is that we can sometimes make really neat discoveries in the process of picking little crap apart, which can then be passed on to those who have lives.  Some of what's miserable about it is that one can fail to 'see the forest for the trees' as the old saying goes.  For instance, I recently read a great deal of discussion about libation, which is a well-loved topic for me. (See the meaning of the term  sponde  for more on why.) In the discussion, I saw the libation process picked apart, but much more emphasis seemed to be placed on how a certain author had  really screwed up  by describing the libation process in a manner that didn't set well with some of the people involved in the discussion.  One simple fact of the matter is that libations (like many other facets of ancient Hellenic religious practice) were actually quite varied in detail depending on who was libating under what circumstances. To cite Burkert's  Greek Religion  (which may be over-hyped, but is still a darn good book), p. 71:   When Achilles sends Patroclus out to battle, he takes from his chest the cup from which he alone drinks, cleans it, washes his hands, and draws the wine; then, stepping into the court, he pours out the wine and, looking up to the sky, prays for the victory and safe return of his friend.      Libation could be quite simple. Period.       Elaborate rites were carried out, as were simple, spontaneous acts of devotion, prayer, desperation, etc.  But (and seriously check this out), even the ancient Hellenes practiced Reconstructionism! I kid you not, and cite Burkert again (p. 107):    The meal in the sanctuary may be marked as extraordinary when, in contrast to normal civilization, the ancient way of life is imitated: a bed of twigs,  stibas , takes the place of seats or banqueting couches, and the house is replaced by an improvisational hut,  skene  -- misleadingly translated as tent. The twigs on which one sits assume a symbolic character which varies according to deity and festival: pine or willow for the Thesmophoria, and wild olive branches in Olympia.    So.....  Should we have Recon banquets in which we reconstruct the ancient Hellenic practice of reconstructing even more ancient practices?  And did any ancients ever come down hard on other ancients who used the wrong twigs for a given festival?        "
"   I'm a bit concerned about some of the divisions I see within Hellenic polytheism these days.  It's not the divisions themselves which concern me, because variation is good. We shouldn't be overspecialized, but should represent the diversity present within the community.  Hellenic polytheism includes, but isn't limited to Hellenion and other 'Hellenic Reconstructionist' groups and individuals, Hellenic wiccans, people devoted to Hellenic deities but not all that concerned with reconstructionism, a 'group' (for lack of a better word) called 'Hellenic Traditionalists' and more.  What  does  concern me is what seems like divisive behavior driving potential wedges between us all in ways that aren't necessarily healthy or helpful. I'm talking about antagonistic behavior, of which any of us can be guilty from time to time, but which I've been witnessing more than I feel comfortable with here lately.  Drew Campbell's book is not beyond criticism, but it's also far from worthless. I've seen Hellenion called too liberal, too conservative, and that it tries to be all things to all people, and the simple fact is that these can not all be objectively true at the same time. People make statements reflecting their subjective impressions, and those statements are objectified (sometimes by the speaker, and sometimes by offended readers/listeners).  Can't we all try to get along?  Since the  very first day  that sponde.com came into being, I've tried to get people from various camps to contribute articles, hymns, and pretty much  anything  else. But so far, almost every word of content on the site has come from members of Hellenion, the organization that everyone seems to love to hate. Does this mean that only Hellenion members are publishing things of value? I'd hesitate to go that far, but I would much rather be able to offer a definite  NO .  I'm not sure I have one simple solution to this problem, but I do think that we'd be better off if we poured more of this energy into actual Hellenic polytheism. Isn't that something we can agree on enough to put all this other stuff to bed?  "

"             I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is 'Hot Head' from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the 'Little Black Top' from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the 'Little Black (olive!) Top', and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the 'Under the Hoodie', again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen. I'm also planning on a cardigan by Kristin Sperklund from the  urlLink Interweave  free subscriber patterns for Viv, but I have yet to buy yarn or anything. I need to start thinking holidays, too!  Okay. That's it for my first foray into blogging! C            "
"             I finished another  urlLink tiny ribby tank , except I changed it up a bit-- crossed the straps in the back and did a 3-needle bind-off instead of kitchener to graft the straps. This one is for my friend J's little cutie. Hopefully she will send me a picture of C modeling it!     Now, onto Cleo for real. C         "
"             Look at this yummy yarn:   It came today, for  urlLink Cleo , for my oldest sister. I'm so pleased she decided to order this yarn. It's soft and the color is amazing. Kinda splitty, but I think I'll get used to it. And, for the first time in my personal swatching history, my gauge was spot-on the very first try! I love  urlLink elann.com . I got a good price on the yarn, and I received my order in two business days. I'm excited to start it, but I think I will finish up Tiny Ribby Tank #2 first. C         "
"             Here's Vivienne in her new tank:     poser!     She immediately pulled like crazy on one of the straps & stretched it all to hell. Damn cotton. I washed it on warm/ gentle and it looked really messed up upon coming out of the wash, so I now have it on delicate tumble dry with hopes it's not ruined. Ayeeee. C         "
"             A LiveJournal friend recently knit  urlLink this cute tank  for her daughter, and I was inspired to make one for Miss Viv. I happened to get some uber-clearance Lily Baby Cotton, so this cost me seriously less than $3 to knit. I had to learn kitchener stitch, which sounded easier than it was. Actually, the execution wasn't that hard, but it doesn't look that great. I need to figure out the trick to making it look nice & neat, I guess. Anyway, overall, I'm pleased with the top.     The very middle stripe is leftover variegated cotton I had from some dishcloths. It looks much better in person than it does in the picture. It's obviously too late to have V model it, so I will add a picture of her showing it off tomorrow. These quickie projects are very satisfying to instant-gratification types like me.  The yarn arrived for my sister's  urlLink Cleo  halter. It isn't quite as it appeared on my monitor. I guess there's the flaw in bargain-hunting online. I think it will work out okay, though. That's the next thing on the needles, and I will work on my hoodie here & there, too. I really want to make a big, soft afghan, too, in hopes my husband will finally get rid of the holey, sun-bleached, monkey-vomit-green one he's had forever. C                         "
"             I made the Umbilical Cord Hat from S'nB for a friend's new baby this evening. It's nice to know there's a pattern I can just whip out in an evening when friends have babies! It's cream-colored, despite looking white in the photo.     Such a nice, easy thing to knit! C         "
"             So my ice cream cozy was featured on  urlLink Cozy of the Week . If you want to knit one, too, here's the made-up-as-I-went pattern:  On size 5 US double pointed knitting needles, cast on 48 stitches, join, and divide among 3 needles.  Knit 3 rows in k2p2 rib.   Knit two rows.   Add in scrap novelty yarn and knit however much you want with that.   When you are about halfway done, k2tog after the sixth stitch on each needle.   Add more eyelash or whatever as you see fit. About 3/4 way through, do the k2tog decrease again.  For the next 2 rows, k2p2 rib, then cast off in rib. The last row should be the bottom of your cozy.  I'm thinking after I finish the second sleeve, I'm going to put my hoodie aside for a bit. I need to knit the Umbilical Cord Hat from Stitch 'n Bitch for a friend's new baby, then I think I'll knit up one of  urlLink these  cuties for Viv. I got some Lily Baby Cotton for next to nothing today at Joann, since my store is moving and they are clearing everything out. I think it will work well for both the umbilical cord hat and the tiny ribby tank. C         "
"             It's not so beautiful outside today, and T & I were out late celebrating his birthday last night, which leads me to think today would be a good day to sit around and knit. Unfortunately, I'm really sick of my hoodie. I can't start Viv's cardigan, since I'm waiting for the yarn to arrive. I can't start Cleo for my sister, because again, I'm waiting for the yarn. Ayeee. I guess I will just tough it our and work on the hoodie. I just want to be done with it already. I should look through my stash to see if I have some random cotton to make Viv a little tank. So, the new issue of  urlLink Knitty . People are all a-swirl on the various knitting communities. People seems to feel strongly. I don't. I think some of the stuff is cute, though I am more inclined to make things I can show off, I guess because I'm still newish and it feels like such a giant accomplishment every time I finish a piece. I am considering making  urlLink hush hush . It's really beautiful. I might wear it in public, actually. I'm thinking a silvery grey with black and hot pink ribbon. Ohh, Maybe I'll knit the top in black, the rest in the silvery grey and pink ribbon. Hmmmm. If I do, I'm sure it will take me ages. I can see it being something to have perpetually in progress when I get sick of scarves, hats and sweaters over the winter, and then voila! Next spring, I'd have a lovely little nightie/ dress. We'll see. Time to vacuum and do dishes, then I will hunker down with the sleeves to my hoodie. C         "
"             I finally got through the lace band! It's really a cool pattern, once you sit down and do it with out small-child interruptions! I expect I'll finish the body today and then I need to go back and make another triangle.     It's a little dark, and it's squished onto the circs, but you get the idea.  What's next? I am going to finish off a Big Bad Baby Blanket for my friend,  urlLink langus , who has thrown in the towel. Then I need to decide whether to focus on a bag for me-- I've got some  Lamb's Pride Bulky in black and a nice deep pink waiting for me to knit & felt. I have a cardigan I want to start for Viv. I need to go back and add the hood to my hoodie. And then there's xmas presents... I'm pretty sure there will always be plenty of projects awaiting me from here on out. C         "
"             oh. my. god.  Cleo is slowly killing me. I've ripped out one of the bra triangles twice. I got sick of that, so I moved on to the lace band, and guess what? I've ripped it out not once, not twice, but ohhhh 5 or 6 times! I've lost count. I need one full evening of total silence to get the lace band done, and done right.  If I don't get it right next time, I may throw in the towel and come back to it next spring. ugh.  I hate when knitting sucks. C         "

"             I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.  We were talking about where Koreans put their money.  Invariably, they have a lot of real estate and cash.  (Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts.)  The reason?  Real estate makes money here.  A lot of money.  I've seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 10-15% PER YEAR for long stretches, even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis (referred to as the IMF crisis here, although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out).  Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 90-99% in 1997 and only modestly recovered, and a local stock market (represented by KOSPI, or their version of the Dow Jones Index) that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1,000 points (it is now about 800 points, see  urlLink link ) and you can see why real estate makes sense here.  But back to the conversation...I noted that here a 'real big' or 'elite' real estate investor has over 6 billion won (about USD 5,000,000, see  urlLink converter ) in properties.  Dad seemed a little flabbergasted.  'What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for?  They don't need that much to retire.'  Maybe so, but there is a lot of risk here too.  Take real estate (or any other South Korean asset) for example: if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5,000,000 USD is worth about 5 cents.  Also, all of it is denominated in won which, during the 'IMF Crisis', dropped about 50% vis-a-vis the USD. Also, if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scam--the latest here was the  urlLink Good Morning City  project--you're toast.  I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it.  Her comment (between the tears): 'Now I know what it's like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day.'  If you have one of those, some saber-rattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out.  The government has almost zero help for unemployed, disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers.  The role of family is more important here...so if you have money you should help your family, and if you don't then you should go to them first.  Thus the idea that more is more.  Koreans go all out in most things they do, and investing is no different.  Why have one apartment when you can have 7?  The  urlLink jeonse  system supports this as well.  You see, if you have a 400,000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea (neither of which are the Western ones, except in rare circumstances).  1.  Renter signs a 2-year contract and deposits about half the market value (200,000 USD) with the owner.  No monthly rent is paid, but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 4-5% per year.  That's a monthly rent/return of $750.  At the end of the term the 200,000 USD is returned to the renter.  2.  Renter signs a 1-year or 2-year contract and deposits about 10%-20% of the market value of the property (10,000-20,000 USD) plus some monthly rent of $400-$600 a month.  In both cases, if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be topped-up or partially refunded.  (Of course I'm using USD in this to save my '0' key and to help 'foreigners' reference it better.)  Thus, if you buy a place for $400,000 you can turn around and rent it out and get $200,000 to (if you like) buy another place or whatever.  Since there are very, very few mortgages in Korea (kind of a cash society, although there are home-equity lines of credit) the system here is a bit different.  The key, of course, is that real estate prices keep going up.         "
"             Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.  In the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle 'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke' (to the tune of 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing') that pretty much summed up the post-Woodstock era so well.  It didn't add much to sales, but it was a catchy tune.  In Korea Coke's theme is  urlLink Stop Thinking. Feel it.  which pretty much sums up a lot about Korea and Koreans.  (Look at how relaxed that couple is, now that they stopped thinking and started feeling.) Of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such, but deep down I think many Koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else.  Westerners seem to sublimate this moreso, or at least display it in a different way.  Maybe scratch all that...Westerners and Koreans are probably pretty similar, but the context in which we do it is different.  Anyways, if you think you're losing it in Korea just repeat to yourself 'Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it.' and everything will be alright.         "
"             If anything, Korea is a country of extremes.  Everything here seems fad-based.  I think it may come from Korea's history.  It has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years, and each time they got independence I imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation.  Lately (well, not really lately...in 1945) the Japanese Occupation ended.  Then the Korean War occurred from 1950-3.  After that there was turmoil, but in 1961 Park Chung Hee took over as dictator/president.  He had elections, in which everyone was 'encouraged' to vote, but he was still a dictator.  After his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk.  President Park did some amazing things in his time, however.  He took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization. Japan had stripped Korea of its resources, people and even its language and culture (many buildings and palaces were razed and Japanese was the official language here from 1910-1945) but President Park was determined to change that.  He orchestrated the 'Han River Miracle' (the Han River, or Hangang 한강 is the main river in Seoul/Korea) and Korea made terrific strides, if at the expense of some civil liberties.  Fastforward to the present, and my point, and we see that Korea is the world's #1 wired nation.  More than Canada, Finland and way beyond the U.S.A.  There was a craze to have PC방s (PC bangs or rooms) EVERYWHERE in the country.  As well, instead of PlayStation-like games where players go against the computer or one or two people, Korean gamers (always the communal types) play online games with hundreds or thousands of others. in typical Korean fashion, gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game...in fact, they may be eliminated.  So PCbang owners sold drinks, ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele.  It was just a matter of time before someone died, as related in  urlLink this article .  Yes, someone died from being on the PC.  People thought he was just sleeping (imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out) but, alas, he was the first known casulty of the Net in Korea, maybe the world.  Korea, built on extremes, both good and bad.         "
"             Take a read of this news article from urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  about North Korea's opinion on the scaling down of troops in Seoul and Korea (specifically, 3,600 troops are heading to Iraq and by the end of 2005 the current total of 37,000 should drop to about 24,500).   North blasts U.S. troop cuts  North Korea again blasted the United States yesterday for what it calls 'an increase of U.S. defense capabilities' after the planned relocation of 3,600 U.S. troops in South Korea to Iraq. Pyeongyang's state-run television network said the plans were preparations for a second Korean war.  'Even though part of the U.S. ground forces will be transferred to Iraq, instead of causing a capability vacuum, U.S. President Bush is augmenting his war policy against the North,' the broadcast complained.  'The U.S. security commitment [to South Korea] is a commitment for preemptive war against us,' the current affairs commentary said.     Ok, let me get this straight...moving troops OUT of South Korea and, further, OUT of the area closest to North Korea (the DMZ, or DeMilitarized Zone) is somehow INCREASING the U.S. defense capabilities in South Korea???  Well, I've read a lot of North Korean propaganda (such as at  urlLink DPRK.com , check out the DPRK News section) but this one is pretty unreal.  And with that I'd like to remind everyone that those in the DPRK (I should tell you that means Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea) are probably very good people, it's just the leadership that seems to be making all the waves (I could be wrong, but I'm not going to go up there and find out).  The Korean War from 1950-3 was a brutal event that severed many families...some of whom are now lucky enough to see their aged relatives again (remember, it's been 50+ years) in special reunion projects (albeit only for a few hours before everyone is whisked off to their respective countries).  Many, however have or will pass on without ever seeing a sister, brother, child, parent or boy/girlfriend again.  We in the West, especially Canada where we've never had a war on our own soil except the War of 1812, could never fully comprehend such things.  It really makes your wonder how far one would go to support ideology...I guess we have an idea now.         "
"             I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.  Sometimes, though, one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers...especially the local ones.  Here are two examples of how the English version of the Korea Times and that of the JoongAng Ilbo (Daily).  The first is pretty straightforward.   urlLink Korea Times  said that 249 people were arrested for forging Korean passports, but  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  says just 114 were accused.  Huh?  Another one:  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  said that S&P is positive on Korean banks (a good thing), while the  urlLink Korea Times  said that S&P was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and medium-sized firms.  I have no idea why the simple facts seem to be presented so differently...it can't simply be translation, can it?         "
"             Ah, the Korean language...it looks so difficult at first, then as you figure out how to read Hanguel (Korea's surprisingly easy-to-learn alphabet of 24 characters) it seems so easy. Then the vocabulary starts. Oh no. Then the backwards (to us) sentence structure.  Yikes!  Luckily there are many options for us slow-witted foreigners to take on the language.  Of course I could list them here but  urlLink this JoongAng article  says a lot and there are more resources  urlLink here .    Well, if you're a guy here is some motivation for you: Jeon Ji Hyun (전지현), the latest 20-something (24, actually) star of movies and CFs (I hear this means Commercial Feature, but not positive).  I saw her latest movie on Sunday night.  It's hard to describe the name...the English version is 'Windstruck' but the Korean version is 여친소 (yeochinso) which is short for 내여자친구를소개합니다 (ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida) or 'I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend'.  Surprisingly, both titles make sense.  If you like, there is a website (Korean and English, looks quite good, actually)  urlLink here .  The movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times, that info is  urlLink here . For a list of many of the theatres in Seoul click....  urlLink here!    urlLink    Here is a great reason to learn Korean...if I wasn't already married, that is.  I went with a few foreigners as well as a local/Korean/National...of course the Korean HAD to take a picture...so I HAVE to put it up here.   urlLink    Here we are after the movie...and before the hof/bar.     Update:  A bud of mine passed  urlLink this link  on to me. It's 전지현 in a Giordano ad. Apparently it was NOT aired in Korea (nothing XXX about it, it's all about sensibilities of some sort).

"             If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig, as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.  But blogger.com figured it would be more appropriate to call it Year of the Boar/bore...thanks guys.  Anyways, you may be wondering how a fat, lazy, smelly Canadian guy born in a little town waaaaaay up north finds himself in a place like Seoul...and Yeouido, no less, where only a handful of foreigners visit, let alone live and work.  The culprit is my wife.  She is Korean, as you may know, and when I was doing financial consulting in Canada we came across an interesting client.  He found us through his wife's (see a pattern here?  Korean women rule the men) reading my column in the Vancouver Chosun (Chosun is the name of the last dynasty to rule Korea--it was ended by the 1910-1945 Japanese occupation) which you'll find  urlLink here . It's all in Korean, my email and webpage have changed, though.  Anyways, this client is a big guy here in Seoul as well as in Canada and wanted (for some reason) to do something for us...so the next time he went to Seoul we went as well (with our first son, second one wasn't around yet).  When we arrived in Seoul for our 2-3 week visit we met his 'godfathers' as he called them.  He wasn't mixed up in anything, he just liked the sound of being untouchable.  From there we met another guy then another guy and then, the next day, my current CEO.  We had what economists call a 'coincidence of wants'.  He wanted a foreigner with training and experience in securities and alternative assets and I wanted a guy with the connections to get things done in Seoul.  After a week or so of meeting for dinner and such (his English was pretty good and is better now, but my wife did a lot of translation in the first part) he said: 'Don't go back to Canada, stay here and work with me.'  Not work for me...with me.  That was interesting.  I knew he had a more enlightened view than most Korean bosses right then and there.  So here I am.  It's not perfect, I can't speak a lot of the language and sometimes I almost go nuts here what with the differences in culture and business, but it's not bad at all.  I also go home every 2 months or so (my wife had baby #2 in Canada and is still there for a bit longer) which means lots of time in airplanes.  I always fly  urlLink Singapore Air  but even then, the prospect of being in the air for 100 hours a year is not all that appealing (ya, that's over 4 DAYS flying, over 1% of the year).  I do, however, watch about 20-25 movies a year on the plane, which is cool because Singapore Air has individual monitors with on-demand TV and movies for ALL passengers.         "
"             Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.  I recently met a couple of finance-types here in Yeouido (which isn't too hard to do, as it's referred to as Korea's Wall Street) who spoke pretty good English (which is a rarity here not only in Yeouido but everywhere in Korea).  They had studied outside Korea and deal with international business...but still my brutal Canadian accent made it pretty tough for them to figure out what I was saying sometimes.  There was one time that their accent got in the way, though.  When we went to the restaurant the guy (Junseok, the gal is named Hye-Kyung) asked: 'Do you like deok?'  I wrote it just as I heard it.  I thought he meant dog (they eat that here) so I called his bluff and said, 'Sure, let's go! What kind of dog?' 'Oh no, deok, deok!' 'Ya, dog?' 'No, deok,' he said again. Then I figured out that he meant 'duck' and said, 'Oh, &#50724;&#47532; (oh-ri), duck! Not &#44060; (gay), dog! Why didn't you just speak Korean?  I know &#50724;&#47532; and &#44060;!'  The food was great, then we went to the obligatory 이차 (ee-cha, thanks Hye-Kyung for the correction) or second round.  Koreans can never just go to one place to eat and drink.  Usually we will wander the streets and go out to three, four or five places. A couple of weeks ago in Hongdae (university bar district here) we went to 4 places: the &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) restaurant, Old Rock (cool bar), a &#45432;&#47000;&#48169; (noraebang, Korean word for karaoke) and finally clubnb (or noise basement) until the wee hours of the morning.  (Personally I prefer the Kangnam version of clubnb, but since we were in Hongdae we went to that one.)  The coolest thing here about bar-hopping/pub-crawling is there is almost never a lineup and very rarely a cover (just in the clubs, never in bars).  I think this is because people are always moving.  In Canada if you get in a bar you never, never leave until you go home...which means those who want to get in have to lineup.  Also, if a Korean is asked to wait (for anything, especially after a few drinks) they will just balk and leave...and no bar-owner would like that.  Maybe that's why Koreans in general are moving around more and Canadians are so sedate (relatively...if you've lived in both places you know what I mean).   Update:  looks like everyone wants to be on my blog...for some reason.  Here are the pics of my gracious hosts of the evening.   urlLink    Junseok, who works in International Business and has an MBA...he's trying to come up with a fitting Western name for himself, if you have one to suggest just leave a comment, please.   urlLink    Hae-Kyung, who works with him.  She too has an MBA (and from my wife's alma mater of Ewha Women's University, no less).  Hae-Kyung is really good at English and is quite bright...and single (men, take note). She thinks her face looks like the moon, or 달덩이 (Daldeong-ee) as they say here, I guess so...         "
"             There is so much that is different here from anything I've ever seen (well, I haven't travelled that much, just in Canada, the US, Philippines and Japan).  And I mean totally different.  Maybe it's because I've been here long enough to see a lot, I dunno.  Anyways, if you'd like more on this place take a look at my  urlLink Virtual Tourist pages .         "
"              urlLink    Here it is, the superfantastic phonebox!  Today is a great day.  Our lovely officegirl Jung Mi (please no letters, that's what secretaries are called here) went to LG Twins building and got me a new phone.  I really needed one on account of (i) my old one was all in Korean...which was fine because I memorized where to go to do things on it...and (ii) the screen kept going blank because I produce copious amounts of sweat when I inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time.  Well, after 4 screens at 60,000 won a pop I decided it's time to get a new one...but I may end up breaking this one too.  It's soooooo cooooool.  It has a little camera which I used to take a picture of the box (of course it took me a while to figure out that I couldn't use it to take a pic of the actual phone).  I also took a pic of our lovely officegirl...and then inputted her name and number as well...then ordered up caller ID (something I didn't have before, much to my chagrin).  Then I asked her to call me to test it out.  Her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone (how cool is that?!?!) and she immediately started panicking and saying, 'Change! Change!'  haha, Some Korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them.  She did, however, insist that I put the pic on this posting...go figure.  This phone really rocks.  I can take pictures, email them or send to other phones, and send and receive normal emails too. Also, it has a language converter so everything is finally in English.  It's tiny, too...like the size of a fat businesscard.   urlLink    Here she is doing the Korean sign for 'take my picture'.   urlLink    Here is a coworker of mine with the same pose.  Why? Why?         "
"             One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers.  I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me.  For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought:  2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried 고구마 (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each)  The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago.  The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years.  Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me.  Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck.  This guy stops in the hotspots and unloads silk and polyester ties on neckwear-hungry salarymen.   urlLink    Here they are: 2 for 5,000 won (USD 4.50)!         "
"              urlLink    Wonderful oh-gyup-sal at my favorite pork restaurant.  It's official, pork has now outstripped beef as the top meat import to Korea.  (See  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo link ) and no wonder...what with Mad Cow Disease and Avian Flu virus going around.  The only thing that seems 'safe' is pork.  Of course, as you may know, oh-gyup-sal literally means 5 layers of fat...so maybe it's not super healthy.  Well, I wasn't that bad, I did do 2 hours of inline skating (as they call it here...rollerblading seems to have a tough time rolling off the Korean tongue) beforehand...but the 오겹살 was drowned by a lovely concoction called 오십세주 (oh-ship-say-joo) which is a 50/50 mix of 백세주 (baek-say-ju, literally: hundred year alcohol) and 소주 (soju, literally: booze) thus the translation of the combined drink is called 50 year alcohol.  Intersting, eh?           "
"             Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam, and my wife's ears).  It seems The Grand Hyatt Hotel's (in Itaewon)  urlLink J.J. Mahoney's  has a reputation for beautiful Korean ladies using it as a place to pick up foreign (likely white) men...even married ones.  So, if you're single and looking for a good time check out J.J.'s (just bring a lot of dough, the prices are about two times that of most other Western bars).  If you're married...well, that's up to you (you should know that some of the gals on the prowl there are 'ladies for sale' there was well, and the prices are reportedly quite high).  If your man is in Seoul and reading this (or otherwise knows the score) better get a polygraph...from what I saw some of those gals are pretty good looking (not that I was looking, of course).  Well, that's it for tonight.  I gotta take the boy to school tomorrow at like 9AM (which is early for my vacation-time now).         "
"             Well, I stand corrected, again.  Yesterday I blogged that Coquitlam was an oasis of Whiteness in the sea of Asians that is Vancouver, but oh how I was wrong.  We went to the, aptly named, Coquitlam Mall today and put Spencer in the play area with a few other kids.  I heard a lady speaking Korean to her boy, then a flock (well, three) ajumas (older Korean ladies) came and sat near us.  Later, when we went to the pool, we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are Koreans too.  Then on the way back I learned that another two sets of neighbors are Korean as well.  They're everywhere!  It's actually pretty cool.  One thing about Koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community.  Get a group of white people (who aren't farmers) together and we seem to be pretty stand-offish...or at least it takes a while to warm up.  Koreans, as you may know,  urlLink refer to each other as sister or brother  as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another (as I have seen).  This is, I think, quite extraordinary.  From first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area 'nuna' or 'older sister, as said by a  younger brother' (they have a special word for every family member).  Also, since Koreans don't normally take to English all that well (or quickly) they really, really appreciate speaking with someone from home.  Thus, the community here is quite tight.  So I've still got jetlag...although it's pretty nice not to have to work through it.  The boys tend to keep me moving all day, though.  Usually I sleep at 3AM or 4AM then get up at 11AM, but it's not a good  urlLink REM  sleep.  My best sleep seems to be 1-2 hour naps at 3PM or 7PM.  When I wake up from those it's really like getting up in the morning; and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight.  My father-in-law thinks I should just adjust 100% in like 2 days, but I'm not sure if I'm built that way.  If I need to I can do it, but it's like I'm on vacation here.  Besides, I do my work at night anyways, when the kids are asleep (and Seoul is awake).  I guess that's it for now.  Nothing more profound than this from the day, which is a little sad.  I love it here: so clean, peaceful and easy to live; but I kinda miss Seoul too: so dirty, loud and easy to get run down by  urlLink deliveryboys on motorcycles .         "
"             So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam, actually.  It's really an interesting place; I used to think it was full of Chinese people (not that there's anything wrong with that, but Vancouver's #1 mother tongue is Mandarin/Cantonese, so you'd assume there'd be tons here).  Our area is up on a hill in a little bit of paradise, actually.  It has started to remind me of Newport in that show  urlLink The O.C.  (O.C. means Orange County).  Well, it isn't full of million dollar homes (but there are a few) but the topography is similar (hills, lots of parks, but no beach) and it's really, really white here.  I think the only Koreans I've seen have been family and Ensign Harry Kim on Star Trek: Voyager (ya, still have jetlag...watching anything that hits the screen here).  On that note, I think I'm having T.V. overload.  Well, with the kids I don't get to see too much of it, but when I do I'm boggled by the 60+ stations (and that's not even satellite!) and all, save one, of them are in ENGLISH!  Wow!  In Seoul I didn't even bother with cable so all I had was  urlLink AFN  (American Forces Network) (that guy on the homepage is their 6:30 newsanchor...the very reason I like to inline/rollerblade from 6-8PM).  Even if you have cable you only get like 2-3 other 'B' movie stations...nothing to write home about.  Truth be told, though, AFN has a pretty good lineup and I get to learn all about opsec (operational security) and that the U.S. Army in Korea is looking for E-4s and E-5s (enlisted ranks) to be MPs (Military Police).  So if you can handle the G.I. ads AFN is pretty cool.  Anyways, I didn't remember so many ads for weight-loss programs, get-rich-quick schemes and fantastic kitchen products, but there they were.  Of course in Korea most people are pretty fit and they know the best way to get rich is to marry rich or work hard--there are some ads there for kitchen and cleaning product, though, proving that some things truly are universal.  One ad that did throw me, though, was one for a 'male enhancement' pill.  What?!?!?  You take a pill for a bigger willi?  One version even had about 30 allusions to 'wood' throughout it.  I thought it was a spoof...maybe it was...it was on CNBC during  urlLink The Dennis Miller Show .   If anyone knows, please comment.  Ok, back to my time here.  We went down to the clubhouse to have a dip (ya, it's a little swanky...but the pool is outside, so it's not super-swanky) and there were some 18-something gals there sunning themselves and gabbing.  Man, this is NOT Seoul.  For one thing, no one actually tries to get a tan in Korea.  They wear Darth Vader-inspired visors to keep out all the rays they can and everyone is totally covered up.  Even when exercising Korean have pants, long-sleeves,  even suits .  Also, two of the three of them were 'plus size'.  They weighed like 2-3 TIMES that of a typical Korean gal.  (Not that that's a bad thing...it's just differences...please, no flames.)  Then you have to think...if they are 18 aren't they still in school?  By that I mean, they have not graduated from college.  An 18-year old Korean would be in the library or at a DVD bang, at least.  Most likely not at a pool (and I hear they're there everyday for hours on end)...what a different lifestyle.  Even after school is finished they'd be working or looking for a husband, or both.  Let's face it, many Koreans have little time to be idle (I must say, they do take time to drink and go to the sauna, though).  Maybe I'm becoming too Korean now, beating up these gals simply for having a little fun.  All I know is if they did that in Korea people might think they are  urlLink R.S.  (room salon, or places where men pay women to drink with them, sing with them and...uh...do other things) girls.  Maybe that's part of the Korean ideal.  Women should study and work and find a husband and if they are 'wasting' their time everyday then they must be of low moral fiber.  Hmmmm...there could be something to that.  Maybe it's part of the reason why so many Korean gals work their butts off (literally, Korean women are usually devoid of a derriere) and seem to push off their own pleasure in some Calvinist tradition.  Korean men seem to support this as it not only support the Confucius ideals that many Koreans follow but makes their place as symbolic leader of the home that much more solid (whether it is deserved or not, and we know that in many Korean homes a strong wife controls more than she advertises).         "
"             Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her, because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.  As with most things Korean, mothers go all out...right from before conception to...well, it never stops.    Today I got a taste of that.  What a day!  My 3-year old (Spencer) woke me up at 9AM (which is early seeing as I still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3AM last night).  The younger, Winston, was already up, too.  My wife and I must have fed these kids like 5-7 times during the day, they just never stop!  Spencer and I went to his swimming class.  We get a discount on regular swimming since he's enrolled.  The gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well...I really had no idea what was happening and said, 'I'm not sure.'  She said, in no uncertain terms, that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not.  I just said, ok, he is, how much?  Let's see $1.30 plus $2.60...$3.90.  You've got to be kidding?! You're bent about chun-on? (1,000 won/$1.15)?  This would not happen in Seoul.  They'd see Spencer and pay HIM to come into there!  Anyways, what I did with him in the pool was pretty much what the 'instructor' did as well...but she had 3 kids to handle.  I thought he'd be doing lengths or strokes, but I guess not yet.  After swimming I got my wife a Starbucks coffee.  She loves the stuff, and apparently can't justify to herself to buy herself one...those selfless Korean women, bless their hearts.  After I came home there was shopping to do.  I volunteered to go (kudos for me and time to think), then I suggested Spencer come too (thought he'd fall asleep in the car, especially after swimming) then thought we might as well all go (the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete).  Well, the kids stayed up the whole time and I started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you (I'm usually in Seoul) and it's just you two (her mother and sister were out of town).  Good God, these kids didn't sleep until 11PM!  Someday they'll make great investment bankers, I mused.  To all those out there who are single parents, or even just parents, get yourself a Starbucks...you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold, but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds.         "
"             My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.  Apparently this is the new fad in Korea...men are asked 'if your wife and your mother are drowning (neither can swim) and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose?'.  Many men say, 'my mother, because I can always remarry...but I can never replace my mom.'  Ok, true enough, but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow I know said, in front of a throng of relatives (including his wife) that he'd save his mom.  The wife was not impressed.  Let's look at this on a more cultural level for a moment.  Much of Korean tradition is based on Confucius' teachings; where younger take care of elder, women take care of men and duty to family is first.  Parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education, lifestyle and necessities; children, in turn, are expected to do the same when they have the means.  Thus, a man should choose to save his mother, who did everything for him (and perhaps still does) rather than his wife who is a bit of a late-comer.  The reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict.  A husband's mother often endures a lot from her husband, children, society and her own mother-in-law and, not one to stop the cycle, she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife.  She comes to pry into, advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couple's lives under the guise of helping her dear son.  With divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately; and now people are getting a little pre-emptive, perhaps, in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions.  So, men, if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it (probably your wife) take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can.  Just remember, you likely sleep with your wife every night, not your mother.         "
"             As readers will know, my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).  They have those personal monitors for everyone with on-demand movies, TV shows and games..and some lovely-looking stewardesses, of course.  Another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers.  I've twice been bumped up to business class (with it's better meals and basically flat sleeper beds...what an experience that is).  Once because the travel agent made a mistake and SAI decided they'd make my life a bit easier (hint: if you take the same flight 5-10 times they get to know you, too) and another time my flight was overbooked so I too business to San Francisco and got another one to Vancouver (both covered by SAI) as well as 500 Sing$ (300 USD, 350,000 won) which made for a 40% discount from my ticket price.  Anyways, this time I was in line for about 30 minutes (maybe it was longer) and a few times I squatted to relieve my legs a bit.  The gal at the counter apologized and put 2 'Solitaire' tags on my bags (will upload pic when I get back to Seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own) that basically put them on par with business class for unloading.  Nice.  The meals on the flight were good, there were lots of good movies and, as usual, they gave me one of those sleeper masks when I asked for it (in business it's automatic, but if you ask in economy you'll get one).  Upon arrival in Vancouver I saw a rare sight, the customs area was packed!  A cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to.  Not to worry, though, as just as I approached the line they opened another area of inspectors...and in about 10 minutes I was picking up my bags.  To top it off my cabbie spoke English (something that eluded me in Seoul and Vancouver much of the time) and we had a pretty cool conversation about life, marriage and cultures.  (He too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse you'll meet them...a little wisdom for you single-but-lookings out there.)  My phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect.  I forgot its charger and extra battery, and already ran down the old one...so that's the only blotch on this trip so far; which ain't too bad.  I've decided to start to teach him my limited French...which should keep him on his toes.  He's already got some of the accent down when he speaks baby-talk.           "
"             When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.  Now I know that this parenting thing is pretty tough.  The worst thing is they 'tag team' us.  For example, one stays up til 3:30AM, the other wakes up at 7AM.  One has a nap, and the other gets hungry.  And my wife isn't into lots of crap food for them, too...so she is constantly cooking and preparing wonderful delicacies like 'rice brocolli cheese tofu cakes' and 'seaweed and beef soup'--sounds great, eh?!  Well, the kids like it and I guess it's good for them.  When I go back to Seoul I know I'll miss these days (and nights) and start my old routine of 6PM rollerblading and going out to the bars on the weekends (maybe even during the week a bit, as my  urlLink CFA  test is finished for a few months).  I know the days will be a little less full without my 3-year old jumping (from the couch) onto my stomache/back/gonads...ah, how can I survive?  We will have the webcam and daily phonecalls to make things a bit easier, but it won't be the same.  Ug, so tired now...it's past 11PM and I know tomorrow will be busy...and the next day too.  My bud of almost 25 years is coming to visit and I'll make the trip to the ferry terminal to pick him up and the new place is now inconveniently 60 minutes from the docks compared to 30 minutes for our old place.  No matter, I imagine I'll relish the time alone on a simple car trip.         "
"             You may have noticed a new feature on my blog...it's a blog email notification thingy ( urlLink Blogarithm ).  All you need to do is put your email in the space and 'Keep it Fresh' and you'll get an email every time I update this blog.  I use this on blogs that I normally read (once I get better at code I'll actually have them posted on this page too) and find it pretty handy.  The last few days have been pretty hectic.  Basically in the pool (our complex's or the public one) everyday and running around with the kids and not getting a lot of sleep.  My wife and I take turns (one was up til 3AM last night, the other awoke at 7AM)...man, getting back to Seoul and my bachelor pad will be like a vacation--no matter how much work I have at the office.  There they go again...gotta go.         "
"             Korea, especially Seoul, is pretty cool; and Canada, especially Vancouver is pretty cool too.  Here are a few things I will (and will not) miss:  Things to miss about Korea: being a celebrity (well, a little one, at least...just for being me); 100 kinds of ice cream at the local convenience store (and all for 500 won/USD 0.40); 7 24-hour convenience stores within a block or two of my place;  urlLink inlining/rollerblading along the Han River ; bars with no line-ups; bar-hopping to at least 2-4 places in a night; Korean people; not worrying about water on the floor of my  urlLink fully tiled bathroom ; super-efficient  urlLink subways ; super-cheap  urlLink cabs  where the subways leave off;  urlLink no taxes ,  urlLink no tipping ; great food, and seconds for free;  urlLink alcohol  available at any store; eating  urlLink live octopus  (I mean live as in swimming around in a bowl/on a plate on the table); getting free fruit and/or tea and/or coffee and/or sugary drinks after every meal.  Things to miss about Canada:  urlLink no pollution  (or not noticeable, at least); good mixed drinks (like Dr. Pepper and Long Island iced teas, although that's changing in Seoul now); our complex's pool just 5 minutes away (and it's usually just us or a few people there);  urlLink burgers that are not served raw   (hellloooooo! heard of e-coli?).  Things not to miss about Seoul: drunk guys pissing in the streets at night (well, I am one of them sometimes); people always thinking I'm crazy for not liking tofu; paying like $10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers; having to go to the foreign food section to get my M&Ms.  Things not to miss about Canada: line-ups and cover charge at almost every good bar; larger Canadian chicks (hey, no flamings, please); union leaders who think someone should make $20 an hour to pick up trash when Korean 60-year-old men do it in Seoul for like $100 a month; Vancouver rain in the winter...and spring...and fall...and summer; high (14.5%!) sales  urlLink tax ; tips treated as if they are expected (no matter the service); having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles.         "
"             It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.  This makes sense because, as Koreans would, they decided not only to change the payment system but also all of the bus color-schemes, routes numbers and routes and even the structure of the roads in some areas of the city (see pic below of a fast lane for buses in one of the worst traffic areas of the city).  More in  urlLink this Korea Times article .   urlLink    Life in the fast lane.           "
"             This may be a long blog...got a lot of thoughts going through my head this last couple of days, not least because of my reading  urlLink A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market --a very cool book and one that I wish I read before embarking on the  urlLink CFA  designation exams (wrote 2 of the 3 required exams already).  Anyhoo, went out for some drinks last night (yes, Thursday night, a school night, but I really wanted to break this jetlag and I find that going out is one of the most effective, and most fun, ways to do so) at a little place called Han's Sausages near Hong-Ik University (usually referred to as HongDae).  So upon ordering the bratwurst and beer I noticed something interesting, the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape.  Pretty cool idea, and I had seen it before in another bar in Sinchon (another teen/bar district near HongDae).  While out on the town I started to think, 'What are the odds that I know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street?'  Likely pretty low, but then I remembered the last night I came here and got a call from an old co-worker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) in a little place that we almost went to (now that was interesting).  Then I remembered that a friend of mine's former girlfriend is in Korea--not Seoul, in Pusan. But her sister-in-law's friend is engaged to a Korean girl in Daegu who often comes to Seoul (HongDae/Sinchon specifically) to see friends.  So, what if one of the thousands of people I saw were one of those friends?  How many  urlLink degrees of separation   is that?  Two to the Pusan friend (or one, if you count that I know her now), plus three to the groom-to-be (or two as the Pusan friend already knows her sister-in-law) and two more to the friend(s) in Seoul.  So that's 4 to 7 degrees, not bad.  I could also suppose that the people on the street know my wife or one of her friends (as she went to school there) but we are older than these kids and it's not quite as interesting a story as going to Vancouver then Daegu then back to Seoul.  Another area: yesterday I met some guys from an asset management firm here (for business).  One spoke quite good English, and when he found out I was from Vancouver he noted that his brother-in-law is living here.  As well, the owner of the  urlLink &#49340;&#44228;&#53461;  (samgyetang, ginseng chicken soup) place across from my apartment has a home in a suburb of Vancouver. What are the odds of that?  Now let's deconstruct this a bit, and take a bit from my current reading (and suspend for a bit the idea that I have incredible selective memory and am merely drawing connections from random events).  On the beer: both restaurants were in the same relative are (more or less) and it makes sense that a seller of those dry-ice pitchers would service both of them.  For the people on the street: the university district is full of school kids, school kids are not (usually, especially in Korea) destitute poor and they are (by definition) educated (or nearso) and it is the well-to-do and educated that end up going to foreign countries and meet/marry foreigners (there are exceptions, just humor me for a bit).  Thus, it makes some sense that I (who knows many educated people in Korea and Canada, as I am one myself) would have an ok chance to have some connection with similar people in another country, no matter the whereabouts.  (This reminds me of when I spent a month in the Philippines with my bud Carlo who met a friend there who ended up being his distant relative. Especially in places where the economic/social strata is well-defined the 'top 1%' seem to flock together.)  Concerning the people who have ties in Vancouver.  Proximity is one factor, and wealth is another.  Vancouver is the closest airport to Seoul (one hour longer to go to San Francisco) and it also has an inviting climate and seems to attract the wealthy from many countries (including the U.S.).  So it makes sense that these, again, well-to-do and educated people would have some connection to my other home.  What's my point and how does it lead to a better understanding of Korean culture?  It's this: When you meet a Korean (or when they are  urlLink on their first dates ) they will always ask questions to  urlLink figure out if they have some connection  such as  urlLink age  and ethnicity or school ties or anysuch thing that could prove a connection.  For foreigners this kind of questioning is sometimes seen as rude, but this is just a part of Korea: you get used to it.  This is one reason that Koreans study their butts off to go to the best/largest schools such as  urlLink Seoul National University ,  urlLink Korea University ,  urlLink Ewha Women's University  and  urlLink Yonsei University  and then put themselves through incredible stress to get into major companies such as  urlLink Samsung Group .  It's because after all that study and hard work one will have instant camaraderie with fellow alumni and, thus, be able to move to Vancouver when they retire and not have to work selling dry-ice beer pitchers to every bar in Korea.         "
"             I've always thought of Seoul's  urlLink subways  as a real joy to be on. They are clean, fast, efficient(more or less) and CHEAP.  Buses, on the other hand, are a bit of a mystery to me.  I take one bus regularly, but that's it.   urlLink taxis , however, are plentiful, cheap and (once you know a little Korean) pretty easy to use.  Now things are getting a lot easier and logical.  As of today (July 1st) rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides.  This makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway (this doesn't happen in Vancouver).  The new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip.  As well, my phone will be able to house my T-Money so I don't need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or 'stored-value' ticket.  (It can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon! And carry up to 500,000 won, or about 435USD)There's also a color-coding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier.  Unless they have little maps on the buses I think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old, but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a city/district that covers many, many square kms.

"             Big cities are famous for being expensive places to live, some more than others, of course.  Here is the latest (2004,  urlLink source ) list of priciest cities to live in (sorry not sure how to format a table):                             1  Tokyo, Japan                         2  London, UK                           3  Moscow, Russia    4  Osaka, Japan    5  Hong Kong    6  Geneva, Switzerland      7  Seoul, South Korea      8  Copenhagen, Denmark    9  Zürich, Switzerland   10  St. Petersburg, Russia   11  Beijing, China   12  New York City, USA   13  Milan, Italy   14  Dublin, Ireland   15  Oslo, Norway   16  Shanghai, China   17  Paris, France   18  Istanbul, Turkey   19  Vienna, Austria   20  Sydney, Australia   21  Rome, Italy   22  Stockholm, Sweden   23  Helsinki, Finland   24  Abidjan, Ivory Coast   25  Douala, Cameroon   26  Amsterdam, Netherlands   27  Los Angeles, USA   28  Berlin, Germany   29  Hanoi, Vietnam   30  Shenzhen, China   31  Taipei, Taiwan   32  Guangzhou, China   33  Tel Aviv, Israel   34  Budapest, Hungary   35  Chicago, USA   36  Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam   37  Beirut, Lebanon   38  San Francisco, USA   39  Luxembourg   40  Düsseldorf, Germany   41  Glasgow, UK   42  Frankfurt, Germany   43  Munich, Germany   44  Bratislava, Slovak Republic   45  Jakarta, Indonesia   46  Singapore   47  Dakar, Senegal   48  Riga, Latvia   49  Prague, Czech Republic   50  Athens, Greece   51  Birmingham, UK   52  White Plains, USA   53  Brussels, Belgium   54  Kiev, Ukraine   55  Miami, USA   56  Barcelona, Spain   57  Honolulu, USA   58  Hamburg, Germany   59  Zagreb, Croatia   60  Algiers, Algeria   61  Madrid, Spain   62  Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates   63  Amman, Jordan   64  Kuwait City, Kuwait   65  San Juan, Puerto Rico   66  Casablanca, Morocco   67  Melbourne, Australia   68  Washington, USA   69  Lyon, France   70  Boston, USA   71  Lisbon, Portugal   72  Morristown, USA   73  Houston, USA   74  Almaty, Kazakhstan  75  Tallinn, Estonia  76  Warsaw, Poland  77  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  78  Manama, Bahrain  79  Sofia, Bulgaria  80  Auckland, New Zealand  81  Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  82  Ljubljana, Slovenia  83  Dubai, United Arab Emirates  84  Mexico City, Mexico  85  Atlanta, USA  86  Wellington, New Zealand  87  Brisbane, Australia  88  Adelaide, Australia   89  Toronto, Canada   90  Seattle, USA  91  Vilnius, Lithuania  92  St. Louis, USA  93  Leipzig, Germany  94  Perth, Australia  95  Limassol, Cyprus    96  Vancouver, Canada    97  Accra, Ghana  98  Cleveland, USA  99  Cairo, Egypt  100  Denver, USA  101  Detroit, USA  102  Monterrey, Mexico  103  Kingston, Jamaica  104  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  105  Portland, USA  106  Panama City  107  Winston Salem, USA  108  Guatemala City, Guatemala  109  Mumbai, India  110  Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei  111  Lagos, Nigeria  112  Pittsburgh, USA  113  Montreal, Canada  114  Calgary, Canada  115  Tianjin, China  116  New Delhi, India  117  Dacca (Dhaka), Bangladesh  118  Lima, Peru  119  Bangkok, Thailand  120  Tunis, Tunisia  121  Nairobi, Kenya  122  Tehran, Iran  123  Santiago, Chile  124  Ottawa, Canada  125  Lusaka, Zambia  126  Johannesburg, South Africa  127  Colombo, Sri Lanka  128  São Paulo, Brazil  129  Bucharest, Romania  130  San José, Costa Rica  131  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  132  Karachi, Pakistan  133  Chennai (Madras), India  134  Caracas, Venezuela  135  Blantyre, Malawi  136  Quito, Ecuador  137  Bangalore, India  138  Manila, Philippines  139  Bogotá, Colombia  140  Harare, Zimbabwe  141  Buenos Aires, Argentina  142  Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic  143  Montevideo, Uruguay  144  Asunción, Paraguay   Whew, that was long...I have to learn more about cutting code so I can make this thing prettier.  Anyways, Seoul is #7 and the first Canadian city is the 'Big Smoke' (as my Dad calls it), Toronto at #89 then my recent/dual hometown of Vancouver at #96 (I suspect it'll rise next year as real estate is on a bit of a tear lately).  Thing is, if you have the residence/home thing taken care of (as most teachers do in Korea) then living in Seoul/Korea can be pretty cheap.  Of course you can always spend $4,500 USD for a bottle of  urlLink Macallan 50 year-old whisky  at  urlLink SkyBar , but if you keep your head on straight it's not too bad.  Every morning I go to my local 7-11 and have 2  urlLink 삼각김밥  (sam-gak-gim-bab, literally 3-angled/triangle seaweed and rice) for about 1USD.  Today I splurged for a 새우버거 (say-oo/shrimp burger) but the price was still under 2USD.  (It's good for dieting too, as my wife near-constantly reminds me, because rice has 1/3rd the fat of bread and likely 1/100th that of a croissant, muffin or bagel.)   urlLink    My lovely breakfast.  Shrimp burger and triangle kimbap.         "
"             Koreans have a great sense of community.  So much so that sometimes they figure they can have a nap any old place.  Now I understand taking a snooze in a subway car (they are safer here) or taxi (done that a few times), but on some steps?  Well, it happens.   urlLink    I couldn't resist taking a pic of this guy...it was like 6PM and he was already sacked out on the front steps of a building in Sinchon (teen district of Seoul).  Notice his jacket is a step or so down from his resting place.  Must be nice to be in a virtually crime-free city.         "
"              urlLink    The business class tag for baggage.  I have to keep this in pristine condition for future flights.         "
"             I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi, kalbi and even lasagna).  Now, however, I'm getting pretty lazy.  Food is so good, plentiful and cheap in the restaurants (nevermind that Koeans love to go out to eat so if I did cook a large amount of food about half of it would go to waste anyways) that I've decided not to shop for anything more than noodles and booze.  (See photos for the result.)  Far from what I expected, I ended up losing weight and spending about the same amount of money, go figure.   urlLink    What a balanced diet I have...noodles and more noodles, tuna, gochoo jang (sauce).   urlLink    My fridge, the oranges are just for show, they've been in there for like 6 weeks.  Notice the contents: ketchup, mayo, orange juice (jeju-do) beer, soju, beaksayju, mayshilju, onions.         "
"             I often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional Korean cooking...then I saw this.  This place (not a good pic, it was from a taxi with my phone-camera) actually has a fire on the sidewalk right in front of it!  The guy is pickin out a red/white-hot brick for the patrons inside.  Only in Korea.   urlLink    Fire in the hole!         "
"             It feels like I didn't even leave this place, which is a little scary.  Things will be a little weird for a bit (as I take about a week to get over jetlag, unlike some people I know who take about 2 days) so postings may be a little sporatic for a bit.  As well, work is getting busier...which is fine my me.  It's kind of interesting, actually.  At this job we always have something to do (I do the weekly newsletter, research, presentations to clients, and liaise with our foreign partners) but there are definate lulls and busy times.  Just before my vacation was a lull, now we're back in the thick of things.  Speaking of thick, take a look at this pic.  Many days here are like this (although, admittedly, not this brutal).  Some are blue-skied, but even then you know that the pollution is there.  I left my windows upon when I went home and when I came back there was a thin layer of soot on the floor...hmmmm, that seems real nice, eh?  Now I know why my mother-in-law always cleaned the floor every day or so.  Apparently Seoul has DOUBLE the amount of particles (I'm assuming 'bad' particles) in its air.  Anyone who jogs here is nuts (but I, of course, do inline/rollerblade almost everyday, so I'm no better).   urlLink    Lovely Seoul smog.  One problem is the number of cars here, another is the level of industrialization and lack of environmental laws (or enforcement thereof) but there is also the polution that comes over from China (where things, from what I hear, are a lot worse) and the  urlLink Yellow Wind/Dust  that makes its way to our shores once or twice a year.  I was in one of these storms a few years ago (I was the only gomer without a surgical mask on) and I felt pretty weird afterward.  If you have a respiratory problem things could get ugly.         "
"             It's been a busy last couple of weeks, but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.   Didn't get near what I wanted to get done on this trip--had planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldn't get the time to get away at all.  A few friends made the trek up to our place, though, which was cool.  It's nice to see friends you've known for 10-20 years after being away for a while.  One guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying (as soon as he gets the familial blessing) a Korean, so my wife and I gave him the 411 on Koreans and ways to do things.  (More on that when I get back to Seoul, and have more time.)  Got to go now.         "
"             A night out in Korea can seem pretty overwhelming, especially in HongDae, Kangnam Sinchon,  urlLink Sincheon , Itaewon, Daehak-ro or any of the other major hotspots in town.  Hongdae, Sinchon and Daehak-ro make a name for themselves by being close to the major universities; Kangnam is a place for lavishing high-priced liquors and girls on clients; Itaewon is near the US Army base, so it's a haven for GIs and other English-speakers (who seem to have more money than brains sometimes, myself included) and Sincheon is a teen district as well, in the well-to-do area of Songpa-gu.  My latest foray was to Daehak-ro (daehak/daehak-kyo means college/university, ro means street).  We went to a ddak-kalbi (grilled chicken) place and saw a group of 3 guys whooping it up Korean style (copious amounts of soju and food and louder speaking).  One was pretty funny. I don't know if he was doing it for my benefit or to show-off to the Koreans around him (Koreans sometimes show that they know English as a form of one-up-man-ship...it shows they are educated and studied a lot, no matter how brutal the usage).  He was saying such things as 'Excuse me, could you calm down?' (actually, he said that A LOT) and 'I'm sorry' and 'Okay!'.  I think he was practicing to be a bar bouncer or something.  Anyways, these guys got pretty loaded.  When one of them was away from the table it looked like the other two were a little amorous (Korean men sometimes hold hands or put their arms around each other, especially after a gallon of soju).  I snapped the picture below before we left.       urlLink     2 guys who really like each other (but they are not gay).   Then when we finished walking nature was calling me...but not #1.  I took a look into the  urlLink hwa-jang-shil  (bathroom) in the restaurant, but it was a squat-type.  Then we came across this theatre (below...oh, and Koreans usually pronounce theatre and Seattle the similarly).  It was new so I took a look.  Man, that bathroom was spotless--maybe it looked so good because I figured that all of the ones in the area were squatters or brutally dirty affairs, as they usually are in smaller, older buildings (man, how do these women do it?).  Anyways, that's the tip.  Look for the newest, hippest building (especially ones with Western food or themes inside) to find the best W.C. (another way Koreans denote watercloset).   urlLink     Fantaseum   Since Korea has millions (ten of millions, likely) of cellphones (handphones, as they call them) you'll find public pay phones only in a few places: the airport, the train/bus stations, major hotels and the subways.  (Well, I've seen them on the street sometimes, but not that often, and not when you need one.)   urlLink     phones   Another instance of Korean marketing gone bonkers.   urlLink Red Mango  is a major bing-soo (shaved ice garnished with fruit and stuff and then topped with yogurt or ice cream).  But the tagline for the firm is a little....well, weird 'Start loving myself!'.  When I explain it to people they really get confused.   urlLink     Red Mango  Another thing here that's funny is girls wear shirts that say '69', it's a brand here but they are oblivious to the hidden meaning (if you don't know I can't explain it here, this site is family-friendly).  Or church-going girls will have a Playboy scrunchie in their hair...not knowing who 'The Hef' is.  Koreans also have no idea the multitude of words we have for a part of the male anatomy (so the scene in  urlLink Austin Powers  where they say 'woody, Johnston, boner, balls, willi...) goes over most of their heads.  They have one word here for it  urlLink go-choo  (hot pepper), and they're pretty surprised to learn that their word for 'ward' in a city (dong) is also another euphemism for gochoo.   urlLink     And, to cap it off, in the subway there was a guy taking a snooze right on the floor.          "
"             Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork). Oh-gyup-sal is a one-up on sam-gyup-sal (three layers of fat porl), so it only makes sense that this land of hyperbole would come up with chun-gyup-sal (1,000 layers of fat pork)--and it did.  As amazing as it may seem, someone got the great idea of leap-frogging all of the competition and calling what is basically pork chop a name that denotes something a little more superlative.  Why not trillion layers of fat pork (jo-gyup-sal)?  I have no idea.   urlLink     The sign says '1,000 layers of fat pork'...mmmmmmm.   Well, Korea isn't the only place where things get blown out of proportion sometimes, it's just that they do it so well here and we're not used to it.  Who can forget the launch of the  urlLink Gilette Mach 3 ?  Yes, that's what I need!  Three blades on my face!  (Of course they had 'Excel' versions of their Sensor, Mach 3 and ladies' razors, too, as if we needed that little white strip to save from cutting our faces open.)  Recently the  urlLink Schick Quattro  came out (for those of you who failed Latin, Italian, Audi or whatever language this is in: quattro means expensive).  Now Gillette has a 'power' version of its razor.  Now this is getting ridiculous!  Here in Korea I get 10 good razors for 2,000 won (USD 1.75).  (Yes, 17.5c each!)  They're so cheap I only use them twice then throw them away.  (Please no Greenpeace/eco-friendly group flamings.)  And you know what?  I get a pretty good shave out of it, too...similarly I only buy plain ol' pork chops at home.         "
"             Sometimes this place really makes me think.  So many things are so different here (language, expressions, people, culture, shopping, driving habits) but, yet, some things are just like home.  Take my building, for instance, there are a few guards (we call them 아저씨, ajeosshi, or 'mister') in the lobby...well, they're no so much guards as they are greeters, like at Wal-Mart (neat article  urlLink here ).  After they figured I was not a visitor, but a long term resident of Seoul they started saluting me, waving and saying 'Morning'.  Huh, morning?  Ok, I guess they learned that greeting somewhere. Many Koreans in lower-level jobs know absolutely no English and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten, so I appreciated the effort.  Then I was inline skating (rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily) one lovely 4AM and another 아저씨 said 'Morning!'.  Ok, that's two.  Interesting.  Then I got to thinking (well, it came to me while watching a Kia ad) that Morning is everywhere in Korea.  This morning (there I go again) I saw a give-away paper called 모닝 (Korean phonetic of morning) and then recalled the ad for  urlLink Kia's sub-compact car .  A simple search on Google Korea came up with more: an  urlLink online bookstore , an  urlLink online flowershop , a  urlLink golf site  and a  urlLink news organization .  Then there's  urlLink Good Morning Shinhan , one of the largest secutities dealers in Korea--with its flagship building in Yeouido, one of the largest in town and flaunting its name, albeit in Hanguel/Korean text, for all to see.  And, of course, this is the 'Land of the Morning Calm'. I could go on, but you get the point.  'Morning' is not without it's detractors, though.  About a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors.  One lady summed it up well saying, 'Now I know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day.' Definately not a good morning for her.  As an aside, apparently another Western idea is hamburgers, and in NORTH KOREA, no less.  (JoongAng Article  urlLink here .)  Here's your factoid for the day: although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original, Korean has incorporated about 10,000 English words into its language; much like Tagalog/Filipino has a lot of Spanish and we Westerners are comfortable with Bon Appetit and Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.         "
"             A readers will know, shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada, the US, UK...).  For one thing ( urlLink more things here ), you can haggle at almost every 'store' (and some for sure at every place that is not a store, but like the picture below). This includes the 'department stores' like Migliore, Doota and Hello ampm that are in Dongdaemoon (each area actually stalls of independent sellers) but not such high class/price places like Shinsegae or Lotte Depart.  There is also no haggling at Lotte Mart, LG Mart nor E-Mart, but in those places you're getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores.  Anyways, I find that haggling is a bit of an art...and it takes a little while to get the hang of it.  After a while you'll wonder why you don't get a discount back home, though.  (There is also  urlLink no tax  on purchases; it's either included in the price or just not paid--especially at street-sellers.)  Like today, I went to Namdaemoon for some shopping, had to get a few undershirts and towels.  I found a seller of both and asked the prices: 2,200 won for a shirt, 1,700 won for a towel...no discount.  Huh, ya, right.  I offered 16,000 (compared to the 16,800 total price...this is NOT a big discount, just 5%, but I was in a hurry and didn't have 5 minutes to haggle for $1.50 off).  She said, 'no discount' again, but I said (in Korean) 'I'm buying 3 of these and 6 of these, discount!' and she relented.  Oh, it helps if you can do simple math in your head (the seller sure as heck can) and if you know enough Korean to at least  urlLink say the prices in Korean .  Otherwise you're a bit of a mark.  Now for this picture.  This 'store' popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes.  No guarantee, but for $10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares?   urlLink     Get your ladies shoes right here!            "
"             Recently I downloaded Go-Stop (a traditional Korean card game, played almost exclusively by men, Yahoo!'s version is  urlLink here ) to my phone.  (There is one called Sexy-Go-Stop too, for those who are into Anime.)  Well, I've been playing it (the clean version) so much that my battery dies sometimes when I'm out (is this an addiction?).  The last time was out at the movie theatre (the MMC in Dongdaemoon is open 24 hours, if anyone is looking for a flick at 3AM).  A friend of mine said they have chargers at convenience stores (I also remember them at some restaurants too).  Then we found that they had them at the theatre, too.  The young kids there knew how to hook up the battery...they were really helpful, actually.  Koreans are so nice sometimes.  Here's a pic of what to look for if you're in Korea and your phone goes dead.   urlLink     You stick your battery in here for about 5-10 minutes and it's powered up (but the charge wears down more quickly, I think).   More things I like in Korea: delivery services.  I ordered a few books from  urlLink Seoul Selection  (a great foreign bookstore that has an interesting  urlLink newsletter  that's worth subscribing to--it's free).  Anyways I ordered online at 3:00PM. The order showed up at my door at 9:30 the next morning. This would not happen in Canada unless you paid extra for delivery, and even then it'd maybe be 2 nights as I ordered late in the day.  Korea, though has a ubiquitous number of  urlLink quick service delivery services  (as they're called).  This means it takes about 1-2 hours for a package to get across town because a motorbike courier takes it rather than taking it in a van to a sorting station then another van for delivery.  (It's similar to the bike couriers that we have in the West, but no one bikes on the roads here.)  I also like the way Korea updates things.  The pics below show one example.  In the old days there was a rarefied breed of warrior who guarded the main palaces and nobles, today there is another (decidedly more leggy) version.  (Um, this is a joke, for those who believe everything they read.)   urlLink     Changing of the Guard and Twirling of the Rifles.          "
"             One of my favorite places in 여의도 (Yeouido) is  urlLink Wingswing  located on the second floor of the building behind the Lexington (formerly the New Manhattan) Hotel.  It's run by the son-in-law of a Korean who spent 20 years in New York and Atlanta running similar places...and now the old man is here to revamp it.  They added 2 bar counters and hard liquor (and recipes) as well as more to the menus (spaghetti, quesadillas).  Last time I was there I had Crown Royal (oh, how I love it) and the time before they served us this Flaming Dr. Pepper which is a shot of Bacardi 151 in a glass of beer.  It's not as tasty as the version I know (Amaretto shot in a 50/50 beer/Coke mix) but not bad.  Probably one of the few places in Seoul you can get some of the booze this place has--and the only one in Yeouido.    urlLink     Flaming Dr. Pepper at Wingswing          "
"             Over the last few weeks I've been to a couple of Western movies ( urlLink Troy  and  urlLink Spiderman 2 ) and a few Korean ones as well:  urlLink 여친소 (Yeochinso/Windstruck) ;  urlLink 올드보이 (Old Boy) ;  urlLink 공공의적 (Gong-gong-ui Jock/Public Enemy ;  urlLink 와일드카드 (Wild Card) ; and  urlLink 범죄의 재구성 (Beomjwi-ui Jaegooseong/The Big Swindle) . I really liked all of the Korean movies (actually the Western ones seemed pretty predictable compared to the Korean fare) but found it interesting that 4 of the 5 (all but Old Boy) were cop movies. (To be fair, in The Big Swindle it was more about the robbers than the cops--still, the theme was intact.) Maybe this is typical to movies in general (going in phases, all of the movies are from the last year) or maybe it's just how (again) in Korea things are very much fads; where once a theme gets started it's difficult to stop it.    urlLink     Public Enemy, WildCard, The Big Swindle and Old Boy    With that in mind, I think of my night out on Saturday. A group of friends and I had dinner and a movie in the 동대문 ( urlLink Dongdaemoon ) area then headed to 대학로 (pronounced Daehan-ro, but the Korean spelling is Dae-Hak-Ro: Daehak means university, ro is street, so (as you may have guessed) it is a street near universities--so, of course, there are tons of bars there). It was raining as a typhoon is in town (see the  urlLink typhoon tracker page  for updates of when one is on its way here) so there weren't many people out on the town. (I, however, didn't mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and I was in shorts a shirt and cut-away sneakers...really quite comfortable.) We went to about 5 places before finding one called 꾼 (Kkoon, an intersting name). The gal running the place said it was their first business day, but the place was empty. The music, however, was really good so I said, 'Service.', as in: what will you give us to come in? She offered plates of snacks and such...sold! The prices were lower than I'm used to, too...a good place.   So, how does this connect? The ambiance. The bar was like many other ones out there with tables, low lighting, club music, and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers (we had 8 different kinds). I guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well, in which case you'll have lots of imitators.   I wonder what the next trend will be? Whatever it is, it'll catch on fast.  urlLink (JoongAng Ilbo article on this topic.)           "
"             In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians, heads of business) and follow (workers, students).  Don't get me wrong, Korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years (thanks mainly to the iron-grip of their president/dictator from 1961 to 1979, Park Chung Hee) and in the last 10 years (when Korea really started to open up to Western influences)--but things are still in a state of flux here.  Business practices have changed (although they retain much of the old flavour), politics...well, politics seems to still be the same..., relationships between people has changed (albeit only a little, Koreans still follow Confucius tenets and defer to age, men and the learned) and even language has changed (as the Internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words).  With these changes comes inefficiencies.  One can capitalize on them or be a victim.  The lady in the BMW below may have done both.  She is likely enjoying the ride in her Z4, but (according to  urlLink this newspaper article  she is also a victim of over-pricing--something that BMW, I assume, does not mind as they can have a higher profit.  (One other part of this may be that BMW has certain 'import duties' over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here, such is another inefficiency.)   urlLink     The BMW Z4...a pricey car in this town.   But what about those who cannot afford a luxury car, a flat in Kangnam (the priciest district in Seoul) and an expense account at the local watering hole?  Or worse, those who had it all and then lost it?  What happens to them?  Well, for some, the answer is suicide (hence my mention of  urlLink BASE jumping  (Buildings, Antennae, Spans and Earth) in the title.  Since there are few guns in Korea (heck, many policemen do a  urlLink Barney Fife  and don't even walk around with a loaded gun, the bullets are in their pocket!) the next best thing is jumping.  While inline skating one day near the river I saw police taking 2 jumpers from the water--ug,that was not cool.  Sorry for the imagery.  One thing that irks me about Korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters (one faux pas I probably just committed above).  We know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides, but they continue to report suicides as they happen.  Some of the stories are truly heart-wrenching and I (yes, even I) weep a bit when I hear some of them--this is not something you get desensitized to.  If you're of strong mind take a look at this article on recent  urlLink suicides .  Of course, it's not just in Korea.  In the  urlLink U.S. military suicide  is the #2 killer (I'm not sure if friendly fire or actual action are #1, you start to wonder sometimes).  The interesting thing I found from reading all of this (not that it makes me an expert by any means) is that Korea, although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 OECD countries, it was waaaay down the list globally (Korea always wants to be #1 compared to the top nations, which is why they probably used this statistic).  Countries in Eastern Europe (although some of these 'suicides' may be underworld related), Scandinavia, and even the US and Canada, Hong Kong and Japan had higher rates than Korea did in 1994.  (From Table 1 in  urlLink this paper/abstract  In true Korean fashion, the rates here went from 6.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 16.5 in 2000 and 18.1 in 2002...man, does everything here have a  urlLink logarithmic curve  to it?  Some also turn to  urlLink murder , such as happened 10 years ago and lately again (and I'm sure there were other cases in-between), but that's another story.  Perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on.          "
"             Koreans have an interesting saying when referring to guys like me: 기러기아빠 ( urlLink gi-reo-gi  a-ppa, wild goose dad).  Whenever I told Koreans that I was here and my wife and kids are in Vancouver they would call me this, and now I know why.  My boss explained it to me quite well (although he called the bird a  urlLink seagull , as many Koreans do).  It goes like this: a goose flies very high in the sky (so does a vulture, but I guess that's not as poetic, nor as flattering) and has very good eyesight.  Therefore, it can see things waaaay in the distance--which is good, because that's where a 기러기아빠's family is...across the ocean.  It is used for Koreans who go abroad to work, as many do in the Middle East on the many Korean-lead construction projects there, for the many families that have the wife and kids in a foreign place (especially Canada, especially Vancouver...there are so many there) and the dad stays in Seoul, and for guys like me who come to work but whose wife likes Vancouver soooo much she can't bear to live in Seoul and put the children through such torture as is living here.  It's just another part of Korea where things that don't make a lot of sense at first seem to be clearer once you get the whole story.   urlLink     The majestic, beautiful Canada goose.          "
"             This  urlLink Korea Times Business Section editorial  speaks of Jwa Seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the Federation of Korean Industries) 10 mysteries of the Korean economy.  #1 Western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the Korean economy.  #2 Seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development.  #3 The rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities.  #4 Income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies.  #5 Competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol.  #6 Economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power.  #7 The exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools.  #8 Government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization.  #9 The Roh administration seeks to scrap the Park Chung-hee’s economic development model, which created the Miracle on the Han River. #10 The government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness.  To this business/economic list I'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern Korean culture, if I may.  #1 Koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 Many Korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry Koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (N.I.M.F.T Not In My Family Tree) #3 Everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of Korea. #4 Koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 Korean students hate learning English, but older ones seem to love taking English classes. #6 Even after years of incredible progress Koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the Rodeo Drive of Seoul, the Silicon Valley of Korea, the Harvard of Korea. #7 Most Koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward U.S. soldiers here (especially those who served in KATUSA-Korean Army Training with U.S. Army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave South Korea vulnerable). #8 Koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 Koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 Many Koreans have dogs as pets, but many other Koreans eat dog!  Another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. A group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on.  The kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they ALL stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks.  Unreal.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.         "
"              urlLink     Paris Lovers...what a happy couple.   Looking at Korea one can see something of a Leave it to Beaver mindset when it comes to relationships--especially in the minds of 20-something girls here.  One could compare it (as I will) to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home.    Thankfully, some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume.  Recently I watched  urlLink Hi, Dharma!  ( urlLink a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery ) and  urlLink In-eo Gong-ju  (literally means mermaid princess, but is translated to My Mother the Mermaid or Little Mermaid; a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love).  Dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the (relative) purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters.  Both learned that their so-called 'pure' states (of peace or brutality) are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another.   The daughter in Mermaid had a revelation as well.  She hated her parents (her father seemed a dim-witted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubber/masseuse at a bathhouse).  She wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend.  An odd occurrence (I still don't know how this happened) put her back in time to when her parents met on  urlLink Jeju-do  where her mother was a diver (mermaid connection) and her father a postman.  She comes to see them in their innocence and pure state--full of dreams and potential; not the broken and bitter people they became.  A picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle, smiling.  The daughter asks her mother why he is smiling...and in the last scene her mother says, 'Of course he is smiling, what else could he be doing?' (or words to that effect).  Yes, the young have every reason to smile.   urlLink     My Mother the Mermaid and Hi, Dharma!   Mermaid seems to show that the 'pure' state of youth and promise is a transient one and Dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good (adding another dimension for growth).  This is something that some young people here don't seem to grasp...they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family (which means grandsons for many parents and in-laws).  Perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the Kims/Joneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife.  Of course, if they don't marry the perfect person Koreans can now  urlLink get a divorce  quite easily...which is another problem.         "
"             I must have been nuts.  Every 2-3 months I take off to Canada for 1-3 weeks.  My latest trip ended in late June, and I ended up getting into Incheon on Sunday (June 27th) evening...just missing the Canada Day party.  (Canada Day is on July 1st, but they staged the party early so it'd land on a holiday.)  Last year it apparently sucked and the beer was OB (local brew), not a Canadian lager so I thought I might not be missing much.  Man, what a mistake that was (as you can see from the pic below).   urlLink     Canadian guys chugging beer...Canadian gals striking a pose. Click to see larger version.

"              Just so you know, this blog isn't about being political. If anything, it's about as apolitical as you can get for blogging. However, there is something that I wanted to comment on: you can use it to form your views or not. Oh, and I talk about some of the important points in here, so if you're going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later.    Last night I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  (click for a  urlLink local review  and a trip to the  urlLink warroom ). It was a pretty good film. I had seen a few clips from it so I had an idea of what to expect, which was kind of unfortunate. Some said 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and I think knowing that dampened the mood a bit. It may have been better if I didn't know what to expect (and, sorry, now you know kind of what to expect so I opened a bit of Pandora's Box for you too).   When getting the required popcorn and drinks (5,000 won, 4.50USD for a large tub and 2 drinks!) I was greeted by this guy (below). I had to say, 'That's quite a get-up you got there', knowing/hoping he wouldn't understand. At the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in. I didn't think about them again until the end of the movie.    urlLink      Soon he'll be wearing a different uniform.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was a pretty interesting show. It tweaked a few memories I had from that day. When it happened I was in bed in Vancouver, just waking up. As a stockbroker I was wired to the daily news and had turned on my T.V. at 5:50AM. The news of the first plane was already broken and I was thinking, 'What the heck? Some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world? Was it a terrorist?' When the second one hit I think we all knew that it was no accident.   I watched it all that morning. Waiting for the fires to be brought under control; or maybe for another plane to hit another tower. Who could tell what might happen? It was especially surreal for guys like me, I think (egotistical, eh?). My dream, as any guy in finance would have,&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be to be in Windows on the World (the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers) giving a high-powered presentation to the money-men of New York and the world. That dream seemed more like a death sentence now. I don't know what the emotion was, but you might say I was relieved that I didn't go to Wharton or have a CEO dad who might get me into that room on that day. Of course you didn't have to be a financier to be there, many blue-collar people (firefighters and police) and 'regular Joes and Janes' were there as well.   The next day I went to work. It was quite odd. There was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harbor-planes were absent. All I could think about was the day before. I still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to Earth so many times in the weeks following. It sure didn't help my spirits.   Back to the movie. I knew what Michael Moore was up to when he made this film. His previous works included: Roger & Me (where he went looking for the CEO of GM (Roger Smith) for answers why his hometown of Flint, Michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm) and Bowling for Columbine (where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the Columbine shootings). I saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers (part-timers with no benefits, low salaries, fired for small errors...hmmm sounds like Korea in some ways!). Now, I'm in finance, mostly of the idea that business is good, so even though I found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didn't really change my thinking much. (I think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time.) I knew that Moore would be going after Bush, but I had no idea how much he had on him (or at least how bad he could make him look).   Moore's 9/11 was, as a documentary should be, presented as a well-researched, factual and intellectual piece. It went into the histories of the major participants (although not much on Saddam and I was worried about how he said that Iraq never hurt an American: some of it smelled of hyperbole) and presented the facts in logical sequence. Then he threw in a curveball. He had a gal in there (a wife and mother) who, in the beginning, loved the U.S. and the armed forces a lot. She carried her American flag out each day to hang on the front of her house--careful NEVER to let it touch the ground. Later, after her son died, she hated what had happened in her country. I'll tell you the worst part was how she was given the news--it was OVER THE PHONE! I remember in  urlLink We Were Soldiers  the Army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab (delivered by the drivers, no less) as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job. That, I thought was a low point, but this story plumbed the depths.   Clearly, Moore was not trying merely to make President Bush look bad (he made virtually&nbsp;everyone--Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice--look unprofessional, but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera). He could have easily made the soldiers in Iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone (which, it seems, they did do at times, but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone). No, he went at things on a bit of a different tact. He personified not only the soldiers, but something more identifiable not only for Americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any country's armed services--he made a poster child of those who are left behind (temporarily or permanently) when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son.   The mother (pictured below) is the real story and storyteller here. President Bush is a major figure, Moore is the one who brought it all together, but its her story that hits home more than any other. No 9/11 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her family's loss. Her husband said it best, though, when he said, 'We are very sad to lose our son in the war, but we are more sad to know that families all over America are having the same thing happen to them right now.' (I'm paraphrasing from my fallible memory, but I think you get the point.) It's the families that suffer(ed) when 800+ troops were killed in Iraq. (We also can't forget the loss of those in WTC, a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in Presidential Briefings.)&nbsp; For some their will to support the President and perhaps America itself may have been broken. I thought of our popcorn-seller (above) and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war, trading one uniform for another. What if my son(s) were sent off without an imminent threat, as we had in WWII and other 'respected' wars? How could you be proud of a country that did that to its children?    urlLink      Who is the main character in Fahrenheit 9/11? President George W. Bush? Michael Moore? or the mother of a fallen soldier?    So, what is next? Will there be a sequel in a few years? Perhaps Fahrenheit 38 Degrees? (Meaning the parallel of latitude that splits North and South Korea, and translated to Celsius that's just 3.3 degrees--close to freezing, kind of a cold war, which is what we have here: a war, but no open hostilities.) I doubt, after all this, that Bush (or any U.S. President for the next while) has the political muscle to go after North Korea, and that's just fine by me. Heck, if anything happens Seoul is within range of the North's artillery (!), to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne (and if the U.S. says they don't have the capabilities I'm inclined now to think that maybe they do).   Some things are different in Korea. For one, the two Koreas are still, technically, at war. Only an armistice (or cessation of open combat) was signed, not a peace treaty. I read the North signed it but the U.S. declined to sign it--hearkening to Moore's idea that the military-industrial-political complex needs a 'constant state of high alert and confusion' to reach its aims (which are, mainly, focused on money).    I'm going to digress for a little bit here, sorry.  Much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war. For instance, the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford that former President Bill Clinton received was founded by  urlLink Cecil Rhodes : one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time (so much so that the country of Zimbabwe's former name is Rhodesia, named after him). He made him money from exploitation of South African diamond mines--a country which was finally conquered by the Boer Dutch in 1902, the same year Rhodes died. As well, the respected  urlLink Nobel Prize  was founded by Alfred Nobel who made his money from a little product he invented: dynamite/T.N.T. A technological triumph that is best known as 'the thing that makes things blow up', as an explosives expert might put it.    Back to Korea.  Here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves. A  urlLink recent article  reported that 74% of respondent to a survey of Koreans said they believe politicians are law-breakers. Maybe the same is true in the U.S., but 74% pretty much tells you that people here don't need a Michael Moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors. (I'm not sure if that is a good thing.)   The difference here, though, is the threat. As I said, there is still a war going on. South Korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an  urlLink 18-month jail sentence  for those who do not comply (of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company, so it's actually more of a life sentence). In the U.S. service is voluntary, it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers, but it is, in the end, voluntary. Those who are in the service and do not want to be (re-)deployed to a place like Iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment. Again, the difference here is North Korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the Koreas and they will take back the South; while Iraq did not make (according to Moore, I'm not sure about this point) threats toward the U.S. North Korea also does not have any resources (something that can't make the economy in that non-trading country very viable).   Anyways, this is a record blog length for me, and I'm glad you came along for the ride. My last word is simply that after Moore's 9/11 movie I think many people, myself included, will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars (if I may go so far as that) harder to do in the future...and that, I imagine, was its intent.            "
"             Korea is, as you may have guessed, a hyper-competitive place. Once a store, restaurant or whatever they always make a big deal of it. One of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls. Ya, you heard right. Girls in cheerleader-like outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort. It's really quite a sight. When my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things...his 20-year-old brain was probably about to overload. This display I saw in Namdaemoon as I did some light shopping (actually I needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat & humidity here these days). Have no idea what this store is, but I was sure tempted to take a look. (Guess the marketing works.)    urlLink      Welcome to the Grand Opening of...um...I forget...where am I anyways?    Then we have  urlLink Bricx , a little place I've walked past but didn't see a reason to enter...maybe now, however.    urlLink      I'm not one for anime usually, but this one...    It took me a while to read it correctly. Usually they say things like 'free drinks (upon paying cover of 20,000 won)' or something. I know  urlLink Ohoo/Hodge Podge  has free drinks for ladies on Thursdays from 10-midnight, but this one is a little more interesting. All gals in bikini tops get free drinks at Bricx on that night...hmmmm. I wonder what they'd do if I showed up in my bro/manzeer.   Finally, take a look at  urlLink Seoul Pub's  video on  urlLink 'Picking up in Seoul'  on  urlLink Seoul Scene's website . It's pretty corny...but mostly funny. The Aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there (I mean like every night, which is probably why he's featured so prominently).&nbsp; They've got another one called  urlLink Bondaegi Challenge  in which unsuspecting passer-bys are asked to eat....ready for this?...steamed silkworm larvae. It's actually quite well liked here.     UPDATE:   I didn't make it to the Bikini Party, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .            "
"             I was going to hold off on writing this until I had a ton of pics of some of the public  urlLink washrooms  they have here, but I had a pretty brutal experience in one today so I figured that was a sign or something. Here's a restroom to avoid: near Line 4 at Seoul Station Subway...unreal. As soon as I walked in I noticed the floor was dirty, which is normally ok, a little dirt isn't the end of the world. Then I noticed a pungent odor...really brutal, actually. If I didn't have to go so bad (#1) I might have bolted, but instead I just let it go...man, did I regret that. I tried breathing through my hanky, but it didn't work, the smell permeated everything. I was getting light-headed from lack of oxygen and barely made it out of there. Man, I think they cleaned that place last when Park Chung Hee was in power (1961-1979). Ugh!   Below are some interesting shot. Take special note that they were all taken from the hallway of the building, not inside the restroom. Thus, anyone walking by could not only see the empty stalls (which is a faux pas in the West as it is) but also the user of it if it is occupied. Some also have a fantastic view from outside, just in case you want two audiences.    urlLink      All of these pictures were from the hallway, not inside the actual bathroom!    The one below is interesting. This bar in Daehak-ro is the only place you can dance in the whole district (or so its sign says) but it's also the most interesting bathroom. There is a door/window right beside the urinal that opens out to the alley. It lets in a nice breeze, but makes one feel like a bit of an exhibitionist.    urlLink       On the left:  that's a door/window that looks into an alley...and anyone can look in.  On the right:  in Lotte Department Store there is a bathroom manager and worker...posh!    Many buildings have bathroom attendants but here they not only have a check-list sheet (as they have in the West in many places) but also the picture of the attendant that cleans it (I guess in case you want to pick them out of a crowd: 'Hey, don't you clean my office's bathroom?') and in the one above there is a 'manager' and attendant responsibile for the cleanliness of the washroom. If only they were at Seoul Station on Line 4's, I might not have almost lost my lunch.             "
"             Ah,  urlLink the monsoon season has ended  and thus begins the  urlLink dog days of summer  on the peninsula. I promised myself that I'd never be in Korea (and especially in Seoul) for this, but it looks like I'll be here for about half of August. Oh...my....God! It will be so hot.   Many Koreans take this hot weather as  urlLink an opportunity to take time off  (what with the continued fazing in of the 5-day workweek here) and have some ice cream (there are so many awesome flavors here, priced from 500-1000 won, or just 0.45-0.90 USD!).   Of course Koreans have a penchant for doing the moderately illogical as well. Today the owner of a 한방삼계탕 (han-bang-sam-gye-tang, extra healthy ginseng chicken soup) place ( urlLink not this one, but close ) came by the office. I actually was able to use my pitiful Korean to confirm that his place is in the basement of some building and that the price was 8,000 won (7USD, not bad). Then a friend of mine said it must be because we are in 초복 (cho-bok) or the start of the dog days. Anyways, as you may know, Koreans have 2 things they need in life: to be warm and to be well fed. Samgyetang is served literally boiling hot (they even have special stoves to fire up the bowls) so you'd think it's best served in the winter...oh no...Koreans love it best in the summer (as if it's not hot enough!). Well, this is Korea, so I'll likely have a burning bowlfull at lunch with the throngs. (When I asked why Koreans like hot food in the summer the only response was: because it's good for your health.) It'll make the air conditioned office that much more inviting.  Oh, and another reason they call it the 'dog days' is they like to also have 보신탕 (boshintang) or dog soup. Yup,  urlLink they eat dogs here (read story if you've got a strong stomach) . It's the typical Korean food reasons: it's good for men's stamina (as in: stamina between the sheets, the only kind they care about) and for women's skin (gals here are a little preoccupied with good skin). Many guys, especially older ones, and 'talents' (which is what they call any celebrity, star, singer, actor) dine on dog in order to excel in bed or in front of the camera.         "
"              urlLink Samsung has a new phone ...with a THREE megapixel camera.  LG and Panitec/Curitel have similar ones out as well.  The only problem is the things are about 700,000 won (600USD).  So, I'll wait a bit until I get a new phone/dica (digital camera, as they abbreviate it here).  For now, I'm having fun taking pictures of interesting things I see in this crazy place.  Like this address plate.  It says: 21, Yangmalsan, 5 gil or: building 21, sock mountain (area) 5th road.   urlLink     Building address in Yeouido aka Sock Mountain.   I asked my boss (pictured below) about why the heck a road is called Sock Mountain...it didn't make much sense, even for this place.  He told me that Yeouido use to be called Sock Mountain...why?  No idea.  Now the place is full of investment houses, the National Assembly (parliament/senate/capitol building) and (following the money) bars and brothels...no sock factories.    urlLink     My boss mixing SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY and Korean beer.   The whole office went out last night for &#50724;&#44217;&#49332; (oh-gyup-sal, or 5-layers-o'-fat-pork).  We have a new company member and, true to Korean form, that's a great excuse to have food and (a lot of) drink.  My boss, please forgive him, brought the bottle of 1950 Macallan single malt Scotch I got him on my last trip back and then (oh my God, I can hardly believe he did this!) proceeded to fill shot glasses with it and drop them in glasses of OB (Oriental Brewery, a local malt-maker) lager.  Unreal.  Now, my grandfather worked for Seagram's (and has Scottish heritage) and two of our suppliers are right from Scotland and if they saw such a travesty they probably would have throttled him--hence the pixelated face, a little taste of the witness protection program tactics he'll have to face for such an injustice to Scotsmen everywhere.  (Oh, FYI, only single malt whisky from Scotland can call itself 'whisky' minus the 'e', all others are properly spelt 'whiskey'.)  Good thing I had my cameraphone at the ready to take these breathtaking shots, eh?         "
"             It's been a while.  Been busy.  Was entertaining a British friend of mine (originally from Manchester, now in K.L.-Kuala Lumpur) who has basically been ruined by Asia.  You see, once a Western guy comes here he can hardly go back to life in the West...you'll know if you're here.  Two other Aussie brothers I know had the same thing--they both work for investment banks in Seoul and Shanghai and speak the respective languages, to life is good for them, too.  (Same effect for Korean women who go to places like Vancouver, they can't bear to leave that place either.)  Anyways, his business partner (an Aussie) was in town with him too...first time...so we went out for a few nights.  Also, some American and a Dutch friend of mine and some Koreans wanted to go out too...and then a couple of nights for business...like I said, been busy.  We went to DaeHak-ro and had &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa; seo=west; pi=(pi)zza; dong=east; pa=(pa)-jun, a Korean kind of omlette; together they are western pizza/eastern omlette) and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452; (dong-dong-ju,a kind of immature makkoli, or rice booze).  Man, was it goood.  The dong-dong-ju, it looks like porridge but tastes light (the porridge look is actually ice crystals held in the mixture, no idea how they make it so consistent).  On the way out I almost invariably take the subway.  It's fast, clean, convenient and is unaffected by the recent torrential downpours (it's monsoon/typhoon season here now).  It's interesting, some stations are a little micro-city with shopping areas (some really large), links to office and apartment buildings, restaurants and almost everything else.  They all have a few things in common: lockers (which I wondered about before, but now I've used them a few times to store things I bought--and at about $1 a day they're a pretty good deal), payphones (something you don't see a lot of overground), washrooms (some are better than others), a lotto booth and usually a little convenience store, gift shop, flower shop and/or food seller.   urlLink     Amenities: lockers, PC bang, escalators.   I don't know why, but many of the subway stops here are spruced up a bit.  They have things like (below) lighted signs on the air conditioner units, aquariums (they call them fishbanks here) and posters for the Seoul Subway Corp. that show scenes totally unrelated to subway travel.   urlLink     Subway Art: an air conditioner, a fishbank and a Seoul Subway Corp. poster   There's also art shows sometimes.  There was one for international children's art this weekend at Hyehwa station: I saw 2 good ones: one was from China and another one (aptly named Snow in Canada) was from my home country.  Ahhh...a little piece of home.   urlLink     World Children's Art: China and Canada   That's it for now...later.           "
"             Man, it's been busy lately. Out every night working (here that means having drinks with friends, clients, suppliers and partners (business partners, that is, I'm not into the girlfriend scene). Thus, all I've got today is  urlLink a link to this other blog . Some funny scenes from the Seoul Subway system. Enjoy.   Oh, and  urlLink as I reported earlier , Bricx Bar had a Bikini Party last Friday. I didn't make it there, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .          "
"             Ok, you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is. It's tenuous, but here goes. First, these are four countries I likely will not drive in (although I did drive in the Philippines, or Phil, but that was in my younger days) the first three because of the amount of nuttiness I've either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because I don't think I'd spend much time away from the beach.   Ok, so about this Korean driving stuff. I've been here for almost 2 years and always get the question: 'do you have a car?' My answer, I think, is pretty logical. No, because (i) the subway system here is cheap, easy and pretty fast (no traffic); (ii) the bus system is not prefect, but once you know which one to take it's quite nice; (iii) our firm has a driver and  urlLink Hyundai   urlLink Equus  for visits on company business; (iv) taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive; (v) my work is like 20 meters from home; and (iv) driving here is not like in Canada (either I'd cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when I drive back home). Thus, no need for a car. Actually, I try to stay off the roads whenever possible here.   Perhaps this is for good reason, Korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developed/developing world. It's really quite amazing. Take a look at these articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and you'll see what I mean. One reason is  urlLink many Koreans do not use seatbelts  (another article  urlLink here ). Even I don't, when I'm in the back seat--especially of a taxi. It's really quite odd (and scary) that I always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when I'm here...perhaps simply because everyone does it here.   People who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road, as described in  urlLink this article  from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. And if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect (more on that  urlLink here ).   So, what's the connection to Greece?  urlLink Korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in Greece . I'm not sure why, it certainly isn't valid in Canada, you have to do a new test and everything there, but for some reason Greece has opened the doors for Koreans to take to its streets, probably because of the Olympics. ( urlLink Apparently Greece is famous for some crazy driving as well .) But then, isn't that a brutal time for Koreans (or any foreigners) to be tooling around town in a rental? Oh well, I'm certainly not going to Greece anytime soon, and if I did I'd probably call  urlLink George the Super-Cabbie .   So, on to Phil. I went there with a bud in December 1998 (most of this file is classified, so this'll be short). One of the highlights was driving from  urlLink Cebu City  (where Ferdinand Magellan was  urlLink beheaded by King Lapu Lapu  way back when) to  urlLink Moalboal , the noted diving spot. It was about a 3 hours trip on provincial (read: rural, goat/dog/child/rickshaw-strewn) road and on the way back Carlo was at the wheel. For some reason a dog was on the road and Carlo tried to avoid it (really, he did swerve like 3 times, the thing just changed direction again!) but, in the end, it became one with the rubber. Also, a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us (I hope it was a toy, but you never know). With that I started to really question why I'd be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in Phil or any other developing country.   Carlo and I returned to Canada safely and got back to work at  urlLink RBC Dominion Securities  where we worked (did I note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase?) but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms. I was in Canada a while longer before coming here and Carlo went to first  urlLink Turks & Caicos Islands  then to  urlLink Cayman Islands . He left then returned to RBC and, as you can see from the pics below, is an avid flagger, I mean flag football player.  Ya, he goes long on the field and goes short in the office.  (haha! a little finance/hedge fund humor there for ya!)   urlLink     Watch out Carlo! Looks like that big dude's got your number! Good thing it's flag football.    Right now he's Player of the Week! Way to go Carlo! His profile is  urlLink here  and his league's site is  urlLink here  (Carlo, why is the domain dot K-Y??). Oh, and ladies, too late, he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way.    urlLink     Lookin' a little rotund there, Carlo.   Well, that's the story, from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog.          "
"             I'd like to thank my bud Peter in Vancouver for the picture below. It shows me that it's  urlLink not just Koreans  that are into voyeurism (although the Swiss version has one-way glass so people can't see in, and the Korean versions have none such discretion, it seems).    urlLink      Is it me? Or does she look like Martha Stewart? And doesn't that look like a prison cell loo?    I was out last night on a 회식 (hwi-shik), which basically means a bender with guys from the office. We went to my favorite local haunt, Outsider. It's called a 'playing bar' in English but in Korean they call it a 양주이밴트바 (yang-joo ee-ben-t-ba, whiskey event bar). Basically, it's not a room salon but it's nicer than a regular hof (or local Korean pub). There are girls pouring the drinks but they are ALWAYS on their side of the bar (which is just fine by me).   Of course that wasn't all that we did. We had 삼겹살 (3-layer fat pork, much like backbacon) first and went to WA Bar (when you say the name it sounds like the Korean for 'come here', very apt methinks) afterward. Man, I love living in Yeouido...at least I can get home within 50 steps instead of taking a bus or cab for 20-60 minutes to get home. Sometimes I think I'm a little spoiled here...but then I remember the pollution, long hours and compulsory drinking and I figure it about evens out.    urlLink      Um, where's his other hand!??!    So, anyways, this morning I got out of bed at about 4am to do laundry (wild and crazy guy that I am). I was still drunk, obviously, and ended up not checking my shirt pocket for the namecard (that's what they call business cards here) of the new guy (the one on the left in the pic; the middle guy, Yoon, is our new recruit and the guy on the left is Jo-last name-by the way, I think Jo should have the English name of Danny or Daniel, what do you think?). So, it got washed...damn. Well, at least I know what he looks like. Him, Yoon and I are all born in the same year, but I am a few months older, so we can be friends. It's odd here, even a year or so difference and you're considered on a different plane in some respects. Jo is our junior...so we have to take care of him/get him plastered. The nice thing about being a little older is I can pull rank and make everyone drink. hahahaha! But as a 외국인 (way-gook-in, foreigner) I can also claim to be untouchable (in the good sense) if I don't want to do something. hahahaha! (But I usually do it because it's not a good idea to play the race card too much here.)   I had to get myself some coffee this morning, but felt cheap (as usual) as there is wonderful  urlLink Maxim Mocha Gold  sticks in the office. I'm sure these things are killing me slowly, but they're just sooo convenient! Also heard that  urlLink Starbucks just opened their 100th store in Korea  (in Itaewon, actually). Yesterday was it's 5th anniversary in Korea...and I remember when I first came here (about 5 years ago, actually) they were just starting. In typical Korean fashion they caught on like wild-fire (foreign, expensive, addictive...what's not to love?)   One last thing. Koreans have a special numbering system for counting things, but they can't do the same in English, it seems. They seem to think that 'th' comes after every number. My namecards say that we are on the 2th floor...well, we're not, the 치과 (chi-gwa, dentist) is on the first floor. Then today on T.V. I saw an electronic device that was labeled '2rd cable port'...at least they were trying on that one.             "
"             Last night I saw  urlLink Silmido . Man, it reminded me of The Dirty Dozen. The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded).   The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated.   The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war.    urlLink     Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction.    At least The Dirty Dozen achieved their mission...but it was just a story, maybe based on Silmido, who knows?          "
"             Yahoo! Finally, after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal. I had almost given up on this place/market, but looks like we've go our foot in the door. Never give up is the motto here. Reminds me of a client of mine I had in Vancouver. I knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area, but it took 2 years to get an account out of him...for $500,000. He said to me three words I'll never forget: persistance beats resistance. Man, what a lesson that was.   A friend of mine from  urlLink Geoje-do  (cool blog about teaching experiences on Geoje-do  urlLink here ) came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the Island. One (Andy) has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 VIP tickets to the  urlLink MTV Buzz Asia Concert  (sponsored by the super-cool  urlLink iriver  company-article  urlLink here ) at Chamshil Indoor Stadium (which I think is the same as the  urlLink Jamshil Auxiliary Stadium ). Thanks Andy!   I had no idea it would be so packed. We got there just after 7PM, when it started. We read the part on the ticket about first come/first served, but missed the line about 'doors will be open at 4pm'. Whoops (Koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon, knowing them). Well, the place was full, but our VIP friends were already in. The gal (Anne) came out and (owing to her sister who works with the Prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade) she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasn't already full. Thanks Anne!   The acts were pretty cool. We missed the first one,  urlLink 보아/BoA  but caught the rest. Take a look at the pics below of BoA,  urlLink Jaurim  and  urlLink Shinhwa . For all the boy bands/acts I tried to get the most masculine pictures I could for my site, but if you want fruitier ones they're all over their sites. (I sometimes wonder about these guys, but at least the girls are hot.)    urlLink      BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa.    There were a few J-Pop and Taiwanese acts too:  urlLink Namie Amuro ,  urlLink Vanness Wu  and  urlLink Wang Lee Hom . There were a couple of others, but the names were in Chinese and I'm feeling a little lazy now.    urlLink      Namie Amuri, Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom.    So, as you know, Koreans love to get together and eat and drink, that's why the after-party was so cool. It was in the uber-tony area of  urlLink Apkujungdong . It's home of the highest priced real estate (and women) in all of Korea. Yes, I'm sure I saw many genuine Fendi bags and plastic bodies. The best part was the 2 free drink tickets. Ah, there's the Scot in me speaking again. The next day we hung out in lovely  urlLink Yeouido Park  (another review  urlLink here ) where we fed the birds (below). It reminded me of the flocking to the afterparty/bar/dancefloor the night before...birds of a feather and all that.    urlLink      The gatherings: concert, afterparty, in the park.      urlLink Here's another flocking ...of Koreans to the beach in Pusan. I think the caption says there are 1,000,000 people there at the beach (about 2/3 of the population of the Vancouver area). I wouldn't put it past them.   And my final comment on this topic: credit cards.  urlLink This article  on how Koreans were lured by the notion of 'easy money/credit' (fanned somewhat by the card companies' desire for market share at any cost) and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals (sadly, many of also 'succeeded' in passing on their debts to their heirs, as happens here when a debtor dies).          "
"              urlLink As promised yesterday , last night I saw a Korean horror movie:  urlLink 분신사바/Bunshinsaba .  First, though, there was time to kill before the movie so a little sam-gyup-sal was in order. We went to Don Don Restaurant in Jong-no (downtown) where there was an interesting concept. It's on the fourth floor and is entirely open-air...but they still had fans and air conditioners on full blast, too. Also, the condiments (쌈장/ssam-jang or bean paste, 상추/sang-choo or lettuce, 미역국/mi-yok-gook or kelp soup and other goodies that are hand-delivered in most restaurants were self-service after the initial place-setting. This was cool for me as (i) I love 쌈장 and 상추 with my pork and (ii) we were seated  right  next to the buffet. They also cut the pork right in front of you (Koreans are always trying to differentiate themselves, especially regarding food). Trouble is, it kinda reminded me of  urlLink Lorena Bobbit ...dooough!  Next stop was ice cream at LG25 (LG's answer to 7-11...is it really open 25 hours a day?) and try my hand at shooting a Gatling gun. Not a real one, mind you, it shoots pellets. (I'd like to see how my G.I. buddies do at that one.) Of course, the place was staffed by 2 little Korean gals (all the better to lure in the men), one of which was a pretty good shot with the Beretta.   urlLink     Cutting the Pig; Shooting the Gatling; Scaring the Girls   They say that fear for Koreans is different from us Westerners ( urlLink see article ) but I think it had many similarities to the Western genre...although the setting and plot was a little different. I won't reveal too much, but let's just say that the director did a good job of creating a lot of suspense and fright in that theatre. There was one gal there who went just berserk at about every scary scene (especially in the beginning) and everyone laughed after each outburst. I think she was scared enough for the whole room. Hahaha. Just hilarious. Without that comic relief it would have been a lot scarier, I think.   urlLink     Scenes from the movie...walking...a hand...raising her face (!)...then the final scene...and afterward.   Some pics above from the film--sorry, figured out my zoom after the first couple, and the lighting, as you might imagine, was not optimal. The effects were minimal compared to I, Robot but very, very effective for this movie. Afterward I took a picture of a lighted billboard. The girl in the white dress wasn't there when I took it...she must be a ghost! Ok, that's a joke, but it sure sounds scary. 푸하하하!          "
"             I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.   urlLink     The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong!  And push-ups!   More pics on  urlLink the site  (it's all in Korean, but no translation needed for the images.  Now, I knew that Korean women are strong in spirit, but had not seen many like this.  Most Korean men like their gals to be smaller, weaker (well, most guys do, it's just more prevalent here) so it takes real...um....balls for a gal to go into this sport.  I don't mind it, myself.  Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty--at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey.         "
"             Seoul is a pretty good place for outdoor activities, as long as you live in the right part of town (which I do, thank you!). There are a few parks around but 2 of the largest are Olympic Park (a massive place that I lived near for 6 months when I stayed with my in-laws when I first came here...they were right in the '88 Olympic Village, which was nice) and Yeouido Park (which was like a parking lot before they revamped it and added trees and stuff).   urlLink     View of Yeouido Core; the park at 6AM one Spring morning...gorgeous; The Great King Sejong; and, to top it off, a guy sleeping in a gazebo.   Take a look at the scene above...this is like a block from my home and work. Before the office moved to this side of the park these views were my commute everyday...a 12 minute walk from door-to-door. Pretty cool, eh? Sure it costs a bit more to live in Yeouido and there isn't a Lotte Mart (Korean Wal-Mart) to be found in the immediate area, but it's real nice here, I think.  urlLink The Great King Sejong  is credited with 'inventing', or at least causing the invention of, Hanguel (the Korean alphabet, although it's not really an alphabet, it's more a set of sounds put to writing...very scientific for back then). His name and image is all over the place, especially at schools. There is also a  urlLink book store  and  urlLink securities company  named after him. And what stroll in Seoul would be complete without seeing a guy sleeping on the ground or floor (as reported before a few times). This guy looks prepared, though. He had the presence of mind to bring a mummy sleeping bag and get himself in the gazebo (and away from the early-morning dew that is so prominent here in the Spring).  For exercise, the little that I do here, I like to inline skate (as they call rollerblading here). Take a look at these shots:   urlLink     LG Twins Building, 63 Building, and Traffic!   Here's the lovely LG Twins Building (owned by LG Group, formerly Lucky Goldstar, also owner of the LG Twins baseball team; there are rumored to be anti-aircraft guns on the top of these towers to help defend Seoul); the 63-story tall &#50977;&#49340;&#48716;&#46377; (yook-sam (6-3) bill-ding) which houses &#45824;&#54620;&#49373;&#47749; (dae-han-seng-myung, Korea Life (Insurance), aka KLI by foreigners); and a couple views of how close you can get to the traffic on this path. It actually goes under the 88 (&#54036;&#54036;/pal-pal) Highway for a ways. Ya, probably not the cleanest place to workout, but it's all we got without going 1-2 hours from here. Many people actually drive 30-60 minutes to get to  here , especially on the weekends and holidays when this place is a madhouse. On Children's Day I got a groin injury from dragging my skate so much in order to slow down for the (literally) thousands of kids on the paths.  And why exercise?  Well, there are a lot of fun places in Seoul such as Bricx (click  urlLink here  to see the Playboy Party pics...man, think I have to check this place out; wet T-shirts involved, no minors) and good ol' Ohoo/Hodge Podge (some crowd pics  urlLink here ).  More tomorrow...going to see a  urlLink Korean horror movie  tonight (with subtitles), should be interesting.         "
"             Man, how do I come across some of this stuff. Anyways, there are a couple things that may help get my buds over to Seoul sometime soon (you know who you are). Many have threatened to come here, and some read my blog and may be on the verge, but this should about do it.  Here it is:  urlLink Seoul, home of the sexiest women on the planet . (Not that they have a chance at meeting them, but they are in the city limits, apparently.)  There's also the interesting theme parties they have at  urlLink Bricx Bar  in Itaewon. I've still never been to one, but the last one ( urlLink the Bikini Party ) almost got me there. The next one is a Jungle theme. Unga-bunga!   urlLink     Ok, she's not Korean...she may not even be in Seoul...but it's a mighty fine pic.   Of course if you do hook up with a Korean (especially a Korean gal) you may find yourself a victim of 'the Coupling'. I've heard it's only with married couples, but I suspect that boyfriends get roped into this look as well. Watch out.   urlLink     Beware 'the Coupling'.           "
"             &#49888;&#52492; (Sinchon, an area of Seoul near &#54861;&#45824;/HongDae, or the university district) is a pretty cool place.  From Yeouido the subway is pretty inconvenient, but there's is a bus that goes there and cabs are a cheap and fast option as well.  A few times, though, especially in this warm weather, I couldn't ignore the urge to walk the 45 minutes it takes to get there/home.  It's a nice walk: flat, across a bridge (usually some nice breezes blowing by) and you get to see more of the city and its people that way.   urlLink     Smoggy view; 2 black swans; impenetrable lock; stinky garbage (peeee-yew!)   The pics above are from a recent walk.  The first is a lovely view of Seoul's smog.  This is easterly; to the west the sky was clean (owing to the west-to-east winds from the West Sea) but it was too bright to take a picture of.  Below the bridge, and fairly numerous along the Hangang (Han River) are &#48177;&#51312; (swan) boats.  People paddle around in these things, but not too often.  (The mascot of Mapo-Gu, where Sinchon-dong is, is a swan; Youngdeungpo-ku, where Yeouido-dong is, has a duck sporting a necktie as its emblem.)  In the summer months people even sleep next to the river (well, not  right  next to it) fishing, eating ramen, drinking soju, talking...typical Korean stuff.  The odd spiral pic is that of a 'lock' on a gate next to a dilapidated apartment building.  You can see that not only is it easy to open, but the material is nothing more than thin wire.  I have no idea what or who this is supposed to guard against, but I guess someone had a reason for putting it there.  While walking back home I smelled something pretty putrid.  I mean really rotten.  God-awful, it was.  Then I stumbled upon the answer (thankfully not literally), this pile of decomposing trash.  Where's a garbage truck when you need one? Actually, I take that back.  Once in Daehang-ro a garbage truck passed by and let me tell you the smell emanating from that thing was 100 times worse than a few bags on the street.  Worst thing was, it came toward us and it left a lovely stench-ridden trail of liquid behind it...fantastic if you're walking that way.  I guess that's why the trash-heaver was running so fast beside the truck--he wanted to stay ahead of the reek.  Anyways, yesterday night my friend Andrea's friend Travis came to Seoul with his Korean bride-to-be, &#54788;&#51221;/Hyun Jeong.  We went to a Korean tuna restaurant, then to 'my' Outsider (where he tried  James Dr. Pepper : 1/2 pint beer, 1/2 pint Coke, 1 shot Amaretto dropped in and downed in 'one shot!') and then it was off to Sinchon for &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) and &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa, a mix of western pizza and Korean pajun/omlette) alone with &#49548;&#51452;/soju and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452;/dongdongju (literally comes from the fermentation process where dongdongju settles to the bottom of the vat and is separated from a clear moonshine-like alcohol by a thin layer of rice).  Let's just say that we had a pretty good time and Travis did quite well for a guy who doesn't drink too much: not even a hangover the next morning. But then, we got home pretty early, at about midnight; on a weekend we'd likely had been out til 4 or 6 or 8 in the morning.         "
"             Forgot I had this in my phone/camera.  Actually got a series going of this dude at one of these dance video games.  Think I remember seeing them in Vancouver too, but this ones is not just feet but arms.  There are lasers or something that sense where and how he moves his arms and if it's in sync with the instructions/music.  The guy was pretty thin and the moves made him look quite gay.  I wonder if he does these kinds of actions on the dancefloor...I wouldn't if I were him, the gals in the arcade/gameroom were really laughing it up (good thing the music was really loud).   urlLink     If this guy's got all the moves why are the girls laughing so hard??          "
"             There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed  urlLink 5-day work-week  coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as  urlLink this story  attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a  urlLink past blog , get ready for some comedy--and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics.   urlLink     Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid   They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work.  Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting.  Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was  urlLink (형님들의 도시)목포는항구다  (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint).   urlLink     Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot    urlLink King Arthur  was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out.  I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about  urlLink the actor, Ray Winstone,  I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life?   urlLink     Alex Bors and Mark...which is which?   I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for  that  one).  Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time.          "
"             Ok, it's not at all scientific. I was just taking a look through my millions of jpegs and such and found these two to be, well, eerily similar.   urlLink     DPRK's Kim Jong-il and U2's Bono   Is it me? Or does  urlLink North Korea 's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea/DPRK) 'Dear Leader' look at least a bit like  urlLink U2 's Bono? Of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but I get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long, the throngs of adoring fans (well, in Kim's case adoring may be a stretch) and accompanying entourage/roadies may have made them both a little distant from work-a-day realities. At least Bono doesn't require visitors to put  urlLink flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father , though.   urlLink Here's an interesting story  that's sure to attract an obliquely-worded press release from the North.          "
"             Just in time for Mel Gibson's  urlLink The Paparazzi  movie, here is a candid shot of Tommy from  urlLink &#54616;&#45208;&#46168;&#49483;/hana-dool-set  (1-2-3) fame!   urlLink     It's Tommy!   Actually, he's on the snippet-show  urlLink 'Wake-up'  where he and a Korean girl (and a lovable muppet-like friend) say simple phrases again and again and again...all to the same music everytime. ('I'm hot...I'm hot...I'm cold...I'm cold...I'm hhhhoooottt...I'm cccooooolllld') I tape it every morning for my kids back home and try to learn a bit of Korean...everyone speaks so (relatively) slowly on the show and uses simple tenses, which is good for us gringos.  It was pretty funny seeing him...it was at Starbucks in Sinchon and I immediately recognized him (well, seeing him everyday with his two-tone hair makes him an easy mark). I was waiting for a bud and he was with a gal so I didn't intrude...but I did intrude enough to take this pic. I was going to approach him, but then I thought it weird to act like a fan for a guy who's on a kid's simple English program; but I'm sure if my friend showed up before he left I'd have done something. I'll probably hear from his lawyers soon anyways, on account of the pic. It's tough to make out that it's actually him, so I doubt any of the local rags would give me much for it...there goes my dream of paying for my trip home with a snapshot.  It's weird, you know. There are so many celebrities in Seoul (especially in Yeouido, as the  urlLink MBC  and  urlLink KBS  broadcasting firms are located here). When I went to that  urlLink party after the MTV concert  my friends said they saw lots of 'talents' (singers, comedians, actors, anyone in the limelight) but I hadn't a clue who they were.  One time I was in the gym with my &#51109;&#51064;&#50612;&#47480;/jang-ee-neo-ruen/father-in-law and he introduced me to this guy while we were in the shower...he looked quite familiar but given the surroundings I couldn't quite place him. Then I got it...he was the anchorman from KBS news (now he's the Washington DC correspondent). There's also a popular comic performing in a bar in Yeouido (I think he's a part-owner of the place) but I had no idea until my junior from work told me (he got his autograph, too).  On another unrelated topic:  urlLink remember when I said that foreigners are buying up Korean companies?  Well,  urlLink looks like they've bought about 44%  (!) of the stocks on the Korean Stock Exchange. Wow, can you say takeover? What would happen if Americans bought large swathes of Canadian companies? Oh, ya, they already have. Anyways, some Koreans are calling foul (forgetting that you can't have capitalism without capital. The craziest idea is the one to levy a tax on the investing funds...ya, right...as soon as that gets serious many foreigners'll just sell pre-emptively and pull the rug out from many of the firms (not to mention the economy) here. Of course there'd be calls to prohibit capital from leaving Korea (as there was in the Park Chung Hee era (1961-1979) when emigrants could only take about $20 with them when they left the country--although I'm sure that didn't apply to government-types). That kind of thinking would put Korea about 10-20 back from where it is (which is, in many areas, 5-15 years back from the West).  That was close, almost sounded political there. Just so you know, I don't make this blog a sounding board for my political views, however when it comes to economics and business I think I have a relatively educated and experienced opinion...so be prepared to be bored (or aroused, depending on your view of the dismal science) every once in a while.         "
"             Man, with all that is going on I can see my posting to the ol' blog getting bogged down the next couple of week.  Got a ton of stuff to do at work as well as the trip (at which time I'll be in full-Daddy mode for the duration) which means precious little time to blog.  Well, we'll see how much I can relate to you from Canada.  In the meantime, take a look at  urlLink Shawn's blog .  He's got some funny stuff to say usually, although lately he's been a little infatuated with taking pictures of his chubby bod (for those of you who know...we have similar body types).  Later.          "
"             Korea's pretty funny sometimes.  Take a look at  urlLink this article  about changing the age of majority from 20 (already a year younger than the U.S.) to 19 (the same as British Columbia, Canada, but higher than the 18 that is prevalen federally and in some Canadian provinces).  Here parents are commenting on the ability to take on rights and responsibilities at the tender age of 19.   'My boy is almost an adult now and the law now even considers him a man, but he has to learn his responsibilities and accept his own choices in life,' Han Ho-sun, mother of a 20-year-old, said. 'But what does he know? He is not ready to make decisions as an adult yet. And if he is granted too much freedom, I'm worried he'll get himself into trouble.'   Other parents of young adults agreed. They nodded their heads to the idea that the government, before lowering the adult age, should provide training and programs to teach what adult responsibilities entail - such as building up a good credit record, making political decisions and getting married.   ' What? 19 years? Kids that age aren't really mature enough to handle anything! Let alone complete adulthood,'  said one parent who asked for anonymity.   The first two seem pretty sensible, but the last one (if the name wasn't withheld) would be prime fodder for the  urlLink Tonight Show's Headlines  segment, I think.  Then there's  urlLink this article  about the capture of an ex-convict suspected of stabbing to death two police offices a few days ago.  This part deserves special attention:   As police raided the house,  Lee injured himself by stabbing his abdomen and thighs several times  while holding a child and a 48-year-old woman as hostages to resist arrest.  He was immediately sent to Ehwa Womans University Mok-dong Hospital for emergency treatment...  What?  Did I just read that right?  The suspect stabbed  himself  enough to need to go to the emergency room?  What was he trying to do?  Commit suicide so as to evade capture?!??!  Methink perhaps the (can I say vengeful?) police on the scene may have helped him guide the knife  just a bit . Maybe he did stab himself, but it sure seems weird.   urlLink Here's an op/ed  on the capture and how it was handled by the police.           "
"             Ya, I'm off to Canada/Vancouver again soon...ah, to be back in the land of fresh air, real mountains and diapers. Luckily, I think my oldest boy is out potty-trained now. Not sure, though, haven't been home for about 2 months...and a lot can happen in that time.  Now that we've done a deal here my boss/CEO would have me here all of August (well, all of the year, actually) but I have to go back as it's my younger son's first birthday, or  urlLink 첫돌/Chot-dol  (they have a different name for almost everything here). For Koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies. 1st because the child made it through the often-treacherous first year (remember, Korea used to be really, really poor...so much so that is was a 100-days celebration as well, but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it). 60th because the  urlLink Korean Zodiac  is similar to the Chinese one...with 12 animals (ya, I'm a pig). There are also five colors which elude me at the moment, although I know two of them are black and gold. The Chinese use five elements: metal, earth, wood, fire and water. This year is  urlLink Year of the Wood Monkey , which I guess is better than 1981... urlLink Year of the Wood Cock/Rooster . (Hehe, had to put that in there.) Anyways, at age 60 you've gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colors/elements...a truly magical time, I guess. Thus, by age 60 men (no mention of women) should have at least one grandchild, preferably a grandSON--one more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wife's father's 60th year!  Now about foreingers (as I/we call all non-Koreans...even in Canada for some reason). Korea ain't called  urlLink The Hermit Kingdom  for nothin'. Basically, there are very, very few foreigners here. Something like 200,000 in a country of 48 Million. Most of us are (like me) in Seoul and (not like me) teachers. Others are manual labour workers from China, India and Southeast Asia (doing the  urlLink 3D-dirty, dangerous, difficult-jobs  that Koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass).  Foreigners (or 외국인/weigook-in or 외국사람/weigook-saram) are treated quite differently from native Koreans (and likely for good reason in some cases). We all need to register with our local 구/ku (ward/borough) office and do so (i) every 12 months or (ii) if we move to another 구 (whichever comes first). We get an Alien Registration Card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type (teachers are E-2, I fall under E-7 or 'other worker, director'). We need the ARC to get a job, get a bank account or do almost everything else official here. But it's not the same as a Korean Citizenship Card. Some promotions, for example the bonus card for  urlLink Fantaseum , is only for Koreans, not me. So I can't get 10% off movies or get bonus points there...waaaaaaaaa!  Also,  urlLink foreigners cannot easily buy land in Korea  (although I've also heard that it just can't be done...not sure who to believe on this).  urlLink Foreign investment companies, however, still did so --and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis. (In fact, they were the first firms in Korea to EVER use due diligence/research before buying and developing land...Korean execs, it seems, did it based more on intuition than anything else before then.)  It's also hard for foreign firms to get market share here--unless they partner with a local firm such as Otis did with LG Group concerning elevators and escalators. Heck, foreign car makers have just  urlLink 3% of the local market ! (Not counting GM's recent purchase of Daewoo Motors, which is a small player anyways.)  One thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled Korean companies. Korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible, but in the end they  can  take on foreign investors-- urlLink 대한생명/DaeHan sengmyung/Life aka Korea Life Insurance  is 5% owned by Australia's largest bank,  urlLink Macquarie Bank . Korean firms, however are loathe, it seems, to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses.  urlLink 교보생명/Kyobo Sengmyung/Life  apparently had months of due diligence done on it by  urlLink buyout firms , but in the end not enough was known to do a deal. Foreign firms have been able to  urlLink buy billions of USD in Korean stocks ,  urlLink SK Life ,  urlLink large portions of Korean banks ,  urlLink other firms  and one ( urlLink PCA ) is  urlLink in the running  to buy  urlLink 대한투자증권/DaeHan Tooja Jeunkwon/DaeHan ITC/Investment Trust Company aka Daetoo  (names here can get pretty long and complicated) though, so there is some opening up of this place.  Funny, the longer I'm here, the more normal all of this seems...not sure that is a good thing.          "
"             Ah, finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit. First was my cousin, Lars in May of 2003. He came at the perfect time. Weather was getting warm, but not unbearably hot and  urlLink Children's Day and Buddha's Birthday  were celebrated (day off) during his time here too. That was cool. Here are some pics from his visit. We did almost everything you could as a tourist for a short visit (but light on the bar scene as I was not as educated as I am now on it...and he was so young and impressionable at the time).   urlLink       Welcome to Korea...you must have SARS; Seoul City Hall traffic square;  urlLink Myoungdong  on the weekend; kids and wooden swords @ Korean Heritage Museum; us at the  urlLink Korean Folk Village ; on  urlLink the bus  heading to  urlLink Incheon Airport .   He had a fever (from a normal cold) a few days before he got here, so that and the general lack on English language ability by almost everyone here lead him to be delayed getting out of the airport by over an hour. Next time I'll give my visitors a little note in Korean to show the airport staff saying: 'I'm a top gamer from _______ please make sure I don't miss my tournament and speed me through customs quickly.' or some such thing--Koreans love their online games here; they even have a TV station dedicated to it.  Lars had this to report about Korea (and he's flown about 1,000,000 miles thus far): it's similar to Europe, but just LOTS more people.  The second person was a guy I met through a teacher in  urlLink Pusan/Busan  I know through a friend of mine in  urlLink Nanaimo  (my old roommate, actually; funny how things seem to dovetail as we get on in years). Anyways, her sister's bud is getting married to a gal in  urlLink Taegu/Daegu  and wanted some pointers on how to not screw-up in front of the in-laws-to-be. He was here for a week or so and in Seoul for a couple of days...but I think  urlLink we crammed a week of drinking into one night .   urlLink Yusheng  should have a good time here and should be here sometime in the fall, date to be determined. The guy's some kinda world traveler and he takes  urlLink some pretty cool pic of architecture  wherever he goes. I've noticed that many of them are devoid of human presence...something he'd be challenged to do in Seoul. There's always people around you here no matter the time or place. If you want to see some cool shots of my other hometown, Vancouver, take a look  urlLink here .  Ok, time to get my  urlLink pubmaps  out and plan Yusheng's course.          "
"             I think if I'm going to claim 여의도/Yeouido as my new hometown I should know something about it...and by extension you should too. I've got a little more to add to my  urlLink background on it thus far .  As you may know, ~do can mean two things in Korean. One is: province, such as 경기도/Kyunggi-do. The other is island, such as 제주도/Jeju-do (also spelled Cheju-do, depending on what era the map or publication was edited in...things changed in 2002, just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the World Cup). Since Yeouido (also spelled Youido, Yoido and Yeoido) is pretty tiny and part of 영등포구/Youngdeungpo-ku (ku is like a ward or borough such as Queen's or The Bronx) the ~do here signifies that it's an island. I had no idea that its ~do was 'island' because it looks as though they've filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated Yeouido from the mainland.  Anyways, way back when Yeouido used to be on the outskirts of Seoul and it housed the countries first real airport. (Later  urlLink Gimpo/Kimpo Airport  was built in the new outskirts of Seoul and now, since the city is not getting any smaller,  urlLink Incheon Airport  is the new International airport for Seoul; although Kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic.) In fact,  urlLink Yeouido Park , which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is, was the runway of that airport! So, here in West Yeouido, near the park, is where the streets are named 양말산/Yang-mal-san or 'sock mountain'. I got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain...there wasn't a sock factory here to my knowledge and I hadn't heard a story about removing one's socks for any reason (although I wouldn't dismiss it if I heard it; there are so many different traditions here). When I heard about the airport I came up with this theory: sock mountain is the hill (here they call a mountain what we in Vancouver would call a knoll, I find) where  urlLink the windsock  was placed. Make sense?  For more exciting and ground-breaking news stay tuned to this blog.          "
"             Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950. Let's just say that it's not near as lovingly embraced as in the West/US. Gays marrying in Korea? C'mon! There are no Korean gays! Of course, if one is gay one can hardly be Korean. I'm not trying to piss of PCers out there, this is just the way many Koreans (especially men and older ones) think. Although the younger generation are more open to other ideas, it's the older generation that controls politics, education, finance, and even media and culture to a large degree. The CEOs of the TV stations are all men and all old guys, as an example.  Things are changing, though, as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in Itaewon. (Now that you know its name you can either (i) know where to go or (ii) know where to avoid depending on your preference.)   urlLink     Yikes!   Here are a few websites on gays in Korea:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  urlLink This blog  has a tongue-in-cheek explanation of what being gay is...basically a primer in ' urlLink gaydar ' (how to recognize a gay in Korea or elsewhere). However, I think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics. It's pretty weird sometimes. In a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg (just above the knee) as he spoke of my experience in finance and what I do for the investment process. This would be outrightly gay, but in Korea it's ok...it just shows (non-sexual) fondness and a measure of trust between two people. My boss does it also...much to the surprise of foreigners in our group...but, again, it's not 'gay' its just the culture here. My wife's uncle holds my hand, too...and not for 2-3 seconds; for 2-3 minutes. At first I thought it was pretty weird, but it just means that he really likes me. (Having said all this I know I'll have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when I see my buds back in Canada, crap.)  Over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls, but it's just not sexual. Many young gals (especially) can be seen holding hands while walking down the road. Add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most Western guys. You get used to it, though.  I really wonder about some of these Korean guys, though.  urlLink The Face Shop  has a model on all of their (make-up) stores that's pretty gay looking. There are others as well. These guys are (I hope) more  urlLink metrosexual  than homosexual, although the distinction is greying. Many of the boy bands have similar dudes in them-the clothes, the hair, the dance moves. I got to really wonder sometimes. (Remember  urlLink this guy? )  Perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in Korea most gays don't come out of the closet--choosing instead to marry, have kids and be a 'normal' person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that they're too busy with their career to find a wife. Either way, it's quite different from in the West where there is more acceptance of such things.  On another topic: yesterday I had lunch with my CEO/boss and he mentioned that China and Korea were having a  urlLink tiff about the Gorguyeo Dynasty . He said, 'oh, how can you know about that...it is just Korean history'. Well, when I said that is was about 50AD-600AD and was concurrent with the Paekche and Shilla empires and before the United Shilla dynasty that preceded the closely-named Koryo Dynasty of about 1100-1300AD that was right before the venerated Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910 he just looked at me. Not sure if he got all of what I said, but a colleague dining with us said that I do, in fact, know about Korean history...hey, I've been here almost 2 years-and not all of it has been in the bars. My dates of Koryo are a little off, but if you want more information of where Korea came from take a look at  urlLink this site . It has a cool timeline...just right if you're writing a report! So, if you're speaking with a Korean don't be surprised if they assume that since you're a foreigner you  can't  know precisely anything about Korea--and if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here.  Oh, and just for the record:  I'm not gay.          "

"       of fresh air!  the fact that i am continually reminded that i am a trooper [despite all the trials i continually face] really helps me out a lot. you're given what you can handle, and suprisingly, that includes support. i'm just so painfully thankful for every person in my life. especially those of you who continue to remind me that i really am a good person.  i'm so glad tomorrow is sunday!  hopefully ka and his lady will be at church.  it will be really great to see their faces.  despite today being so long and trying, it was full of talks of faith, love and reminding myself that i am never satisfied with just knowing how to do one thing.  it was brought to my attention, that though i havent finished college, i have learned a a miriad of things i would have never learned how to do had i not followed that path i chose. i've learned such profound lessons and i don't know if i have ever been as satisfied with myself as i am right now. not to say i am happy to stay where i am, but i am excited to find out where i go next.  have you ever actually thoguht about how great the concept of  every day is a new day  its fascinating. mindblowing. and so true. each day is a fresh start! [even if your day wasn't bad, the next holds the chance for completely new experiences] i can not wait for tomorrow..  and this all came from a flat tire...         "

"       all i really did today was read and take a bath. i had a lot of things i NEEDED to do, and i basically just layed around all day. my focus was lacking and i feel like i have absolutely no direction. i'm absolutely dreading going to work the next 3 days.  weekends are bad enough, then you add the fact that its tax free weekend AND friends and family weekend.. its like retail hell. i dont know why i get so stressed out about life. its like i KNOW how to live right and i can apply it for a little while. then i just fall down. but ah. i'm just sad i guess. my sisters are going to college and moving out and i'm going to be here alone with my dying miserable parents asking me for moneyand screaming at me and with no friends. there is ZERO positivity in this place.. i'm really really afraid of the days to come.  i don't want to be like this.  i don't know what to do right now.  i'll just keep praying for answers, i guess.

"       so the Lord never ceases to amaze me... I mean, after all, he DID create us so anything is possible.. right? If before tonight I had any inkling whatsoever that he may not be working miracles, its been completely wiped away.  Going to church tonight,  I knew big things were in store. I knew God was waiting to burst in and do works that would add some sort of validity to our faith. WELL! praise God! The service started off normal enough. As normal as can be at DBC. We prayed and sang and things were going good. God was moving and I could absolutely feel his presence surging through the room. I've always heard pastor Cleetus talk about gold dust raining on everyone covering things,  fillings turning gold etc. But I've always remained skeptical because 'that type of thing just does not happen.' I couldn't have been more wrong! As we prayed, we asked for fire to fill our hands. That the lord would bless us and change us  and start a fire[etc etc same ol] Well as we moved on, I felt like I couldnt close my hands. They were physically heavy. I couldnt stop holding them out in praise..it was like i was holding a weight and I couldnt let go of it, I could share it but it wouldnt subside. I tried to ignore it and just rest my hands in my lap as Pastor went on, but it was soon brought to my attention that many of the other people in church.. I would say nearly half were experiencing the exact same thing. It was so insane. I've never seen or experienced anything like it. Something was obviously going on so we started to pray and ask God to continue to move. OUR HANDS! a person across the room noticed it first.. little sparkles  on their hands.. I looked down and they were forming on my hands as well! I didn't know what to do. I was elated. I just submerged myself in prayer. As I continued to pray, glancing down every few minutes more and more showed up until it was completely visible. gold dust! we always pray for gold, and there- before my own skeptic sight! a miracle! So as to not assume I was seeing things, I went and sat with my sisters and their friend Braidy, who had never attended church before. It was apparent they all were experiencing the same thing. The fire had came down from heaven. Meri was sweating and a burn-like welt appeared on her hand. They too had gold dust covering their hands. Noone ever saw it fall, but it definately formed on a majority of the people in attendances hands. I was afraid to touch anything for fear it would disappear. I can't explain it. But I am certain it was the Lord moving.  what a wonderful and magnificent creator we have. my mind is absolutely blown. praise God!          "
"       i thought i had something to update but nothing is new. i wish it wasn't so expensive to exist. i had a really bratty day.. fortunately it was made better this evening.          "

"       I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work.          "

"       Well I'm not sure what a Blog is and so this will be me figuring it out as I go.  LOL of all things I'm in a pretty crappy mood tonight too.  Joy.  I have lots I should be journaling about and I guess I might as well work on it here.  I used to have an Open Diary, a site that is still near and dear to my heart.  But that got compromised by someone and I took it down and then never had the umphf to start over.  Whats on my mind tonight.  Who knows.  Well what WAS on my mind this morning at work was this.  He spent the night last night.  That was cool, always is very nice to be in his arms.  To be aware of his warmth all night.  I actually didn't sleep much last night.  Told him this morning that I didn't know why but I do know.  I may only have 4 more weeks with him.  4 more weeks to last my lifetime of having someone hold me and love me for no reason, just because they do.  He holds me...all day sometimes.  I love the morning light shining on his face as he wakes next to me....his blue eyes gazing back at me with his soft smile.    Lying in the darkness, just before sleep sometimes he tells me things.  Last week he drifted off in my arms and when I had to leave he woke and told me he knew he was falling.  And I said I know.  I held him for longer before I finally had to leave.  The other night we were sleeping and he sat up in the night...sort of upset or sad.  He said baby i just don't want to lose you.  And I said so don't and held him and he fell back to sleep with me.  It's like his fears and heart show in the dark of night.  And I know because mine do too.  When we drank cider the other night...things started to be said that we feel...and are afraid to say.  I still can't say it so much in words.  I want to and I miss him so much tonight it aches.  But early this morning...before the sun rose, I looked over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest.  Said I love you baby.  I said I love you too...then I held him so tight....so much it hurt because I ache for him, ache to tell him what's in my heart.  Ache to be with him and really give all of me to him.  It's ripping me open that in a month or so it may be over.  Maybe not...but what if.  What if it all changes...we go apart...  I know we can live through that...but that's not the point.  I can't spend my life wondering what would have been if we had given this a real go.  In my dreams I want to share a home, to have him come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day.  I want to play our games and watch our movies and have our friends.  I want to see what our babies would look like and take them places.  To make pictures of us that match the dreams in my heart.  How could I have known that he would be so much so soon and that I would never want to let him go.    I think I'll stop with that cuz I don't wanna talk about what I don't wanna talk about anyhoo.                            "

I'm going to go see Troy today though.  Apparently it's three hours.  mmm  golden greek Orlando.  They really picked a great cast I think.  I have an enkai on Monday so it's going to be a busy, busy time for the next few days.       "
"                 Mood: sad and a little  upset.     urlLink I got to this page  because it was written on a buddys shirt in the Penny Arcade comic today.  Totally random thing to do really.  Then I clicked on the birds and the bees story, which is what the link goes to directly.  I read the whole thing, all the time thinking it must be a kind of satire or SOME kind of joke.  No such luck.  I'm sure the author would say that letting our children think being gay is O.K. is not a topic to joke about.   Sometimes, over here, when Sonia sees something on the news about America that shows something with a Bush view on it, she says she's kinda embarrassed to be American at that moment.   I'm not christian, but I am human, and this man makes me embarrassed for the human race.  It's a book, just because it's a very OLD book written when it was very common for scholars to take hallucinogens does not make it unquestionable.  That's pointless logic though because it's the type of thing that a person has to accept to believe and the people who would benefit from it the most are unacceptable to it.  It's a tough thing living on this planet with so many different people.  Each one seems to think that it's not enough to hold an opinion. They feel that that convincing someone else will justify their stance more.  It would be so nice if people would have the faith in themselves to hold their opinions and truly not care what others think.  So many people say that they are that way, but if they are then why are they trying to change my thinking?  It's not just about holding your own under fire, its about not firing on others as well.     I was thinking though, like that kids in the comic; people have to get their ideas from somewhere.  They are socially constructed.  Plus, once they have them, i would be folly to have them set in stone.  New ideas should be reviewed and judged on their own merits.  Unfortuatly, most new ideas get judged on whether or not they will suposrt that person's existing ideas, which is quite the same as having them set in stone.   I'm just trying to live in this world.  I'm not smarter than many, and no, your probably not more or less intelligent than me by any great extent.  Don't quote IQs at me, IQ isn't realism, or emotional sense. So many, many people who think that their particular education and personality makes them smarter. Everyone of those people will ignore a statement like that as well, maybe they don't think I'm intelligent enough to criticize them, they who KNOW what's right.  Just like the man behind that page. If you could live in someone else's head for a bit, I bet you'd be surprised to find out they're NOT beneath you.  They are a smart and reasoning human being with reasons for everything. If you fail to recognize that, then how smart are you?   I believe that man is wrong, with all my heart. He can have his opinion, he can even believe that printing anti-gay pamphlets is the right thing to do.  I'll still sit her and be sad for him.  We can all only live as ourselves.       "

Im pretty sure you have to sign into your blogger.com account to leave messages and some of my fine viewers don't have said accounts. (shame on you for not wanting to share with us, what don't you love us anymore?)  THUS, this chatterthingie!  You won't even have to wait for new windows to pop up.  Mind you it could get confusing if a comment up there is for a post down the page quite a bit... but I think this is my best solution.  I even managed to put it into the html template all by myself!!  I bet my parents are proud!    Speaking of the woooonderful people who brought me into this world... (and sometimes say they can take me back out and make another one look just LIKE me, hehe) I bet you'd get a great kick out of reading my profile.  I outlined my meager and short life span there.  It amuses me that it is all true to an extent, the only exceptions are the cheese dip and the siblings thing.

Well, I suposed that's just as likely to happen to tripod.  Mainly the thing is that I can psot to this blog using my k-tai (cell phone).  Which also means I'll have no reason not to post, so really I'm just making more work for myself.  And the advertisement at the top isn't too bad.  The only real drawback here is that the formatting is a bit too hard for me.  I dont have to know anything about html to make my Tripod blog look cool.  I'm sure I'll figure something out without having to resort to other peoples stuff.  If Tami or Andre know how it would be great if you could help me out.        "

It  will count later,  when it snows and I have to walk to school,  but even then it wont be bad. i hope everyones holding up well.   often think of the much worse things that some of you put up with, or had to deal with to get to where you are, or are worrying about for the future.

"                 Mood: aghast   I was supposed to go to art class today and I ended up with an extra class RIGHT in the same period!  poo, I really wanted to go to art class today too.    Classes today were rather amusing though.  Except Roxy's class, it took effort not to walk out she's just so annoying.  If I pause she'll whisper my 'line' to me.  I often feel like this is some kinda production.  Now they've gone and added the 'I can do this so well that I can do YOUR part too!' type.  And, of course, she DOESN'T do it that well anyway, she's so caught up in making sure they learn the exact grammar that they aren't gaining any communication skills.  *sigh*  I wish everyone could teach like Hatanaka Sensei.    I feel like I'm getting a cold. I already have a sinus headache, yuck.  Naruto is on tonight.  So, that's one happy thing.  I don't have a light in that room yet though, it's one of the things I'm supposed to buy myself.  It's really annoying to be in the dark at night, but I know I'll have a hell of a time finding someone to take me to Eden, they're all either busy or adverse to doing favors for people that don't directly gratify them as well.  It's a tough situation since I don't want a car.  Asking people for drives is such a touchy thing.  It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes. Douglas Adams      "

Kinda feeling the festivities from last night.  A little dehydrated, felt kinda nauseous after I had breakfast this morning.  Nothing huge.  The enkai was more fun than I thought it would be.  I'm still really home-sick though.  And the teacher that's like Roxanne apparently isn't any better at a party than at work.  The similarities are really uncanny.       "

It would not go over well in my current mood if I end up with people who don't talk to me.  Or the english teacher who seems to think I'm a lepper.  She's annoying.  She reminds me QUITE a lot of Roxanne.  Yes, you can see how well THAT must be going, ne?  Just today I found out she's hard of hearing, the poor dear.  She must not have heard me talking to her, sitting so far away at the desk beside hers and being the oh so quiet person you all know I am. ...  yeah.           "
"                 Mood: clean, of the squeaky variety...   Speaking of squeaks.  I was discussing animal sounds with one of the Japanese English teachers and mice in Japan go 'chu chu'.   On the topic of animals, there was a bug in my apartment when I came home yesterday.  A rather biggish type bug.  I couldn't squish it with a  urlLink shoe.   So I asked my neighbor to help.  I got the word wrong so at first she thought it was a cockroach and didn't know what to do, but then she saw it and it was a beetle so it was all good cause the kids keep them as pets and her son wanted it.  Thus I was saved.  Also you might be wondering where the birds and slugs part of the title comes in.  There was a slug in the lettuce that my land lady gave me when I went to her house.  Ugh.  I washed the lettuce, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat it after that.  I don't suppose you can really sterilize lettuce can you?  There were ants too, straight from nature that lettuce is.  This reminds me of the time I watched eXistenZ and I couldn't eat chicken for about a month.  No idea how long THIS will take...  And birds... well some of you might remember the little bird that was exploring my house the day after I moved in.  Some may not.  I was taking a nap and I heard scratching besides my head (cause this is Japan and we sleep on the floor) and when I turned I heard a bird take off and fly into the kitchen.  I never did actually SEE the bird in the house, only saw him a few minutes later when he was trying to find a way in the kitchen door.  Maybe to find out what that garganuan thing that scared him was...  Frigger must have been back the other day too, cause there's no other way that bird poop could get into my sink.  At least he had the decency to leave it in an easily cleaned place.  I'm animal bloody central lately.        "

I'm going to Tokyo next weekend, there many be a con involved so there may also be a Kiba and an Akamaru involved as well.  Do wish I had a barking one, but I don't at the moment.

It was fun, but much smaller than I thought it was going to be.  There were other Kiba's and even a Shino!  Fun!  I missed going to the Jump Shop though, we were 2 minutes too late.  I looked inside like a little orphan at the window.  They have the greatest stuff!  I plan to go back, maybe Wednesday before I leave.  It was very close to the station and easy to get back to.    Harry Potter comes out on the 26th here.  I may have to go by myself! *cries* I doubt anyone else will want to go.  mmm,  my parfait just came.  Don't eat by the computer they say...heh.  Im at an internet cafe and we had to order sopmething to  get to use the internet.  Pretty expensive parfait, but it has rasberries in it!!

Rain or no rain I MUST get to the post office today!!  I haven't mailed the gifts I bought my cousins from Kyoto, OR the stuff I got my mom and dad from Tokyo.  GAH!  I really need to get some cds as well so I can burn my anime onto cd.  Maybe burn off all my Naruto manga scans, I really want to send a copy to my cousin so I can get her addicted to Naruto, cause it's so great.  Cept for the current (coughdragonballcough) story arch.  Dragging one plot point out way to far. *sigh*  I made a chibi Akamaru yesterday, I'm going to put the finishing touches on him today.  Little things like attaching his head to his body, stuff like that.　　He’s designed so that his front arms will clip around a strap.  He’s also entirely hand sewn, the little bugger.  I think it’s not too small to be machine sewn, but somehow I ended up doing it by hand.  Stupid me.  I also seem to be way behind on my plots to take over the world, I’ll go think one up right now, but all I have is ms paint.  You’ve been warned.       "
"                 Mood: summer's here!    We had a typhoon yesterday!  We're very much inland so only the corner hit us but they still cancelled school with a flood warning.  The weather wasn't really bad though.    Still continuing my addiction to Ragnarok Online.  It's interesting that there's only one race in the game.  That's not really the norm now-a-days.  Your supposed to be able to be an elf or a troll or something.  The differences in Ragnarok are defined by your job, and you can change your job.  So that's kinda neat.  I'm thinking of getting an actual account if this survives the initial interesting phase.  So many things get thrown away after a few days or weeks with me.  I really haven't grown up much. (^_^)` heh.  Growing up is over ratted.  Other than that nothing much interesting has happened lately.  Classes are as boring as usual.  Tests on Thusday and Friday.  I will have to bring my laptop to school.  Maybe if I take it in the computer room and hook it up then I can play games or something!      "

"                 Mood: Hinata-Mode    I'm off to Nagoya this weekend.  I'm cosplaying Hinata this time. The third and last of the aforementioned 'set'.  (see below post) unfortunately I don't have the right stuff to make the Byakugan veins.  I'm going to get some of the stuff AFTER the con, I think that's irony.  I was reading a blog today, and it really struck me how lucky I am that my friends are who they are.  It strikes me a lot actually, I just would never have written it down before I got this blog last May.  It was someone I know back home, but noone that reads THIS blog me thinks, and it struck me because of how whiney they were.  Now, you may be confused at that, but this person isn't one of my friends, just a friend of a friend in a technical sense.  It was one of those moments where you get an insight into how petty people can be, and how some people can take every tiny thing that happens and make it bad so that its one BIG bad thing.  Then, because of that, they think the world is horrible to them and that  all people other than themselves are idiots .  That's really what bugs me, I  HATE  that attitude. You know them, the person who is complaining (maybe not ALL the time) but instead of sympathy you just look and think 'what?' Some people really DO have big bad things happen to them, and they might complain too, but I can be glad that they don't make a habit of writing off all the people who cause the problems as 'just idiots' or 'uninformed'. As a matter of fact I have learned so many things about positive coping with things from Shannys blog, its not even funny.  Id like to think that we know enough to say that they're idiots but people too.  I realize that it's too easy to belittle how other people feel because you aren't the one feeling it, but I also really respect people who can come to terms with the idea that EVERYONE has a brain, even if you don't see it most the time.  Gah, sorry to rant guys, but it does bug me when I see that part of some peoples personalities.  Makes me want to turn away and wait for them to move on.  Luckily,  I CAN !   WOO!    Wow this is starting to be a very long post, and you have to read through all my hate the bitches stuff just to get down to the good stuff.  Well... that would make   this   the good stuff, and I 'm not really sure I can assert that with any confidence. I CAN use large and metagrobolizing language to state it though!   ...yes, I looked up that word.  What, do I look like Jen?  Bet she even knew what that WAS!  It means confusing.  P.S.  The spell Checker told me to change Shanny to Shanghai... hehehe      "

So I could update my webpage and give you undeserving gits some pictures!!!  So you'd better head on over to  urlLink bakachan.com.  The layout is new, as are the spelling errors and the purikura section.  Make sure you go to the purikura, it's what I was working on all day.  I wouldn't have taken so long but I wanted the closeups to open in certain sized windows and they were opening off an image map so none of the html I used was working.  But I learned how to do  urlLink THIS  So, I debated making all the links like that, but it would have meant going back and cutting up the main page pictures and making a table that would work for it all an too much bloody hassle.  So deal with sloppy ugliness in the big picture presentations, that's all yer getting from me.  Oh and on a side note, I am now annoyed at my Hayate idea.  How dare he have that weird middle bang that hangs down so far, doesn't he KNOW thats just gonna be soo ichy!?  Good thing I have lots of extra hair from when I got it cut.  I have to make a little extension thing for the middle of my bangs.    mendoukuse naaa.   PPPPPS, Everytime I say 'mendoukuse' the teacher Im talking to will say mendoukuSAI.  I think theyre trying to get me to be less crass.   For those who have no idea what I mean, mendoukuSAI is like saying, 'oh, how troublesome'  whereas mendoukuSE has more of a 'what a &#%$ing pain in the A$$ this is'-kinda feel to it.  But of course since were still talking about japanese here, neither are really cursing at all, just different politeness levels.      "

I usually choose my characters based on a few things.   1. Can I look like them?  aka do I have the right hair without the annoyance of a wig?   2. If I have a great idea for the costume, like the Naruto sleeping hat.  Thats worth wearing a wig for. 3. Of course, if I WANT to.  I just HAD to have the bugs!!  THE BUGS!!!  (note: I still find random clay bugs in my apartment and often think they are real, causeing near death attacks of the heart)   Sooooo, most of you don't care.  But I had one of those epithanies today!  My action potential was firing away!!  Goes something like --> I looked in the mirror and scowled at the bags under my eyes, no amount of wearing my contacts will make them go away, I hate them!!  I look like friggin Hayate, *cough* *cough*  ... BING!  I HAVE that jounin vest! Ive been waiting for cooler weather so I could do Kakashi since wigs are kinda hot to be under.  BUT, I could soooo do Hayate!  I even have the right hair just now, my eartails are just by my chin line now since I have switched to Hinata hair.  (Just cut it yesterday) woooo.  I am very happy with this idea.    Oh and what IS up with the coughing?  Is that guy sick?  I mean he's a medical nin, how can he be perma-sick? And the BIG question?   Should I wear the little triangle that's the Japanese way of depicting a dead person or not?  I think so.         "

"             Okay, okay...I couldn't take it anymore. I needed a place to say a few things. Perhaps it will make some sense once I get warmed up to this?  What happened last night during Kerry's speech? I noticed him saying a few things that didn't make any sense. It reminded me of how my mother spoke after she had a STROKE. What is a menator? I swear I heard him say; 'Senators and Menators'...I think he was going to say; 'Members of Congress?' I see that others caught that 'hair pollution comment, too. I thought I was going to fall over when I heard that one.   Yeah, I mean, I can understand the pressure of this 'most important speech of Kerry's political career,' but...maybe intead of spending 30 minutes a day writing it, it should have spent 30 extra minutes a day reading it aloud to an audience. Maybe that hamster, Licorice is still alive? He could, at least, have read to him/her?  What is going on with this...missing out on mentioning Kerry's ex-wife and how he ANNULED that marriage?! I don't even consider myself more than a moderate sort of person and this even perplexed (okay, pissed me off) me! Did you see that movie? It says how he was a newlywed in Congress...then all of a sudden...he's married again. Oops. Forgot to mention what happened? I think not.  Stay tuned...         "

"             Yeah, someone has to write about this, don't they? It might as well be yours truly.  The cat population in my home changes all the time. I used to be of the mind that 2 cats were all anyone ever needed (one for each hand to pet) until I started doing animal rescue a few years ago. I promised myself and everyone who knows me that I would NEVER let it get out of control and certainly NEVER become a 'cat lady.' You know the type I'm talking about.  The most cats I've had here is 9. Currently, I have 5 cats and 3 'foster' cats. My house is large enough so everyone has a place they can call their own. Of course, having so many cats does have it's share of problems. It's time consuming to feed and clean litter pans. I have to vacuum all the time! Sharing a Queen-sized bed with my boyfriend gets difficult when 4 or more of the cats want to sleep with us. I can't count the backaches I've gotten from sleeping in weird positions so as to not roll over onto them. But..it is nice to wake up and see them all knocked out and happy, some even laying on their back with their paws up in the air.   Fortunately, I work from home so that gives me time to play with them and groom them daily. That said, just how much time can one devote to a cat when there IS work to be done? What happens if one of them doesn't get enough attention or one of them doesn't LIKE the other?  Fighting! Screaming! Breaking stuff...PEEING!!!!  There are times when I feel like I have a house full of 2-year olds who refuse to get along or behave for even a short period of time. I do my best not to play favorites, but my patience is challenged when it always seems to be the same few cats misbehaving.  Things have been relatively fine here until about a month ago when I started to discover cat piss in a few areas around the house. Bad sign. Once it starts it's tough to get it to stop. I know this since it happened a few years ago and it was a nightmare. This is even worse..now I have no sure idea as to who it is or if it is more than one of the cats.   Some fun places I've discovered the pee: • In the soil of some of my houseplants • On a SURGE protector for my stereo!!! • On two shirts that fell onto the floor (somehow!) • On my cute stuffed Chococat toy • On a folder full of my tax receipts from 2003! • Against my 1940's floorstanding radio ...and the winner... • on the edge of a guitar case...the pee travelled INTO the case and ONTO a 10-string guitar!!!!  Yes, I do know that peeing/spraying can be a sign of illness and one of the cats WAS sick. He was treated and is doing fine now. This just can't be a sick kitty since none of them are crying or showing other symptoms of illness. This is a, literally, PISSED OFF cat.  Honestly, I thought I had a BRAIN TUMOR for awhile. I had 'this smell' stuck in my nose everywhere I went. My boyfriend has bad allergies so he can't smell anything. Whatever I did, I kept noticing this odor. It was driving me crazy!!!! I didn't think it was cat pee because I thought I had found all of it! I even bought a black light so I could locate the pee more easily. Did you know black light makes the pee luminess?  I got really awesome enzyme neutralizer for the piss...that seems to help..but the cats are not going to stop. Every day something else gets ruined. So today I spent a huge amount of cash on an order of  urlLink The Comfort Zone Plug-In for Cats  and I'm starting to give the cats  urlLink Rescue Remedy .   If I was really smart, I would also get my butt on the cushion and do some  urlLink Shamata Meditation . Yes, I'm a Buddhist, too and this irritation is supposed to be joyful as this situation reminds me I'm on a path here and nothing is perfect nor will it last (ahh..impermanance again) forever.  Yeah, right.  Wish me luck.   Back to piss patrol.  Over and out.              "

"             File under: Too Weird to be True.  I dated a guy a few years ago. We were friends before and after we hooked up/broke up. This, in itself, is a miracle since, as most of us have discovered, break-ups mean never having to say ANYTHING ever again, let alone, 'Sorry.' The fact that we did remain good friends was very cool. We both dated other people and for awhile everything was fine. I was even helpful when his relationship came to a sad close. I was his ear, his confident, his buddy. I made up cool images for him to use on his new personal ad (when he was ready to start looking again). I even consulted with him on who might be a good choice to persue.  Then, 'she' came along. She found him. Not only did she find him, even though she didn't 'fit' his request of what he was looking for, he fell for her big-time. She is smart, funny, independent, a good mom. He said 'no one more than a few miles away from where I live.' She lives 65 miles away. 'No one with kids.' Oops...she has one. Doesn't matter. He's hooked. I expect wedding bells already and it's only been 3 months. He pretty much stopped talking to me about personal things. Yeah, he was busy with work ,but I was there for the bad times and now...well I just started to feel poverty stricken and lonely. Where was my buddy? He seemed to be gone.  I became obsessed with reading their blogs. I checked them almost every day. Each time I searched for clues. Did he love her more than me? Was she better than me? Were they having more fun than when we dated? I got to see pictures of them-a small peek through the door of their life together. I would see comments about cool furniture that my ex had in his apt...but did he ever tell anyone I picked it all out? She should probably love me just as much as him, since I had helped, behind the scenes, get him to do nice things for her (in the beginning before he closed off to me).  Then I went away on a Buddhist retreat for two weeks.  Part of what I learned while away was to focus on 'being' with irritation and be willing to just feel uncomfortable. The other part was to work on being open, instead of closed-off, closed-minded. I realized that the loss I felt was certainly natural since all things are in a constant state of change and change can feel painful. I also realized that instead of focusing on what I no longer had, I should take a better look around at my own life. I saw my relationship with a great man, who I have become tremendously intimate with. I finally feel comfortable around someone else. We have a radiance together. The problem was simply just learning to accept change, be open to what comes of it and stop being afraid...  ...and there she is. I am online. I am talking to my ex. He says; 'Would you like to meet K.?' Before I can answer...there we are, chatting away. I just went with it and I found things that really should not have surprised me. I think it was relief, actually. It was freedom. Whatever I was worried about fell away.   She is just as smart and capable and funny as I had guessed. I like her a lot. I think we will become great friends. I feel that already. I could have shut down and pushed this entire situation away. Instead, I not only get to maintain a very long friendship with my ex, but I get to be a small part of his life with K.   I sincerely feel a sense of amazement about this...and the extra shocker is she just offered up a project for me to work on. No, don't think she's being catty. Not. See, that's what comes of not clinging to the outcome, not being afraid. Once you let go of all that neurotic shit there's freedom.  [By the way, I do have to mention that K. also has extremely huge 'nuts' for being willing to chat with me, too. Yet another reason to be impressed with her. She is definitely a cool chick.]         "

"                  The Major League Baseball All Star Game was on last night, and after much pomp and circumstance, there was actually a game, and it did not end in a tie.  I got busy last night and lost track of time.  Coverage of the game started at 8:00pm.  I turned on the TV at 8:45 and they were still doing player introductions. I must give MLB credit here having the players come from the stands, across the top of the dugout and down to the field was a great idea.  Probably the only good idea MLB has had regarding the All Star Game in many years.  One question though, do pro baseball players think, 'God, I hope I don't fall down these steps in front of everyone,' just like the rest of us would. After player intros came the first pitch ceremony, which include Mohammad Ali, who gave us all a show by boxing the camera and Derek Jeter.  Then came the longest national anthem in recorded history, and at one point it look like the girl was actually in severe pain and collapsing like she popped a lung or something.  After all of this, I don't even know what time the game actually started, but I am guessing around nine o'clock.  This makes me wonder, if the All Star Game is an exhibition for the fans, why does it start so late that most fans went to bed long before the end of the game some time around 11:15pm.  Now I know the argument is that if it starts earlier the people on the West coast don't get home in time to see the game, and that may be true, but since it starts so late on the East coast, people here miss the end of the game. Here is an idea start all of the extra stuff and 7pm that way the game actually starts at 8pm and most of the country can see the end while people on the West Coast only miss an inning maybe two.  Now this is all if based on the premise that the All Star Game is an exhibition for the fans.  The problem is MLB cannot decide what they want the All Star Game to be.  They try to make it fan friendly by letting the fans vote for the starting line-up, but to make it more interesting they attached some value to the game by giving the winner home field advantage in the World Series.  This makes sense how?  In most leagues the team with the best overall record gets home field advantage, but not in baseball. In baseball home field advantage is decided by an exhibition game in which people outside of baseball select the starting line-up, and players from every team are represented.  If MLB wants a fan friendly exhibition don't attach it to home field advantage in the World Series. Let the vans vote for whom ever the wish, but show it at a decent hour.  If you want to make it a more meaningful game and give it meaningful importance like deciding which team get last licks in Game 7 of the World Series, then you need to make other changes.  If this game means something then the manager of each team needs to be able to pick the best team they feel is available.  The fans usually do a good job of voting, but occasionally a player gets to start that shouldn't.  This year's example is Jason Giambi.  Jason, while a good player is having and unusually bad year, has spent time on the DL, and in general is not putting up All Star quality numbers, yet the fans voted him to start.  Another change that should be made if 'this time it counts,' is the unwritten rule where everyone has to play, you mean to tell me that if we were playing a real meaningful game with last nights rosters any manager in MLB would ever pull Sosa and Bonds out of a game after two at bats each, no way in hell.  If this game meant something Bonds and Sosa both would have played the whole game, and you would never pull a guy who is used to starting after one inning in which he retires the side in order with two strikes, like happened several times last night.  The bottom line is if the game is an exhibition leave it as an exhibition, one game AL v. NL, don't attach a post implications to the game.  If you want the game to have meaning then it has to be played and run like a meaningful game.  Having it both ways is just plain stupid.  That is just one guy's opinion!         "
"                When has loyalty to your political party gone too far?  When it causes you to betray your family.  Dick Cheney is the Vice President and therefore number two in the Republican party.  A party that is going to try to get George Bush re-elected, and one of the campaign platforms of this party is a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  Cheney's daughter is an open lesbian.  Doesn't his support for this amendment betray his daughter? Is this the price one has to pay to be powerful, demonizing a member of their own family?  Is this how you repay the party that pulls your puppet strings, by supporting an amendment that will make it illegal for your loved one to marry the love of their life?         This country was founded on freedom, the settlers left England to escape tyranny, and gain freedoms.  Freedom of religion, freedom of expression, free press, and free speech, all of these were so important to the founding fathers of this nation that the are in the very first amendment.  Apparently this country's freedoms do not extend to you if you love a member of the same sex.  The Statue of Liberty does not read 'Give me your tired, poor huddled masses, unless you are gay and want to marry, then just go away.'  Why then are homosexuals treated as lesser citizens?  One thing I find funny is that people use religious arguments to support anti-gay legislation. Part of what make this country great is the separation of church and state, and the freedom of religion, so religion has no place in the debate of this constitutional amendment.  All of the ultra-conservatives religious fanatics that shout 'Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve,' need to realize that the freedom that gives them the right to believe that statement is the same freedom that gives people the right to go against it.         Dick Cheney's wife came out recently in an interview and said she believed it was up to the states to decide whether or not to recognize gay marriage.  That statement is in direct violation of the Republican line, and fall right in with the Kerry campaign.  I guess the puppet strings only reach so far.  As far as I am concerned if you love someone you should be allowed to marry them even if your names are Adam and Steve.  What's the big deal if Adam and Steve want to get married, if it makes them happy , why not allow it.  I think the President Bush would want as many happy Americans as possible, happy Americans vote for who made them happy.  I also think Big Dick needs to take a look in his own house before supporting a constitutional amendment that would take away freedoms from a member of his own family.  That is just one guy's opinion!         "

In the last Olympics he was a ring leader of one of the most embarrassing post race displays in which the Men's 4x100 meter relay team celebrated their gold medal by draping them selves in the American Flag and posing in front of photographers in a variety of poses usually reserve for a body building contest.  Then several months ago at a tune up meet for the Olympic trials Greene had a teammate spray his shoes with a fire extinguisher after he won the finals of the 100m dash.  The Olympics are based on the premise of world camaraderie through sports.  This does not include showing up all over your opponents with the actions of a testosterone enhanced peacock.  Olympic athletes are supposed to be ambassadors of this great country and are supposed to represent everything that is good about the United States.  Instead this year at the Olympics we will be represented by someone who has repeatedly represented every stereo type the world has for us.    One more note regarding the Olympics.  Many athletes from NBA, and the Williams sisters declined invitations to participate sitting security concerns as the reason.  I find this very self centered, there are literally hundreds to thousands of athletes in this country who would love to have the privilege of competing for there country.  I wonder if these people realize that the last terrorist attack that took place at the Olympics was in Atlanta, and was carried out by an American.  Grow up Serena, you are not that important that the terrorist are going to single you out, and didn't the last attack on a tennis player in a public place happen at a respected tennis tournament.  You have the opportunity to lead our nation to gold, and you back out and site security, give me a break, you probably want more time to design clothes or hob-nob with celebs.   That's just one guy's opinion!         "
